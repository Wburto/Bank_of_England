1999-02-10,"Inflation Report February 1999 The Inflation Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff  under the guidance of the members of the Monetary  Policy Committee.  It serves two purposes.  First,  its preparation provides a comprehensive and  forward-looking framework for discussion among MPC  members as an aid to our decision making.  Second, its  publication allows us to share our thinking and explain  the reasons for our decisions to those whom they affect. Although not every member will agree with every  assumption on which our projections are based, the fan  charts represent the MPC’s best collective judgment  about the most likely path for inflation and output, and the uncertainties surrounding those central projections. The Report has been prepared and published by the  Bank of England in accordance with section 18 of the  Bank of England Act 1998. The Monetary Policy Committee: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Alan Budd Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers The Overview of this Inflation Report is available on the Bank’s web site:   www.bankofengland.co.uk/infrep.htm.

Printed by Park Communications Ltd © Bank of England 1999 ISBN 1 85730 191 9 ISSN 1353–6737  i Overview Inflation on the RPIX measure was close to the 21/2% target level for most of last year.  Since the summer, however, economic developments both internationally and in the UK have substantially shifted the balance of risks to future inflation.  This sharp deterioration in prospects for the world economy has worsened the outlook for UK exports, and domestic consumption growth has weakened.  Moreover, the available evidence from the labour market and international price developments suggest that, in relation to demand, inflationary pressures have eased, at least for the time being.  The Monetary Policy Committee has therefore reduced interest rates in recent months with the aim of keeping inflation on track to meet the target. Growth in the world economy in 1998 is likely to have been broadly as expected at the time of the November Inflation Report, but prospects for the period ahead have worsened.  The difficulties facing some emerging market economies were highlighted by the collapse in  mid January of the exchange rate regime in Brazil.  Net capital flows to emerging market economies are likely to fall further, which entails weaker net exports for industrialised countries as a whole.  If world demand growth is not to decline, higher domestic demand growth in those countries will be needed to offset weaker net trade.   The recession in Japan appears likely to be more protracted than previously anticipated.  Prospects for growth this year have weakened in the euro area.  And there are downside risks to the remarkable buoyancy of domestic demand and output growth in the United States, where large external imbalances have been accumulating for some time.  The probable consequences of these international developments and risks for the UK are weaker export growth, and even lower imported inflation.   Aggregate output growth in the UK has slowed broadly as expected at the time of the November Inflation  ii Inflation Report:  February 1999 Report.  Growth in the third quarter of last year was revised down slightly to 0.4%, and the preliminary estimate of fourth-quarter growth was 0.2%.  Survey measures of business and consumer confidence have stabilised since the autumn, albeit at low levels, and there is now somewhat less of a contrast between indications from official and survey data.  But the sharp contrast remains between output growth in the manufacturing and service sectors.  Household expenditure has been weaker than expected in relation to income and wealth, and part of this weakness is expected to persist.  Inventories have grown more than anticipated, perhaps in large part involuntarily, and a substantial unwinding of stocks remains likely in the period ahead.  Public expenditure is set to grow significantly, particularly for investment.  But business investment growth, which has so far remained robust in the service sector, will probably slow sharply despite falls in the cost of capital.  Annual broad money growth has continued to ease, in line with slowing nominal demand growth.  Total credit growth has also moderated.  Within this, unsecured lending to the personal sector continues to grow fast, but there is evidence that this is partly displacing other forms of household borrowing.  The financial positions of both the personal and company sectors appear reasonably sound overall. Unemployment has declined slightly over the past three months, and the claimant count is at its lowest level since 1980.  Employment growth has been strong, despite the slowdown in output growth, though hours worked have grown more moderately.  But recent evidence on vacancies, recruitment intentions and reported skill shortages indicates that the labour market is no longer tightening. The degree of inflationary pressure in the labour market is especially hard to gauge given the continued suspension of the official Average Earnings Index pending the independent review commissioned by the Chancellor.  The available evidence, including information from the Bank’s regional Agents, suggests that private sector wage settlements have stabilised over the past nine months, despite the cumulative tightening of the labour market.  Wage drift—the difference between earnings growth and settlements—is likely to be decreasing at the current stage of the cycle.  Although recent public sector pay settlements were higher than a  iii Overview year ago, and both the Working Time Directive and the National Minimum Wage are likely to increase labour costs to some degree, upward pressure on overall pay growth appears to be easing.  This has led the Committee to lower significantly its profile for nominal earnings growth. This is consistent with lower inflation expectations. Measures of expected inflation—whether based on surveys or on the difference between nominal and index-linked bond yields—have fallen steadily over the past year, in many cases to levels around the 21/2% inflation target.  And headline RPI inflation is likely soon to fall below RPIX inflation for a period as recent cuts in interest rates reduce mortgage interest payments. The current projection for the growth rate of GDP— based on the assumption that the interest rate remains constant at 5.5%—is shown in Chart 1.  The central projection is for the four-quarter rate of GDP growth to slow to between 1/2% and 1% during this year before recovering to around trend by the middle of 2000 as domestic demand picks up.  Quarterly growth is expected to be close to zero in the first half of this year. The corresponding projection for RPIX inflation is shown in Chart 2.  The most likely path is for inflation to stay close to target over the next two years.  But there is considerable uncertainty surrounding this projection, not only because of the current difficulty of assessing labour cost pressure.  Indeed, some Committee members took the view that the inflation profile should be about  0.2 percentage points lower because of somewhat stronger productivity growth, or weaker world prices, than assumed in the central projection. The Monetary Policy Committee has acted in response to deteriorating prospects for external and domestic demand, and the more benign prospect for both imported and labour cost inflation, by reducing interest rates from 7.5% to 5.5% over the past several months.  Output growth at home has fallen—although broadly as expected in the November Report.  The prospect remains one of a temporary slowdown followed by a pick-up of growth to around trend next year.  The inflation outlook is uncertain.  Inflation outturns in the past six months, inflation expectations on most measures, as well as the Committee’s central projection for inflation, are all now close to the 21/2% target level.  Future changes in interest rates will depend upon how the outlook for inflation evolves.

It eased further in the last three months of 1998, largely reflecting a contraction of balance sheets by the non-bank financial sector.  Total M4 lending growth also slowed in 1998 Q4, even though unsecured lending to individuals grew by close to 20% on a year earlier.  World financial markets remained volatile. Government bond prices rose, particularly in the United Kingdom.  And despite a temporary decline following the devaluation of the Brazilian real, equity prices in most major industrialised countries were higher than in the autumn. The MPC has voted to cut the Bank’s repo rate on three occasions since the November Report, by a total of  1.25 percentage points, to 5.5%. 1.1 Money Notes and coin in circulation rose by 0.6% in  January 1999.  The three-month annualised growth rate in notes and coin rose to 6.2% in January, compared with an average rate of growth of 5.3% in 1998.  Growth in notes and coin has in the past been correlated with nominal retail sales, but the rise in notes and coin since October could also have reflected the falling opportunity cost of holding non interest bearing money as interest rates were lowered. Annual growth in broad money slowed to 8.1% in the final quarter of 1998, its lowest rate of growth since 1995 Q2 and down from 11.9% in 1997 Q4 (see  Table 1.A).  Annualised short-term rates of growth were below the twelve-month rate, indicating that annual growth is likely to slow further.  Adjusting for inflation, real broad money growth in the year to 1998 Q4 was 5.6%, down from its peak of 9.1% in 1997 Q2, but still above the average rate of growth since 1992 of 4.3%. The slowdown in real M4 growth is consistent with the weakening outlook for real activity, but historical comparisons suggest that there is often a lag between real M4 and GDP growth (see Chart 1.1).   The medium-term implications of broad money growth for inflation depend on the relationship between nominal Table 1.A Growth rates of M4 and M4 lending(a) Per cent 1998 3 months (b) 6 months (b) 12 months M4 Q1 8.1 9.4 10.0 Q2 9.0 8.6 9.4 Q3 8.7 8.9 9.2 Q4 6.3 7.5 8.1 M4 lending Q1 9.1 9.0 8.4 Q2 6.9 8.0 7.6 Q3 9.4 8.1 8.6 Q4 4.9 7.1 7.6 Source: Bank of England.

But M4 velocity has been unstable over recent decades.  Chart 1.2 shows that the ratio of nominal GDP to the stock of broad money fell sharply in the 1980s and, after stabilising in the early 1990s, has fallen again since 1995.  There was a corresponding rise in M0 velocity during the 1980s (see Chart 1.2).  The shifts in broad and narrow money velocity in the 1980s reflected the impact of financial liberalisation and a variety of financial innovations, which increased sterling deposits but reduced the demand for notes and coin.  These factors appear to have been less important in the 1990s, which would be consistent with the stabilisation of M0 velocity since 1992, but does not explain the continued fall in M4 velocity. Other financial corporations (OFCs) At a sectoral level, the fall in M4 velocity since 1995 has primarily been accounted for by higher deposits by other financial corporations (see Table 1.B).  OFCs are  non-bank financial intermediaries, which specialise in buying and selling financial contracts and securities.  As such, this category covers a wide range of institutions including securities and derivatives dealers;  mutual, unit and investment funds;  and institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance companies. The annual rate of growth in OFCs’ deposits has slowed during the past year.  But growth of 16.0% in the year to 1998 Q4 was still considerably stronger than the growth in either personal or corporate sector deposits.  Annual growth in deposits held by non-bank financial intermediaries has averaged 22.3% since 1995, compared with growth of 6.6% and 6.5% in household and corporate deposits respectively.  So although they hold only around one fifth of the stock of M4, OFCs have accounted for 45% of the increase in aggregate broad money since 1995.  Chart 1.3 shows that excluding these deposits, the rise in broad money growth since 1995 has been much less marked, and remained close to 6% during 1998.  The velocity of M4 excluding other financial corporations has therefore also been more stable since 1995 than aggregate M4 velocity. The implications of the behaviour of deposits held by non-bank financial intermediaries for activity and inflation are not straightforward.  Their demand for money depends largely on portfolio considerations such as the relative rates of return in the money, equity and bond markets, and on assets such as physical capital or land, rather than on the demand for goods and services.

Money and financial markets 5 Previous Reports have highlighted the upside risk to consumption if these balances were run down through purchases of financial assets.  But changes in other financial corporations’ M4 deposits have been closely correlated with changes in their borrowing since 1990 (see Chart 1.4).  And there was a corresponding slowdown in borrowing by non-bank financial institutions in 1998 Q4 (see Section 1.2).  According to the latest Merrill Lynch-Gallup survey, UK fund managers planned to reduce the proportion of their holdings in cash in January for the fifth successive month;  and the share of M4 in pension fund assets fell to 5.3% in January from 6.4% in November.  If OFCs’ M4 growth continues to decline, that could stabilise M4 velocity. Household sector Households’ M4 deposit growth had been on a downward trend since 1997 Q4.  But it picked up in  1998 Q4, and was 6.4% higher than a year earlier, compared with a rise of 6.0% in the previous quarter. One possibility is that the rise in households’ M4 deposit growth reflected a rise in precautionary saving, which would be consistent with the slowdown in consumer spending. Private non-financial corporations (PNFCs) Corporate M4 deposits fell by 0.2% in 1998 Q4, and were only 3.5% higher than a year earlier.  Lower corporate deposit growth could be consistent with the slowdown in nominal demand and a reduction in cashflow (see Section 2). 1.2 Credit Annual growth in bank and building society lending to the rest of the private sector (M4 lending) has slowed in the past year, from 9.0% in 1997 Q4 to 7.6% in 1998 Q4 (see Table 1.A). Concerns about a possible sharp restriction in the amount and/or increase in the price of credit, following the financial turbulence in the autumn, have eased further. The devaluation of the Brazilian real had a significant impact on emerging market debt spreads.  But there was little impact on credit spreads in the major industrialised economies, which remain above their levels at the beginning of 1998, but have fallen since October.  Bank estimates of the real yields on corporate debt for all but the lower credit-rated companies have fallen back to Chart 1.4 OFCs’ M4 deposits and lending(a) 10 20   0  10  20  30  40  50  60 1975 80 85 90 95 + _ Lending Deposits Percentage changes on a year earlier Source:  Bank of England.

Other financial corporations In line with slower growth in OFCs’ M4 deposits, annual growth in M4 lending to the non-bank financial sector has fallen markedly since the end of 1997.  More recently, this slowdown in borrowing has been evident in OFCs’ reverse repo activity.  Reverse repos, which are mostly conducted with OFCs, were £5 billion lower in 1998 Q4 (not seasonally adjusted) than in the previous quarter, and have made a negative contribution to aggregate M4 lending in four of the past five months. Within the non-bank financial sector, borrowing by securities dealers fell by £11.5 billion (seasonally unadjusted) in 1998 Q4.  Lower borrowing probably reflected a desire by the non-bank financial sector to reduce the size of its balance sheets towards the end of the year, in the light of financial market uncertainty and in advance of the introduction of the euro.  These effects could therefore partly be temporary and may subsequently be unwound. Private non-financial corporations The annual rate of growth in M4 lending to the corporate sector rose to 6.4% in 1998 Q4, compared with an average rate of growth of 4.2% since 1992.  That indicates the continued availability of credit to the UK corporate sector.  Chart 1.6 shows that firms tend to finance imbalances between current income and expenditure mainly through borrowing from banks and building societies, rather than through changes in other forms of borrowing or asset holdings.  Many firms rely on short-term debt to finance inventories and working capital, and it is possible that the strength of corporate borrowing has been associated with recent higher levels of inventories (see Section 2). Household sector In contrast with the decline in households’ deposits growth since 1997 Q4, the annual growth rate of M4 lending to households picked up during 1998.  The amount outstanding was 7.5% higher in the final quarter of 1998 than a year earlier.  Total lending to households can be divided into lending secured on dwellings and unsecured lending.  Secured lending, which accounts for about 85% of the stock of borrowing by individuals, has been growing annually by around 6% since 1997 Q1. But growth in unsecured lending, which accounts for the Chart 1.6 Corporate financial balance and M4 lending  flow 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  0  1  2  3 1987 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 + – Per cent of GDP M4 lending flow (a) Financial balance flow Sources:  Bank of England and ONS.

Money and financial markets 7 rest of borrowing by individuals, has picked up markedly during the past four years, and was nearly 19% higher than a year earlier in 1998 Q4 . As a proportion of consumption, unsecured lending rose from almost zero in 1992 to 2.4% in 1998 Q3.  But this may partly reflect a substitution away from other forms of borrowing.  Unsecured lending accounted for only 13.5% of total lending to individuals at the end of 1997, but for nearly one third of the rise in borrowing by individuals during 1998.  Credit card borrowing has been particularly strong (see Chart 1.7).  That probably reflects the growing use of credit cards as a means of payment, and more competitive supply conditions.  The share of new credit card business accounted for by market entrants since 1990 rose from 10.7% in  January 1995 to 22.6% in January 1999.  Conversely, net mortgage equity withdrawal, which was an important source of funding for consumption in the late 1980s, has been negative during much of the present recovery, and was close to zero in 1998 Q3 (see Chart 1.8).  Lower net mortgage equity withdrawal could reflect a number of factors.  In particular, the gradual recovery in the housing market since 1990 probably reduced the demand for equity withdrawal.  Housing turnover has been considerably lower in the 1990s than it was in the previous decade, and house prices remain below their previous peak in real terms.   However, the rise in total borrowing for consumption— consumer credit and mortgage equity withdrawal—does not look remarkable in relation to total household spending (see Chart 1.9).  Compared with the stock of wealth, which has been boosted by the rise in share prices, the level of total indebtedness remains historically low.  And in relation to total income, the level of household debt has been broadly constant during the present recovery, at slightly below the level at the end of the 1980s.  (See Section 2 for a more detailed discussion of recent trends in consumption.) 1.3 Interest rates and asset prices Short-term interest rates The MPC voted to cut the Bank’s repo rate by  0.5 percentage points to 6.25% at its meeting on  9–10 December, and by a further 0.25 percentage points, to 6.0%, on 6–7 January.   At its 3–4 February meeting, the MPC voted to reduce the Bank’s repo rate by another 0.5 percentage points, to 5.5%.

Inflation Report:  February 1999 8 Risk-neutral probability distributions of expected  three-month market rates derived from options prices on 4 November and 3 February are shown in Chart 1.10. Uncertainty about the likely path of interest rates over the next year, as measured by the width of the blue fan, has diminished since November and since interest rates began to be reduced in October.  A smaller weight is being attached to the possibility of a rate rise.  Market expectations as at 3 February for the most likely outcome, shown by the darkest blue band, were for a further fall in interest rates over the next year, to between 5% and 51/4% by the final quarter of 1999.   The US Federal Reserve cut its official rate by  0.25 percentage points on 17 November.  Short-term interest rates among countries participating in EMU converged at 3.0% in advance of the introduction of the euro on 1 January.  Probability distributions of expected three-month market interest rates for the euro area, derived from option price data on euribor contracts, show that short-term rates in the euro area are expected to remain close to their current level over the next year (see Chart 1.11).   The impact of monetary policy on the real economy depends on the real rate of interest, which is not directly observable and depends on inflation expectations. Survey-based measures of UK inflation expectations for the next two years fell during 1998 and are now on average close to the inflation target.  So adjusting the nominal UK interest rate of 5.5% for inflation expectations, the current short-term real rate is likely to be around 3%.  That is somewhat below the average long-run real rate derived from the gilt market since 1982 (see Chart 1.12). Long-term interest rates Nominal yields on UK government bonds at all maturities have been falling since 1996, but have fallen particularly sharply since the November 1998 Report. For example, between 11 November and 3 February, two, ten and fifteen-year yields fell by 74, 71 and 65 basis points to 4.73%, 4.23% and 4.27% respectively. Many of the factors underlying the falls in long-term nominal UK bond yields are likely to be international, rather than specific to the United Kingdom.  But the fall in UK bond yields has been more marked than elsewhere.  The differential between the ten-year UK spot yield and the US Treasury spot yield was negative Chart 1.10 Implied distribution for sterling  three-month interest rate 3.25 3.75 4.25 4.75 5.25 5.75 6.25 6.75 7.25 7.75 8.25 8.75 Per cent 0.00 Expectations as at c.o.b. 4 November 1998 1995 98 96 97 99 3.25 3.75 4.25 4.75 5.25 5.75 6.25 6.75 7.25 7.75 8.25 0.00 1995 96 97 98 99 Expectations as at c.o.b. 3 February 1999 Per cent 8.75 Sources:  LIFFE and Bank of England.

So at any given point, the depth of shading represents the height of the probability density function implied by the markets over a range of outcomes for short-term interest rates.  The markets judge that there is a 10% chance of interest rates being within the darkest, central band at any date.  Each successive pair of bands covers a further 20% of the probability distribution until 90% of the distribution is covered.  The bands widen as the time horizon is extended, indicating  increased uncertainty about interest rate outcomes.

Chart 1.13 shows a combined yield curve derived from German and French government bonds, which can be thought of as representing market interest rate expectations in the euro area.  It shows that implied  long-run forward interest rates for the United Kingdom are below those for the euro area and the United States. However, information derived from swaps data, which includes an implicit credit risk, suggests that sterling nominal forward interest rates are expected to converge with those in the euro area.   Changes in nominal interest rate expectations reflect revisions to expectations about inflation or real interest rates, or both.  A risk premium may also be priced into the nominal yield curves of some countries, reflecting past inflation surprises.  Chart 1.12 shows ten-year forward nominal interest rates since 1982. The expected rate of inflation in the United Kingdom over the next ten years, inferred from conventional and index-linked gilt prices, has fallen sharply since 1997. But it has been little changed since November, at  slightly above the inflation target of 21/2.  The fall in nominal yields since November largely reflects a fall in the real UK yield.  The real yield on index-linked UK government bonds has been falling since 1996, and particularly since October, to below 2%—its lowest level since index-linked bonds were first issued in 1981. International comparisons of real long-term yields are difficult to make, because of the scarcity of index-linked bond issues.  But there has not been a corresponding fall in the real yield on index-linked US bonds.  Previous research suggests that fiscal considerations are important determinants of long-term real world interest rates.  With the exception of Japan, the ratio of debt to GDP has fallen in most major economies since 1996.  Moreover, the move into budget surplus in the United States and the signing of the Stability and Growth Pact by prospective EMU participants suggest that this trend is unlikely to be unwound during the next few years (see Table 1.C). Institutional factors, such as the minimum funding requirement for pension funds, may also have put upward pressure on the price of UK index-linked bonds by raising demand relative to supply.  Nonetheless, the sharp fall in UK real yields relative to those overseas remains difficult to explain, given the underlying determinants.

Inflation Report:  February 1999 10 Equity prices Share prices in the United States, France and the United Kingdom had by mid January reversed most of their falls in the autumn (see Chart 1.14).  There was also some recovery in share prices in a number of emerging market economies, with the exceptions of Russia and Brazil (see Chart 1.15).  The devaluation of the Brazilian real on  13 January led to an immediate fall in global equity prices.  The subsequent decision to allow the real to float triggered a recovery in most of the major markets.   There are a number of possible explanations for the rise in share prices since October.  The value of an equity can be thought of as the discounted stream of real dividend payments derived from that equity.  So changes in equity values reflect changes either in expectations about future real earnings, or in the discount factor, which is made up of a risk-free real return and a risk premium.(1) The  risk-free real return as proxied by the real yield on government bonds has fallen, as noted above.  Chart 1.16 shows that the recent rapid increase in the FT-SE All-Share Index appears to be more closely correlated with falling real bond yields than with rising profits. Estimates of the equity risk premium vary widely, but most have fallen in recent years.  In general, the recovery in share prices in industrialised economies has not been evenly spread between different industrial sectors and firm size.  The box on page 11 considers the sectoral equity price split in the United Kingdom, the major European markets and the United States. The MPC assumes that there is a greater risk of a fall in UK equity prices than of a further rise, relative to the central case assumption of growth in line with nominal demand. Property prices According to data from the Richard Ellis Research Consultancy, annual growth in the capital value of commercial property slowed in December, in line with the decline in rental value for industrial property. Expectations of future rental values are an important determinant of current property prices, in much the same way that current share prices depend on expected future dividends.  Property company share prices have fallen relative to the FT-SE All-Share index since May 1998, and were around 20% lower at the end of 1998 than at the beginning of the year.  According to the Merrill (1) See the box on page 12 of the August 1998 Report for a more detailed discussion.

Money and financial markets 11 Sectoral equity prices Share prices in most of the major industrialised countries have risen since October (see Chart 1.14 in the main text).  But this masks significant differences in share price movements between industrial sectors and between firms of different sizes.  Chart A shows the performance of different sectoral share prices in the United Kingdom since the start of 1998.  Share prices in the utilities, consumer goods and services sectors rose by around 20% between October and the beginning of February, to close to their peaks of mid 1998.  But share prices in general industrials have recovered significantly less of the ground they lost in the summer. During 1998, UK share prices have risen most in sectors that are relatively less exposed to overseas developments. Chart B shows a similar pattern in other major EU markets.  This could suggest that market confidence in either the future growth of export markets or the ability of firms to compete with imports from outside the EU, is less robust than that for the domestic EU economy. In the United States, however, share prices of general industrials and services have moved more closely together (see Chart C).  That may reflect the relatively smaller share of trade in US GDP, notwithstanding the recent weakness in US industrial production and profits.  The share prices of different-sized UK firms have also varied widely.  Chart D shows that since October, share prices of small-capitalisation companies have risen by considerably less than the average.  Another way of looking at relative share price performance is to relate the change in share prices to earnings.  The price:earnings ratio on the FT-SE Non-Financials index reached an  all-time high of 24 in January.  That compared with a value of 21 before the stock market crash in 1987.  By contrast, the price:earnings ratio on small-capitalisation firms was less than 16, down from 29 in March 1998.  It is difficult to find a single explanation for these differences, but one possibility is a rise in the return investors require for holding less-liquid stocks.

Inflation Report:  February 1999 12 Lynch-Gallup survey of fund managers, the net balance expressing a desire to buy property shares has been negative since July 1998. Housing market activity and house price inflation have continued to ease.  The Nationwide measure of annual house price inflation was 7.4% in January, nearly  6 percentage points below its peak at the beginning of 1998.  The Halifax measure of annual house price inflation fell to 4.5% in January, below the 5%–6% band in which it had been for most of 1998.  The less timely measure calculated by the Bank based on Land Registry data also showed a slowdown in annual inflation, to 7.6% in the year to 1998 Q3, compared with 8.9% in the previous quarter.  Regional differences in house price inflation, as measured by the Halifax, have narrowed slightly since 1997 Q4, mainly owing to slowing house price inflation in Greater London and the South East (see Chart 1.17). 1.4 Exchange rates The sterling effective exchange rate index (ERI) averaged 100.1 in the 15 working days up to and including 3 February.  This is the starting-point for the current projection, and is slightly above the central projection for 1999 Q1 implied in the November forecast. Sterling was little changed since November on both  the narrow and the broader measure of the ERI.  The latter also includes some of the Asian and Latin American economies (see Chart 1.18).  And sterling has traded within a fairly narrow range against the euro, between 0.72 and 0.69, since its introduction (see Chart 1.19). Chart 1.20 shows the path for the ERI implied by market nominal interest rate differentials, calculated by comparing UK expected interest rates at different maturities with expected rates overseas.  This method is based on the assumption that, other things being equal, currencies should adjust to equalise the rate of return on assets across countries.  So if UK rates are expected to be above those overseas, sterling is expected to depreciate.  As the chart shows, the path based on expected interest rate differentials implies a slight depreciation of sterling up to the forecast horizon.  But further out, sterling is expected to stabilise and then to appreciate, reflecting expectations for lower relative UK nominal interest rates, as discussed above.

Money and financial markets 13 In constructing its forecast, the MPC makes assumptions about the future path for sterling, conditional on unchanged UK interest rates.  In judging the most likely path for sterling, the MPC takes into account both interest rate differentials and risk considerations.  In the central projection (the modal or most likely case), the sterling ERI is expected to fall to 97.6 at the two-year horizon, but the MPC judges that a larger fall is more likely than a significant rise.  So on average, the sterling ERI is expected to fall to 96.3 in two years’ time. 1.5 Summary UK broad money growth has continued to ease, in line with slowing nominal demand growth.  Unsecured lending to individuals has continued to grow at close to 20% on a year earlier, but this probably reflects a substitution away from other forms of borrowing. Global yields on government bonds continued to fall in line with lower global inflation expectations and lower expected real yields.  The fall in nominal UK bond yields was particularly sharp, primarily reflecting lower real yields, the reasons for which remain something of a puzzle.  The exchange rate was little changed since the November Report, but is expected to depreciate up to the forecast horizon.

UK exports of goods and services fell in 1998 Q3 and global economic prospects have continued to deteriorate, increasing the downside risks for UK trade and output. Consumption growth has also slowed, consumer confidence has fallen sharply, and business confidence remains low.  Reflecting these developments, GDP increased by only 0.2% in 1998 Q4, its slowest quarterly growth rate since 1992 Q2.   2.1 External demand(1) The growth rate of UK export volumes for goods and services has slowed markedly since mid 1997, largely reflecting weaker exports of goods to non-EU countries (see Charts 2.1 and 2.2).  In particular, the recession in Japan, the financial crisis in East Asia, and the marked fall in the price of oil since January 1997 have caused a sharp contraction in demand among Asian economies and oil-exporting nations (see Table 2.A).  Even though these countries are the destination for only about 15% of UK exports, the decline in their demand for UK goods has been large enough to offset the continued growth in exports to other regions. In contrast, activity has so far been sustained in Europe and stronger than expected in North America (the destinations for two thirds of UK exports).  Euro-area GDP rose by 2.4% in the year to 1998 Q3, and US GDP increased by 4.1% in the year to 1998 Q4.  However, even in these countries, the impact of the Asian downturn and the slowdown in Middle Eastern and South American economies is beginning to be felt. Business confidence fell last year in both Europe and the United States (see Chart 2.3), and the growth rate of industrial production has also slowed (see Chart 2.4). Consequently, growth prospects for most industrialised countries have worsened. World trade forecasts have been revised downwards as a result of these developments.  Between October and December, the IMF lowered its projections for world trade growth in 1998 and 1999 by a further 0.3 and  (1) For a detailed discussion of international economic developments, see ‘The international environment’ article in the Quarterly Bulletin, February 1999, pages 20–32.

Demand and output 15 0.2 percentage points, to 3.4% and 4.4% respectively (see Chart 2.5 and Table 2.B).  These figures are well below the growth rate recorded in 1997.  However, because Asian countries account for around 27% of world trade flows, but make up less than 9% of UK exports, the slowdown in the growth rate of UK export markets is unlikely to be as sharp as the slowdown in world trade. Despite the stronger-than-expected growth in the United States, global economic conditions have continued to deteriorate.  Consequently, some of the downside risks to external demand identified in the November Inflation Report have materialised, and the MPC has revised down its expectation for UK export market growth in 1999 and 2000 to around 4%–5%.  These projections are about  2 percentage points lower than at the time of the November Report.  Moreover, given the lagged effects of sterling’s appreciation, UK exports are likely to grow less quickly than (weighted) UK export markets. Taking exports and imports together, net trade detracted from GDP growth in 1998 Q3—the sixth time this has happened in the past seven quarters.  This reflected both relative demand developments and the competitiveness effects associated with sterling’s appreciation (see Chart 2.6).  Given the slowdown in the domestic economy, demand growth in the major six overseas countries could well exceed that in the United Kingdom this year, and so start to support net trade.  But without a recovery in demand in Asia and the oil-exporting nations, it seems unlikely that the United Kingdom’s overall trade position will improve significantly. Competitiveness effects are also likely to limit the extent of any turnaround in the UK trade position.  The real sterling effective exchange rate appreciated by around one third (depending on which price deflator is used) between the beginning of 1996 and mid 1998.  This was sterling’s largest real appreciation since the early 1980s, and only a small part of it has since been unwound. Given the size of this competitiveness loss, the deterioration in the net trade position in the six quarters to 1998 Q3 was smaller than anticipated.  This was mainly because of weaker-than-expected import penetration. So it remains likely that net trade will make another negative contribution to growth this year.  The risks to this central projection are more balanced than at the time of the November Report but probably still lie marginally Source:  Datastream.

Inflation Report:  February 1999 16 on the downside.  First, import penetration may rise, partly as a result of continued weak import prices— excess world capacity for a number of commodities and traded goods is likely to persist in 1999.  Second, given the continued weakness of the Japanese economy, the emerging market nations in Asia are likely to try to expand their exports to Europe and North America, which would increase the competition faced by internationally exposed UK firms.  And third, the Brazilian authorities’ decision to float the real is likely to have further unsettled international investor sentiment. Depending on the degree of contagion, this may cause another fall in capital flows to emerging market economies, forcing these countries to adjust their current account balances by reducing imports and expanding exports.  The counterpart will be larger current account deficits (or smaller surpluses) in advanced economies, including the United Kingdom.    2.2 Domestic demand Despite slower private and government consumption growth, domestic demand increased by 0.8% in  1998 Q3, up from 0.5% in the second quarter.  This was mainly because of stronger investment (see Table 2.C). In the year to 1998 Q3, domestic demand increased by 3.7%, well above trend.  However, the level of domestic demand in the first half of 1998 was revised down by 0.5%. Consumption Household consumption growth has weakened since the November Report—the quarterly growth rate slowed to 0.3% in 1998 Q3, lowering the annual rate of increase to 2.6%.  In addition, the ONS has revised down the profile of consumption back to the start of 1997 (see Chart 2.7). Although the latest annual growth rate is close to the long-run average (see Chart 2.8), the slowdown in 1998 was sharper than the MPC had expected, given the continued strong increases in pre-tax income from employment (up by around 4% in real terms in the year to 1998 Q3) and the large rise in households’ real wealth in recent years. In Q4, retail sales volumes fell by 0.2%, suggesting that total household consumption growth may have continued to slow in the last three months of the year. Surveys by the British Retail Consortium and the CBI found that retail sales growth declined markedly towards the end of the year.

Demand and output 17 measures of consumer confidence declined further in the fourth quarter, with a particularly pronounced fall in the MORI measure (see Chart 2.9).  However, these indicators may overstate the weakness of consumption— retail sales account for less than half of total consumption, and survey measures of individuals’ confidence in the general economic situation have recovered slightly since October. The slowdown in consumption in the third quarter was accounted for by lower expenditure on both durable and non-durable goods;  spending on services remained strong.  Movements in these household expenditure components have diverged for some time, in contrast with the more synchronised nature of the slowdown prior to the 1990–92 recession.  As Chart 2.10 shows, the annual growth rate of spending on non-durable goods peaked in 1996 Q3 and has since declined steadily, whereas the deceleration in durable goods spending began only in 1998 Q1, and the growth rate of spending on services has yet to moderate. The relative weakness of spending on durable and  non-durable goods in 1998 is a puzzle.  To some extent, the former was influenced by the pattern of windfall payouts arising from the demutualisation of a number of large building societies (see Chart 2.11).  These payouts totalled around £37 billion in 1997 (equivalent to 71/2% of annual household consumption).  In August 1997, the Bank commissioned MORI to survey the beneficiaries of these demutualisations to find out what they were likely to do with their windfall payouts.(1) Using this information, the MPC estimated that domestic demand expenditures would be boosted between 1997–99 by £6–12 billion, with the most likely outcome towards the top of this range. Survey respondents also indicated that around three quarters of the windfall spending would be on durable goods and home improvements.  Although difficult to measure precisely, there is some evidence that spending on these items was boosted above trend by around £4–6 billion in the past two years.  So the sharp slowdown in the growth rate of durable goods spending in 1998 may have reflected the unwinding of this effect. However, there is little evidence that spending on  non-durable goods was boosted by windfall payouts. This suggests that the overall windfalls impact on consumption was probably less than the MPC had previously assumed. (1) See the box on page 20 of the November 1997 Report.

Inflation Report:  February 1999 18 There are a number of other possible reasons for the slowdown in household expenditure, but no single factor provides a convincing explanation.  The first possibility is that concerns about future economic prospects adversely affected consumer confidence and households’ employment expectations.  This is likely to have been associated with increased uncertainty about future income, and may have led consumers to postpone expenditures on big-ticket items, thereby raising precautionary saving.  But this explanation does not explain the weakness of spending on non-durable goods. A second possibility is that fiscal tightening embodied in recent tax changes affected consumption more than previously thought.  Some evidence to support this can be found in Government revenue figures—in the first three quarters of 1998, income taxes were more than 14% higher than in the same period in 1997.  This effect, combined with a sharp fall in net property income (which includes equity dividends), produced a marked slowdown in the growth rate of real personal disposable income (see Chart 2.12). In its previous projections for the public finances, the MPC took as its central case the effective tax rates embodied in the Chancellor’s Budget statements.  These incorporated estimates of the effects of the July 1997 Budget changes on dividend tax credits, which led to significant increases in net income tax receipts.  They also made allowance for the introduction of the new system of Self Assessment (SA) for income tax. However, since there were no changes in personal tax rates accompanying the introduction of SA, HM Treasury assumed that the new system would have only a small positive impact on the effective tax rate.  This assumption now appears to have been an underestimate. One possible explanation for this is that the increased publicity surrounding the launch of the new forms and their more comprehensive and structured layout may have increased the rate of tax compliance by more than was expected.  Unfortunately, it is still too early to draw any firm conclusions, as the seasonal pattern of tax payments will have changed as a result of the extension to the returns deadline from 1 January to 31 January. A third potential explanation for lower-than-expected household expenditure growth relates to the uncertain impact of wealth effects on consumption.  Although net wealth has increased strongly in each of the past four years, real long-term interest rates have also fallen significantly (see Section 1).  These two developments Chart 2.10 Comparison of household consumption  behaviour  Durable goods Non-durable goods Total services 1987 88 89 90 91 92 93 20 10 0 10 20 Percentage changes on a year earlier 1993 94 95 96 97 98 0 5 10 15 20 1998 slowdown Percentage changes on a year earlier + _ 1990–92 recession Chart 2.11 Windfalls and real consumption growth 0 5 10 15 25 30 35 1995 96 97 98  4  2 0 2 4 6 8 10 £ billions Durables     Percentage changes on a quarter earlier Total consumption  growth (left-hand scale) Windfall payouts  20 consumption growth  (left-hand scale) (right-hand scale) + – Chart 2.12 Real personal disposable income and  household consumption growth 1990 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Percentage changes on a year earlier RPDI Consumption + –  Demand and output 19 are likely to be linked, and may have opposing effects on consumption.  Higher wealth is beneficial for consumers, but the impact of lower real interest rates is less certain. As real interest rates fall, households may choose to reduce current consumption out of wealth, in order to maintain their desired future income and consumption— the income effect.  But the returns on new saving also decline, so individuals will tend to save less and consume more—the substitution effect—unless the reduction in the real interest rates is itself the result of a desire to  save more.  The overall impact on household expenditure will therefore depend on the balance between  the income, substitution and wealth effects.  The  worse-than-expected consumption outturn could be related to a larger-than-expected income effect. Alternatively, consumption growth may have been underestimated last year.  In the four quarters to  1998 Q3, the income-based measure of GDP (GDP(I)) increased by 2.9%, the output-based estimate (GDP(O)) rose by 2.6%, and the expenditure-based estimate (GDP(E)) grew by 2.0% (see Chart 2.13).  There is therefore a reasonable chance either that GDP(I) will be revised downwards during the annual balancing of the national accounts, or that GDP(E) will be revised upwards, or both.  Such revisions would help to explain the apparent weakness of consumption relative to the strength of income from employment.  The ONS generally considers GDP(O) to provide the best estimate of recent quarterly growth,(1) which adds weight to the idea that GDP(E) could be revised up and GDP(I) revised down. Overall, the Committee decided not to treat all of the weaker outturn for consumption as erratic.  The central projection for the level of consumption in relation to income has therefore been revised down from the November projection. Investment demand Although investment growth slowed last year, it remained relatively robust.  Whole-economy investment expenditure increased by around 1% in Q3, driven by higher business and general government investment; private sector spending on dwellings declined.  The ratio of business investment to GDP reached another post-war peak in 1998 Q3.

Most of these indicators suggest that the pace of investment growth will slow this year. Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector has fallen relative to its January 1998 peak, reducing the short-term need for new investment.  And the number of UK companies issuing profit warnings increased by more than 50% in the year to 1998 Q4 (albeit from a low base).  The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) survey similarly found that firms’ confidence in profitability remained low in both the manufacturing and service sectors in 1998 Q4 (see Chart 2.14). Because retained earnings provide the largest share of investment financing for most firms, expected lower profits will affect capital expenditure decisions in 1999. However, external financing is also important.  The real cost of borrowing faced by firms is likely to have fallen in the last few months, because of lower interest rates charged by banks, lower real bond yields and increased equity prices (see Section 1).  Overall, therefore, the real cost of capital faced by most firms seems unlikely to be a constraint on investment decisions at present.  Survey evidence supports this conclusion—in recent CBI surveys, only a small fraction of manufacturing firms reported that the cost of finance was likely to limit capital expenditure in the next twelve months. Survey evidence suggests that the overall growth rate of business investment will slow sharply this year and may well turn negative (see Charts 2.15 and 2.16). Investment intentions in the manufacturing sector remain very subdued.  They have also weakened in the service sector, though the latest BCC survey balance remained positive, indicating continued increases in capital expenditure.   Real general government investment in the second and third quarters of 1998 was 2.4% higher than in the same period a year earlier, following a fall of more than 12% in financial year 1997/98.  As the November  Pre-Budget Report indicated a 5.6% increase in the nominal capital budget for this financial year, it seems likely that the growth rate of real government investment will continue to increase in 1998 Q4 and 1999 Q1. Looking further ahead, the Government has committed itself to doubling the ratio of public sector net investment to GDP over the next three years.  So the growth rate of government capital expenditure is likely Chart 2.14 Confidence in profitability 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 1989 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 Service sector Manufacturing sector Percentage point balance + – Source:  BCC.

Millennium-related construction spending will probably also boost investment this year and may bring some expenditures forward, though it may lead to some substitution between private and public investment spending.(1) Inventory investment There is evidence that the slowdown in consumption growth took some firms by surprise, causing an involuntary accumulation of inventories.  Between the first and third quarters of 1998, manufacturing and  retail sector stock-output ratios for finished goods increased by 13/4 percentage points and 23/4 percentage points respectively.  In addition, CBI surveys have  found that the balance of manufacturing firms reporting more-than-adequate inventory levels increased in both Q3 and Q4 last year, to the highest levels since  1991.  However, there appears to be less of an  inventory overhang in the retail and wholesale sectors: the number of firms reporting to the CBI Distributive Trades Survey that stock levels increased relative  to expected sales fell back in Q4, and the January balance for this question was around its long-term average value. At the whole-economy level, inventories (excluding the alignment adjustment) increased by £0.8 billion in  1998 Q3, slightly less than in the first and second quarters (see Chart 2.17).  This pushed the  whole-economy stock-output ratio up by 0.1 percentage point.  As in the November central projection, it is likely that inventories will detract from GDP growth this year. Public sector demand Real general government consumption increased by 2.2% in the year to 1998 Q3, broadly in line with this year’s planned spending.  In assessing the outlook for the public finances, the MPC has taken as its central case the nominal government expenditure plans and effective tax rates from the pre-Budget statement published on 3 November.  The Government intends to expand current nominal spending by almost 6% in financial year 1999/2000, up from around 31/2% in the current financial year.  On the basis of the MPC’s latest inflation forecast, this implies that the growth rate of real spending will also increase. (1) For more details, see box on page 20 of the November 1998 Report.

Inflation Report:  February 1999 22 Given the larger-than-expected increase in income tax payments, the overall fiscal stance in 1998 was probably tighter than the MPC had previously assumed.  On the basis of already-announced government expenditure plans, the overall stance of fiscal policy, on a cyclically adjusted basis, is unlikely to change much between this financial year and the next. 2.3 Output According to the preliminary estimate, the quarterly growth rate of GDP (at constant market prices) decreased to 0.2% in 1998 Q4, from 0.4% in the third quarter.  This lowered the annual rate of increase to 1.6% (see Chart 2.18), in line with the MPC’s central projection at the time of the November Report. The growth rates of industrial production and service sector output still differ markedly, largely because the industrial sector is more exposed to international trade (see Chart 2.19).  Although service sector output growth slowed to 0.6% in 1998 Q4, the 2.9% annual rate of increase remains above its long-run trend.  By contrast, industrial production fell by 0.8% in the three months to November, and the average level of production in October and November was only 0.6% higher than a year earlier. In the manufacturing sector, output fell in November for the fourth month in succession, leaving it 0.2% below a year earlier.  Survey evidence continues to indicate very weak business confidence.  Although the CBI’s measure of overall optimism about the business situation improved in January, the balance remains at its lowest level since January 1991.  The balance of manufacturing firms expecting output to rise over the next four months was at broadly similar levels.  And the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) general  index fell to 42 in 1998 Q4, well below the neutral level of 50. Construction output declined by 0.6% in 1998 Q3, after a 31/2% fall in Q2.  As a consequence, the annual growth rate has slowed sharply, to 0.4%.  Furthermore, activity does not seem to have picked up much in the fourth quarter;  new construction orders in October and November were much lower than the average Q3 level. Similarly, the CIPS survey measure of construction activity averaged 45.5 in 1998 Q4, well below the balance of 51.5 in the third quarter.  In contrast, activity in the energy extraction and supply industries has been Chart 2.18 GDP growth rate(a) 1993 94 95 96 97 98 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Quarter on a year earlier Quarter on previous quarter Percentage changes Chart 2.19 Annual growth rate of GDP 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1993   94   95   96   97   98 Percentage changes on a year earlier Services GDP Manufacturing + – 0 (a) At 1995 market prices.  Demand and output 23 more buoyant—in the three months to November, output in these sectors was 4.2% higher than in the same period a year earlier. Survey evidence suggests that service sector activity will continue to slow this year.  The BCC’s measure of turnover confidence among service sector firms fell for the fifth successive quarter in 1998 Q4, as the balance of firms reporting a rise in both domestic and export orders declined.  Similarly, the CIPS indicators of service sector activity also deteriorated in the fourth quarter.  The business activity index averaged 49.1 in 1998 Q4, down from 54.7 in the third quarter, and the measure of incoming new business fell by 5 points to 47.4.  In both cases, readings below 50 indicate falling activity. 2.4 Summary Global economic conditions have continued to deteriorate since the November Inflation Report, with the impact of the sharp contraction in demand in Asia and the oil-exporting countries increasingly evident in UK export figures.  Domestically, although the slowdown in GDP growth to 0.2% in 1998 Q4 was consistent with the MPC’s central expectation at the time of the November Inflation Report, the composition of this growth differed from that anticipated.  In particular, consumption decelerated faster than expected.  And consumer confidence, business optimism and investment intentions remain weak, suggesting that activity is likely to be subdued in the first half of this year.  24 3 The labour market Chart 3.1 Old and revised headline measures of the  Average Earnings Index (suspended) 2.75 3.00 3.25 3.50 3.75 4.00 4.25 4.50 4.75 5.00 5.25 5.50 5.75 Percentage changes on a year earlier Average Earnings   Index (revised) (a) Average Earnings   Index (old) (a) 1995            96              97            98 0.00 Chart 3.2 Alternative measures of nominal earnings  growth 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 1994 95 96 97 98 Average Earnings   Index (revised,   suspended)    Reward Index Wages and salaries (a)    (National Accounts)  Percentage changes on a year earlier Employment growth has been strong and inactivity has fallen.  Unemployment has continued to edge down, but the LFS unemployment rate, which stands at 6.2%, has been relatively stable in recent months.  Recent survey evidence suggests a moderation in recruitment intentions and some alleviation of skill shortages. Last November, the ONS suspended publication of the Average Earnings Index, pending the outcome of an independent review commissioned by the Chancellor. Other evidence on nominal earnings behaviour, including settlements, analysis of the components of wage drift, and a fall in inflation expectations, appears consistent with an easing of upward pressure on nominal earnings growth. 3.1 Earnings The underlying rate of earnings growth, a key indicator of domestic inflationary pressure, remains hard to assess. The rebasing of, and revisions to, the official earnings data in October 1998 made the growth of the Average Earnings Index (AEI) volatile and difficult to reconcile with other information on pay and on the state of the labour market generally.(1) Chart 3.1 shows the reported profile of nominal earnings growth under the old and revised AEI measures.  The two series differ considerably, especially during 1997 and in 1998 Q1. Consequently, on 2 November, the ONS announced a suspension of the AEI, pending an independent review of the series commissioned by the Chancellor.  The suspension means that there is greater-than-usual uncertainty about recent earnings behaviour and its likely future path. There are a number of sources of information about earnings growth other than the AEI.  Chart 3.2 compares the revised AEI with wage and salary data from the National Accounts, and earnings growth based on the Reward Index, an independent survey covering some 860,000 employees.  Growth in National Accounts measures of wages and salaries per head was estimated at 4.4% in the year to 1998 Q3, compared with a revised Note:  The Average Earnings Index was suspended on 2 November 1998.

These estimates are partly derived from the AEI, and its suspension has meant that the ONS has based its measure of wage and salary growth on other sources.  So it is difficult to draw clear inferences from these data.  But the Reward Index also suggests that earnings growth may have slowed in recent months.   Data on wage settlements also shed light on earnings behaviour.  Basic wages account for a substantial proportion of total earnings, so there is a close relationship between wage settlements—the annual increase in the basic wage—and earnings growth.(1) The Bank’s estimate of the twelve-month employment-weighted mean wage settlement has been unchanged for the past nine months, at around 3.7%. Estimates of private and public wage settlements have also changed little since the November Report (see  Chart 3.3). On 1 February, the Government announced its decision to accept all the main pay recommendations of the pay review bodies.  For the 1999/2000 financial year, the results of the review bodies imply an average rise of 4.1% in public sector pay for the employees concerned, to be met from resources allocated under the Comprehensive Spending Review.  These pay settlements will not be staged.  Settlements were paid in two stages during the 1998/99 financial year, in April and December.  So public sector earnings growth between April and December 1999 will be temporarily higher than the average rise, to the extent of the second- stage payments. Wage drift, the difference between earnings growth and settlements, incorporates factors such as overtime payments, shift premia and bonuses.  The components of wage drift are likely to be responsive to demand conditions.  As Chart 3.4 shows, there has been a close correlation between the growth of overtime payments, as measured by the New Earnings Survey (NES), and the growth of GDP since the mid 1980s.  And the available evidence, including that from the Bank’s regional Agencies presented to the July meeting of the MPC, suggests that an important factor underpinning bonuses is corporate profits, particularly in the year preceding bonus payments.  Corporate profit growth slowed during 1998.  More recent evidence from the Agencies has Source:  Bank of England. (1) The May 1997 Report and a box on page 27 of the August 1993 Report discuss the relationship between wage settlements and earnings inflation in depth.  They note that turning-points in settlements and earnings roughly coincide and that, if anything, past experience suggests that earnings growth appears to lead settlements.  So settlements may, in part, consolidate past wage drift.  Inflation Report:  February 1999 26 pointed to lower overtime and bonus payments.  So whole-economy wage drift may have lessened in recent months. The Bank’s regional Agents reported that more companies are expecting lower settlements this year than higher.  But the outlook for growth in total earnings per head is less clear.  Some firms cite the inflation outlook and company prospects as important factors exerting downward pressure on earnings growth;  but other factors, such as the need to retain and recruit staff, have contributed to upward pressure on earnings growth, particularly in the service sector.  The effects of the Working Time Directive (WTD) and the National Minimum Wage may also be influencing the outlook for growth in earnings per head—a number of firms have not yet adjusted wages to take account of these policy changes. Wage-bargainers implicitly negotiate over expected future real wages, which depend on expected future inflation.  In particular, lower inflation expectations tend to result in lower rates of increase in nominal wages.  As noted in Section 1, financial market based measures of inflation expectations have been steadily falling since 1997.  RPI inflation expectations according to the Basix Survey have also fallen.  The survey captures the inflation expectations of a broad range of labour market participants and others, and so is perhaps more likely to shed light on the wage bargain than measures derived from financial market data.  As Table 3.A shows, one and two year ahead inflation expectations of business people, academics, trade unions and the general public mostly fell significantly between 1998 Q3 and 1998 Q4. When bargaining over real wages, employers focus on the real product wage, which compares total labour cost per employee with the post-tax price of goods and services sold.  Employees, on the other hand, care about the real consumption wage—the wage received relative to retail prices and personal taxation.  If the prices of goods and services charged by domestic producers, net  of tax, were expected to rise at a different rate from prices of goods and services bought by workers, this could drive a wedge between the growth rates of real product and consumption wages.  The wedge might increase if there were a fall in the terms of trade (the price of exports relative to imports) or if taxation increased.  This would tend to reduce labour supply relative to demand, and could raise the level of real wage pressure in the economy.

(a) Figures refer to RPI inflation, except for General public, for which the measure of inflation is not specified.  The labour market 27 Measures of real consumption and product wages would ideally incorporate expectations of the appropriate consumer and producer price indices.  But such measures are either imprecise or unavailable, and so actual price outturns must be relied upon to calculate the real wages relevant to firms and households.  Estimates based on the National Accounts suggest that real product wages grew at an annual rate of 3.4% in the year to Q3, compared with real consumption wage growth of 1.0%. This might seem to imply some upward real wage pressure.  But part of the reason why real product wages have outpaced real consumption wages lies in increased mortgage interest payments, a reduction in mortgage interest relief and increased council taxation.  This has led to relatively higher inflation in the Tax and Price Index (TPI), used to calculate the real consumption wage.  The recent cuts in interest rates are likely to reduce inflation as measured by the TPI (see Section 4), and so the wedge is likely to diminish. In judging the most likely path for nominal earnings, the MPC has taken into account the fall in inflation expectations in recent months and has lowered the inflation expectations profile used in the central projection.  And in light of the evidence from settlements, the components of drift, and alternative measures of earnings, the MPC has decided to further lower the profile for nominal earnings growth in the central projection, compared with the November Report. The MPC has taken account of the more-than-usual uncertainty surrounding the news on earnings by increasing the variance around its projections for earnings growth. 3.2 Employment and unemployment Recent employment data have been strong (see  Chart 3.5).  Employment, as measured by the LFS, rose by 98,000 (0.4%) in the three months to November.  The employment rate rose to 73.8% in October from 73.2% a year ago—its highest level since 1990.  And according to the Workforce jobs survey, employment increased by 97,000 in 1998 Q3, a rise of 0.4%, after falling in  1998 Q2.  Recent revisions to the Workforce jobs survey have increased the estimated level of employee jobs by some 450,000 since September 1997, and increased the rate of employment growth during 1997.  The two measures differ because the Workforce measure is based on a survey of the number of employee jobs, whereas the LFS measure is based on the number of people in work.  But both suggest that employment rose Chart 3.5 Employment growth 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5  0.0  0.1  0.2  0.3  0.4  0.5  0.6  0.7 1996 97 98 Workforce jobs LFS (a) + – Percentage changes on a quarter earlier (a) Note:  LFS data centred around March, June, September and December.

The MPC’s projections for inflation and output are based on the LFS measure, and are therefore unaffected by the revisions to the Workforce jobs survey.   The increase in employment has been reflected in falls in both unemployment and inactivity.  According to the most recent data, LFS unemployment fell by 26,000 in the three months to November, compared with the previous three months, and claimant unemployment fell by 14,000 in December.  Chart 3.6 shows the recent behaviour of LFS, claimant-count and short-term unemployment.  These measures all suggest that unemployment remains very low by recent historical standards—the claimant unemployment rate is at its lowest level since 1980.  But there are signs that the downward trend in unemployment has flattened.  Both the LFS unemployment rate and the claimant-count rate have edged down only slightly in recent months, and were at 6.2% in the three months to November and 4.6% in December respectively.  So the relatively stable behaviour of unemployment in the face of rising employment is largely accounted for by falling inactivity.  Inactivity fell by 36,000 in the three months to November, and by 0.9% on a year earlier.  This reflects a fall in the number of people not wanting a job, including, among other things, an increase in part-time work by women not previously counted as part of the labour force.  Overall inactivity rates have been largely unchanged since 1992.  But when allowances are made for the long-term sick, the early retired and students, inactivity rates have been falling (see Chart 3.7).  The decline in inactivity rates, adjusted for those factors, is consistent with continuing labour market tightness. Labour usage, as measured by total hours worked per week, rose by 0.1% in the three months to November, and by 0.3% on a year earlier.  Employment growth has outpaced the growth in total hours worked, so average hours worked per head have fallen.  This is consistent with both a rise in part-time work and a fall in overtime. So earnings per hour may have been growing by more than earnings per head. The continued growth of employment, in the face of slowing output growth, has meant that measured productivity growth, per hour or per head, has fallen. Whole-economy measured productivity growth rose by 1.6% in the year to 1998 Q3.  Productivity growth since 1995 has averaged around 1.6%, below its long-run Sources:  ONS and Bank of England.

The labour market 29 historical average growth rate of around 2.1% (see  Chart 3.8).  It is extremely difficult to judge the future path of productivity growth.  This is because it depends partly on how quickly firms adjust their demand for labour, and on their choice of adjusting between average hours worked and the number of people employed.  If firms regard slower economic activity as transitory, then they would be unlikely to reduce employee numbers, given hiring and firing costs.  This could lower productivity growth.  It is also possible that there has been a level shift in trend productivity.  Labour market reforms may have encouraged new workers into the workforce, or created new jobs with lower-than-average productivity.  Such factors could act to reduce the level of whole-economy measured productivity.  The MPC judges that productivity growth will slow during 1999, before picking up towards the end of the forecast period. Wage pressure is also influenced by the geographic distribution of unemployment.  If there are imbalances between the distribution of unemployed workers across different regions, such regional mismatch will affect wage pressure at any given level of aggregate unemployment.  Chart 3.9 shows how one measure of regional mismatch has changed over time;  it remains low relative to the level in the 1980s.  So lower regional mismatch could be a factor contributing to the apparent weakness of upward pressure on earnings growth, despite low aggregate unemployment. Another measure of mismatch that can be used to gauge labour market tightness is the ratio of the stock of reported vacancies to total unemployment.  This ratio can be interpreted as a comparison of unsatisfied labour demand with available supply.  The extent to which the unemployed are able to fill available vacancies is likely to affect wage pressure significantly at any given level  of unemployment.  Chart 3.10 shows that the labour market is much tighter now than in 1997 on this measure, though the most recent data suggest that the ratio may be stabilising.  Two alternative measures of the relationship between vacancies and unemployment, which stress the roles of vacancy inflows and inflows into unemployment, are also shown.  They also suggest a moderation in labour market tightness. Surveys provide a forward-looking perspective of the state of the labour market, and can shed light on  near-term employment prospects.  Recent CIPS reports pointed to sharp falls in construction and manufacturing employment, and a contraction in service sector Chart 3.8 Whole-economy measured productivity  growth(a) 1980 85 90 95  1  2  3  4  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 + _ Long-run average   (1960–98) Percentage changes on a year earlier Source:  ONS.

And as Table 3.B shows, there has been a deterioration in recruitment intentions. The Manpower survey in December indicated the lowest net balance for five years.  But when seasonal adjustment is taken into account, the balance is much closer to its average level since 1988. Chart 3.12 shows evidence from the CBI suggesting that reported shortages of both skilled and unskilled labour have decreased in recent quarters, though these have risen slightly on the latest data.  Shortages in the skilled and unskilled sectors of the labour market are often cited by employers as an important factor underpinning wage pressure.  The reduction in the percentage balance of employers reporting labour shortages, from levels reported in mid 1997, is consistent with an easing of upward pressure on pay growth. 3.3 Reforms affecting the labour market Prospects for the labour market are affected by microeconomic policies that aim to influence the demand for and supply of labour.  Measures such as the New Deal and the Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC) are designed to increase labour market participation.  A box on page 31 considers the impact of the WFTC on labour market supply, and concludes that implementation of the reform is likely to result in a moderate increase in labour market participation.  The MPC judges that it is unlikely that the WFTC will significantly influence the profile of inflation over the forecast period. However, the Working Time Directive (WTD) may result in increased effective hourly wage costs for employers, a reduction in total hours worked and lower potential output.  The cost effects of the WTD, which came into effect on 1 October 1998, chiefly consist of restrictions on hours worked, direct costs from paid holiday entitlements, fixed costs of health assessments for  night-workers, and costs of administration.(1) The Bank’s regional Agents have reported that a number of contacts expect increased wage bills, due to more generous holiday entitlements.  But how far the WTD decreases employment in equilibrium will depend on how flexibly firms are able to adjust hours worked and numbers of people employed.  In the November Report, the MPC noted that risks to inflation from the WTD warranted a small positive skew in the first year of the inflation projection.

(a) Difference between those respondents answering ‘yes’ and those  answering ‘no’ when questioned on factors likely to limit output  during next four months. (1) A box on page 30 in the November 1998 Report describes the WTD in more detail.  The labour market 31 The Working Families Tax Credit The Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC) is an in-work benefit for low-income households with dependent children, and is intended to replace the existing Family Credit scheme from October 1999.(1) Like Family Credit, the WFTC will be paid  to families where at least one adult works  more than 16 hours per week.  Under the Family Credit scheme, families earning below £79 per week received a flat-rate maximum payment.  Above that level, benefits were withdrawn by 70 pence for every £1 of additional income.  Under the WFTC, the earnings threshold has been raised to £90, and the withdrawal rate for households earning above this threshold has been reduced to  55 pence in the pound.  Recipients of the  WFTC are also entitled to help with 70% of childcare costs, subject to a ceiling determined by the number of children in the household. The WFTC has the potential to increase participation in the labour market and hence the supply of labour available to meet labour demand. The WFTC is likely to have different effects  on the labour supplied by different groups of people.  For some individuals, such as lone parents, the WFTC should raise the incentives  to work, because of the increase in the threshold, the reduction of the withdrawal rate and the fall in childcare costs.  For other people, such as partners of WFTC recipients,  the incentive to work may be reduced.  This  is because the WFTC reforms could entail  an increase in family income for a partner  when they do not work, increasing their desire to move out of work.  This effect may be counteracted by the childcare credit, as both partners in a couple must be working to  receive help with childcare costs.  But since  a significant amount of childcare is informal, introduction of the WFTC may lead to  some substitution from informal to formal childcare. The impact of the WFTC on the number of hours worked is also likely to vary between groups.  When in-work benefits are withdrawn as earnings rise, the incentive to work an extra hour is reduced.  For some households, this disincentive will lessen with the WFTC, because of the raising of the earnings level at which withdrawal starts, and the lowering of the withdrawal rate.  But there will be some people who will be better off overall by receiving WFTC, but who do not currently receive Family Credit.  This group will face the additional 55% withdrawal rate of WFTC on top of the marginal withdrawal rate, produced by income tax and National Insurance, that they already faced. This may cause them to reduce labour supply. For the population as a whole, a reliable guide to the impact of the WFTC can only be provided by a simulation based on a representative sample of households.  Independent research(2) by the Institute of Fiscal Studies has attempted to quantify the labour market impact of the WFTC, using its tax and benefit simulation model (TAXBEN) and data from the Family Resources Survey.  They divide recipients into two groups—lone parents, and couples with children.  Their analysis indicates that the WFTC is likely to increase the participation of lone parents in the labour market.  Among couples, the effects on male participation are estimated to be small, while there is a moderate decrease in labour supplied by women as a result of the incentives to move out of work highlighted above.  Their provisional findings suggest that the increase in total economy-wide participation, which depends on how far the childcare subsidy is taken up, would lie between 10,000 and 45,000 workers, with a point estimate of 30,000 in the event of a 100% take-up of childcare subsidy.  In the MPC’s judgment, numbers of this magnitude are unlikely materially to affect whole-economy labour supply.  So it is unlikely that the WFTC will significantly influence the profile of inflation over the forecast period. (1) For a detailed discussion of the policy, see ‘The Modernisation of Britain’s Tax & Benefits System—the Working Families Tax Credit and Work Incentives’, Treasury Budget Paper No 3, 1998. (2) The Bank of England has contributed towards the cost of this study.  Inflation Report:  February 1999 32 MPC has now incorporated an effect from the WTD into its central projection, rather than as a risk, but it remains small. 3.4 Summary The labour market appears tight by recent historical standards.  Employment growth continues to be strong, leading to falls in both unemployment and inactivity. The LFS unemployment rate stood at 6.2% in the three months to November, slightly lower than in the preceding three months.  But recent survey evidence points to a moderation in recruitment intentions and some alleviation of skill shortages.  So a turning-point in labour market conditions may have been reached. The ONS has suspended publication of the Average Earnings Index, pending the outcome of an independent review commissioned by the Chancellor.  Inflation expectations have fallen significantly further in recent months.  This, together with the available evidence on nominal wage behaviour, notably from settlements and analysis of the components of wage drift, appears consistent with an easing of upward pressure on earnings growth over the forecast period.  33 Costs and prices 4 Chart 4.1 Bank’s commodity price index(a)  2.5  5.0  7.5 10.0 12.5 15.0 17.5   0.0   2.5   5.0   7.5  10.0  12.5 1992 93 94 95 96 97 98 + _ Oil-inclusive Non-oil Percentage changes on a year earlier Chart 4.2 Forward curves of Brent crude dollar  oil prices(a) 10.0 12.5 15.0 17.5 20.0 22.5 Oct.

World prices of commodities, which have fallen further since the November Report, have resulted in falling producer prices in the major economies.  UK import prices have continued to decline, and in December, manufacturing output prices were flat or lower than a year earlier.  Output price inflation in the service sector has been higher than in manufacturing, but evidence from the CIPS survey suggests that cost pressures may be easing there.  The limited information available, from the National Accounts and surveys, points to a moderation in nominal unit labour cost growth since the middle of 1998. 4.1 Raw materials and commodity prices World prices of raw materials and commodities have fallen sharply over the past three years.  The Economist dollar index of world non-oil commodity prices has fallen by more than 20%, and the dollar oil price has fallen by almost 40%.  The Bank’s commodity price indices, which are weighted by UK demand, have also declined sharply over the past three years—excluding oil prices, they have fallen by 18%, and including oil, by 24% (see Chart 4.1). Brent crude oil prices fell from a peak of $24 per barrel in January 1997 to a trough of just below $10 in December 1998, and remained low at $10–12 throughout January (oil prices were lower only in July 1986 and prior to that 1973).  The decline reflects the contraction of Asian demand and expectations of subdued world demand in 1999.  The forward prices for Brent crude, which were revised down throughout 1998 as spot prices fell, suggest that prices will remain broadly flat, far below their 1997 levels (see Chart 4.2).  Oil consumption per unit of output by OECD countries has fallen by around 40% since the 1970s, so the impact of lower oil prices on those countries may be less marked than in the past.  The United Kingdom is a small net exporter of oil, so lower prices may reduce income and therefore restrain demand, though net trade in oil now accounts for a much lower proportion of GDP than it did in the early or mid 1980s.  There may also be indirect effects on UK demand and prices, resulting from a shift in the (a) Monthly average of prices of primary commodities weighted by their  importance in UK demand.

The implications for UK net trade are discussed in Section 2. Non-oil commodity prices have been depressed by weaker world demand.  Wholesale food prices in the United Kingdom—which account for just under half of the Bank’s non-oil commodity price index—have been further reduced by the strength of sterling against other European currencies over the past two and a half years. The introduction of the euro has changed the way that intervention prices are calculated under the Common Agricultural Policy.  Since 1 January 1999, intervention prices have been calculated in euros and translated into sterling using the market exchange rate against the euro rather than the green pound, which has been abolished. Intervention prices were little changed in January, as sterling traded in a narrow range against the euro.  As noted in previous Reports, some intervention prices may fall from 2000, if the European Commission’s Agenda 2000 proposals are accepted. The MPC’s central projection assumes that world commodity prices in dollars will be broadly flat in 1999, before rising in 2000.  Lower oil prices are assumed to have similar effects on the UK economy to lower prices for other commodities. 4.2 Import prices and the exchange rate Sterling prices of imported goods fell by 6% in the twelve months to November, and by 13% since August 1996, when sterling began to appreciate.  The fall in import prices has been less marked than sterling’s appreciation since 1996, though the decline in sterling’s ERI and in the broad ERI since April 1998 has narrowed the gap (see Chart 4.3).  Import prices have remained high relative to the average export prices of the United Kingdom’s major trading partners, suggesting that suppliers may have used sterling’s appreciation to widen their margins on UK sales.  The response of import prices may also have been tempered if overseas exporters to the United Kingdom thought that sterling’s appreciation was temporary.  That may also have an effect on the extent and timing of the response to the recent depreciation of sterling.   As discussed in Section 2, prospects for global growth and trade have deteriorated further since the November Report, and the outlook for world inflation remains Note:  The ERI is measured against 20 other industrialised countries.  The  broad ERI is measured against 49 other countries. (a) A fall indicates an appreciation.

The MPC has revised down its projection for import prices in 1999, reflecting weaker prospects for world growth and lower world inflation. 4.3 Costs and prices in the service sector There are some signs that cost pressures in the service sector are easing.  The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) measure of the cost of all inputs fell from a peak of 58.8 in 1998 Q2 to 54 in Q4.  Although above the neutral level of 50, which indicates no change in costs compared with the previous period, that was below the average for the series, which began in  July 1996. A measure of corporate services output inflation is being developed by the ONS.  At present, it is experimental and only twelve series are published (a further 36 series will eventually be included in an aggregate index).  Of the twelve published series, seven pointed to lower inflation in 1998 Q3 than in Q2, four pointed to higher inflation, and one showed no change.  Survey data suggest that services output price inflation has eased since then.  The CIPS survey index for average prices charged fell from 52.2 in 1998 Q1 to 47.8 in Q4;  as that is below the neutral level of 50, it would be consistent with a fall in prices between the third and fourth quarters.  And the index remained below 50 in January.  But the BCC survey pointed to higher service sector inflation in 1998 Q4 than in Q3, because of the cost of overheads and pay settlements. 4.4 Costs and prices in manufacturing Input prices continued to fall throughout the second half of 1998, and were 9.3% lower than a year earlier in  1998 Q4;  excluding food, drink, tobacco and petroleum, prices were around 5% lower.  Output prices have held up relative to input prices (see Chart 4.4).  That probably reflects past increases in the cost of labour or bought-in services, which together account for around half of manufacturers’ total costs.  But in 1998 Q4, all measures of output prices were flat or lower than a year earlier.(1) Both the BCC and CBI survey measures pointed to a further decline in UK output prices.  The latest available data for 1998 for other G7 countries and the euro area as a whole also show producer prices falling (see Chart 4.5), which suggests further downward pressure on UK import (a) Output prices excluding excise duties (PPIY). (1) The ONS is to improve the Producer Price Index by changing the sample and raising the representation of small firms in the index.  Significant changes are not expected until February 2001.

Inflation Report:  February 1999 36 prices as recent reductions in global producer prices are passed on. 4.5 Retail prices Annual inflation in retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments (RPIX) was close to target at 2.6% in December, following four months when inflation had been exactly at the target rate of 2.5%.  RPIY, which also excludes indirect and local authorities’ taxes, rose to 2.0%.  The headline RPI inflation rate fell to 2.8% (see Chart 4.6).   The small increase in RPIX inflation in December was the result of a sharp rise in seasonal food prices, caused by bad weather, and a bigger increase in household goods prices than the previous December—prices often rise in this sector in advance of discounting for the January ‘sales’.  Neither of these upward influences on inflation is expected to persist. The average RPIX inflation rate was 2.6% in 1998, and it has been between 2% and 3% in every year since 1993.  The November Report noted that RPIX inflation has been very stable recently.  It is also useful to look at the distribution of inflation rates within RPIX, to see whether stable inflation rates have been accompanied by smaller relative price changes.  Chart 4.7 shows the distribution of weighted twelve-month price changes in the 77 categories of goods and services included in RPIX inflation.  As well as moving down with lower inflation since the late 1980s, the distribution of prices has also narrowed slightly, which means that the variance of relative price movements has been a little lower.  Price cuts have become more common:  in 1998, 20% of prices in RPIX were lower than a year earlier, compared with around 6% in 1988–92.  This is particularly true for goods prices—27% fell in 1998, compared with 14% of services prices. Services price inflation has been above that of goods since December 1996.  The gap between RPIX services and goods price inflation narrowed a little in December; services price inflation remained at 3.5%, whereas that for goods rose to 1.4%.  But the gap between services and goods price inflation was even wider when measured by RPIY, as petrol prices excluding excise duties were lower than a year earlier. The current size of the gap is partly due to goods prices having a higher import content than services, so an Chart 4.6 Inflation(a) 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 1995 96 97 98 Percentage changes on a year earlier RPI RPIY RPIX RPIX = Retail price index excluding mortgage interest payments.

Costs and prices 37 exchange rate appreciation lowers goods prices relative to services.  But that difference should diminish once an exchange rate appreciation ends or reverses.  However, since 1977 there have only been short periods when UK services price inflation has not exceeded that of goods, and the empirical evidence is similar for other countries. That is likely to be the result of lower productivity growth in the service sector than for goods, though it is difficult to measure the quality, and therefore productivity growth, of services precisely.(1)  The lower import content of services than goods means that the inflation rate of services has been closer to domestically generated inflation (DGI) than that of goods in the past two years.  DGI inflation measures have fallen back in recent quarters (see Chart 4.8).  One measure of DGI, the GDP deflator excluding export price inflation, fell to 2.8% in Q3.  A second measure, RPIX inflation excluding import prices, fell below 5% for the first time since 1997.  A third measure, an estimate of unit labour cost growth, is derived from data based on the AEI, which has been suspended (see Section 3).  Unit labour cost estimates are therefore less firmly based than usual. Upward revisions to employment, and small revisions to wages and salaries, mean that labour costs per unit of output appear to have been higher in 1997 than previously thought.  But recent estimates suggest that wage pressures eased in 1998 Q3:  annual unit wage cost growth fell from 3.5% in Q2 to 2.8% in Q3. Since 1997, headline RPI inflation has been above RPIX inflation, because of the interest rate rises between  May 1997 and June 1998 (see Chart 4.9).  Between October 1998 and February 1999, the MPC reduced the official repo rate by 2%.  Headline RPI inflation should, therefore, fall below RPIX inflation in the next few months as the reduction in official interest rates feeds through to lower mortgage rates, and as the April 1998 reduction in Mortgage Interest Relief at Source (MIRAS), falls out of the annual comparison.  4.6 Other price indices Other measures of retail price inflation remained flat or fell slightly during 1998 Q4.  Inflation in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) rose by 1.5% in the twelve months to December, somewhat higher than the averages for the euro area and the European Union as a Chart 4.8 Measures of domestically generated  inflation(a) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 1993 94 95 96 97 98 RPIX excluding import prices GDP deflator excluding   export prices (b)  Percentage changes on a year earlier (a) Unit labour costs measure suspended on account of Average Earnings Index.

The GDP deflator measure of whole-economy inflation fell to 1.8% in 1998 Q3. The ONS has recently constructed HICP inflation rates for the United Kingdom over a long period.(1) HICP inflation rates back to 1989 were calculated using individual price quotes (see Chart 4.10).  HICP inflation was above that of RPIX for the twelve months from April 1991.  This was a result of a cut in local authorities’ taxes, partly financed by an increase in VAT—local authorities’ taxes are included in RPIX but are excluded from the HICP, whereas VAT is included in both indices.  But on average, HICP inflation has been 0.5 percentage points lower than RPIX inflation since 1989.  HICP inflation rates were estimated for 1975–88 assuming that the use of the geometric mean (see below) has a downward effect on the inflation rate of  0.25 percentage points.  Between 1976 and 1988, HICP inflation was on average 0.5 percentage points lower than RPIX inflation. The gap between RPIX and HICP inflation is accounted for by differences in coverage and the use of different methods of combining price quotes at the lowest level. Using the geometric (instead of the arithmetic) mean in the HICP results in a lower inflation rate than the methods used in RPIX.  That is because when relative prices change, the geometric mean method in effect increases the weight on goods whose relative price has fallen (it is as though consumers are assumed to switch spending towards cheaper substitutes), whereas the arithmetic mean method has fixed weights.  This has accounted for 0.2–0.5 percentage points of the difference between the two inflation rates since 1989 (see Table 4.A).  Coverage differences have had varying effects across years.  HICP inflation is currently  1.1 percentage points below RPIX inflation.  The 0.6 percentage points of the current difference that is not explained by the use of the geometric mean reflects the exclusion from the HICP of local authorities’ taxes and owner-occupiers’ housing costs (housing depreciation is included in RPIX). 4.7 Summary Inflation was exactly on target between August and November 1998, and remained close to target in December.

HICP price indices are still under development.  From December 1999, the coverage of goods and services included in the HICP will be extended, and the population coverage will be expanded to include foreign nationals’ spending in the United Kingdom.  Costs and prices 39 been reflected in subdued manufacturing output prices. Surveys and falling producer prices overseas suggest that this weakness is set to continue.  Service sector output price inflation also appears to have moderated during the second half of 1998.   Domestically generated inflation has been significantly higher than imported inflation in the past two years. Similarly, services price inflation has been higher than that for goods.  Over the forecast period, weaker domestic demand and the lagged effects of sterling’s recent and expected depreciation should gradually narrow the gap between domestically generated and imported inflation.  The MPC’s central projection assumes that import prices rise more slowly throughout 1999 than was expected at the time of the November Report.  40 5 Monetary policy since the November Report This section summarises the economic developments and monetary policy decisions taken by the MPC since the November Report.  The minutes of the November, December and January meetings are attached as an Annex to this Report.  The Bank of England’s official dealing rate—the repo rate—was reduced from 6.75% in November to 6.25% in December, 6.0% in January, and 5.5% in February. At the time of the November Report, the central projection was for RPIX inflation to rise slightly above target over the following twelve months, before returning to around 2.5% at the two-year forecast horizon.  The small rise in projected inflation reflected higher earnings growth, including the effects of the National Minimum Wage.  Risks to the inflation outlook were thought to be symmetric—downside risks from weaker growth were expected to be balanced by upside risks from past strong money growth and from the possibility of a more rapid fall in the exchange rate. At its meeting on 9–10 December, the Committee noted that the prospects for global activity and prices had deteriorated further over the month.  Business confidence in the major economies had weakened and commodity prices, particularly oil, had fallen further. Trade data had suggested that the effects of slower world demand were now emerging, in addition to the impact of sterling’s appreciation.  There had been an easing of monetary policy in the United States and the euro area. The main domestic news concerned consumption, though other indicators of domestic activity were also showing signs of softening.  In particular, pressures in the labour market appeared to have eased.  However, aggregate M4 growth had continued at annual rates of more than 9%, and asset prices remained firm. Many of the Committee’s concerns related to the prospects for consumption and confidence. Consumption growth in Q3 had been below the November central projection, and retail sales growth pointed to further weakening in Q4.  Various reasons for the slower-than-expected household spending were suggested, and are detailed in the Annex.  These included the possibility that the consumption effects of  Monetary policy since the November Report 41 windfall payouts in 1997 had been more bunched than expected;  that consumers were more worried by the outlook for employment and were saving more;  and that consumers had not reacted to increases in wealth in the same way as in the past.  But the Committee judged that none of the explanations on its own was sufficient to explain the slowdown in consumption. In assessing the inflation outlook, the Committee noted that the mean of the two year ahead RPIX projection had already been below 2.5% in November.  The weaker global and domestic situations suggested that the balance of risks to UK activity was now even further on the downside, so the expected inflation rate two years ahead had fallen since the November Report.   The Committee therefore agreed that there was a clear case for a further cut in interest rates during the month. It considered whether it was helpful to judge the appropriate level of nominal interest rates by reference to a ‘neutral’ level that provided neither restraint nor stimulus to the economy.  Proxies for the neutral interest rate could, in principle, be determined by combining short-term inflation expectations with an estimate of the short-run real interest rate.  But in practice, measurement of the neutral nominal rate was difficult and imprecise; estimates lay between 4.5% and 6.5%.  Though some Committee members found the concept useful, others judged that the uncertainty surrounding its level was too large for it to be a practical guide to policy.  The widely held view was that an immediate cut in interest rates of 50 basis points was justified by the news over the month. Accordingly, the Committee voted to reduce the repo rate from 6.75% to 6.25%. At its meeting on 6–7 January, the Committee again considered the prospects for global activity and prices. Views varied on whether there had been a further deterioration in external demand over the month, or whether international developments had principally reflected the continuing pass-through and unwinding of previous negative shocks.  However, commodity prices had remained weak—the fall in world oil prices to around $10 per barrel prior to the December meeting had largely persisted, and non-oil commodity prices had increased only slightly in November.  Overall, the Committee felt that the prospects for global activity and prices had changed little since December, and that the risks to both inflation and activity remained clearly on the downside.  Inflation Report:  February 1999 42 The main domestic news on activity had been the small downward revision to the level of GDP and the change in the composition of growth.  Consumption had been revised down, and the contribution from net trade and inventory accumulation had been revised up.  The lower estimate for the level of GDP suggested that pressure on capacity was likely to have been less than previously thought.  The news from retail sales had been mixed, while monetary growth and world stock markets pointed to a stronger outlook for activity.  The Committee concluded that recent indicators suggested that GDP growth in 1998 Q4 would turn out broadly as expected at the time of the November Report. Given this picture for activity, nominal price and cost developments continued to be more benign than expected at the time of the November projections and, on the view of some Committee members, than expected in December.  Producer input prices had continued to fall, and wage settlements had been flat for many months.  Depending on wage drift developments, this suggested a somewhat lower path for earnings growth than previously expected. In its discussion of the immediate policy decision, the Committee largely focused on two considerations.  First, the adjustment in the world economy was likely to prove more prolonged than previously assumed, so there was less need for policy to put downward pressure on domestically generated inflation.  Second, revisions to the expenditure composition of domestic demand, together with the potential easing in the labour market and the apparent moderation of inflation expectations, suggested weaker prospects for inflation.  Against this background, the Committee voted to cut the Bank’s repo rate by 0.25% to 6.0%. At its meeting on 3–4 February, the Committee voted to reduce the repo rate by 0.5% to 5.5%.  43 Prospects for inflation 6 6.1 The inflation projection assumptions This Report, which the MPC approved on 5 February, contains the Committee’s assessment of developments in inflation in the economy since November, and prospects for the medium term.  Charts 6.1 and 6.2 show projections for GDP growth and RPIX inflation up to two years ahead, and the uncertainties surrounding them. The projections assume that the Bank’s repo interest rate will remain unchanged at 5.5% during the next two years, and are conditioned on the assumptions described below. There has been a further downturn in the prospects for world demand and inflation since the November Report. The outlook for Japan appears even weaker than three months ago, and prospects for growth in the euro area have deteriorated.  This has to some extent been offset by stronger demand in the United States.  Outside the major industrial economies, prospects for some emerging market economies look weaker, particularly following the floating of the Brazilian real.  The Committee now assumes that UK-weighted export markets will grow by 4%–5% in both 1999 and 2000, well below the average over the 1990s.  As in recent projections, the slowdown in the growth rate of  UK-weighted export markets is likely to be less severe than the slowdown in total world trade, because of the compression of intra-Asian trade.  But the UK share of its export markets is likely to continue to fall during the next two years, because of the lagged effects of the past appreciation of sterling. Moreover, although the MPC considers the risks to output to be broadly balanced in the first year of the projection, there is a downside risk to UK demand from lower world growth in the second year of the projection. In particular, the slowdown in activity in industrial countries could prove protracted and hence lead to weaker UK net trade.  One particular risk is that US domestic demand growth, having been very strong, will slow more sharply than assumed in the central case, perhaps following a fall in stock-market values. The weaker outlook for world activity has also led to the prospect of a softer profile for world inflation in the  Inflation Report:  February 1999 44 short run, and hence for lower imported inflation, than expected at the time of the November Inflation Report. In particular, commodity prices remain low.  Given the exchange rate assumptions outlined below, the central projection is for the fall in import prices in sterling terms to end.  There is a risk that world export prices could be weaker than in the central projection, which would lead to lower UK inflation. The sterling exchange rate, as measured by the effective exchange rate index, averaged 100.1 in the 15 working days up to and including 3 February.  This is the  starting-point for the exchange rate profile assumed in the projection.  It compares with an average of 100.0 at the time of the November Report and an implied level of 99.7 for February then.  So the starting-point for the exchange rate now is a little higher than in the November projection. In judging the path for sterling, conditional on unchanged UK nominal interest rates, the MPC has taken into account both interest rate differentials and risk considerations.  In the central projection, the sterling ERI declines to 97.6 by the end of the two-year forecast period, and this implies bilateral sterling exchange rates of about $1.67 and  0.72 (equivalent to DM 2.71).  By itself, the introduction of the euro has no direct implications for UK monetary policy, at least in the near term.  In the MPC’s view, there is still a somewhat greater risk of a fall in the sterling ERI than a rise, relative to the central projection.  On average, the sterling ERI is expected to decline more steeply than in the central projection, reaching a level just above 96 in two years’ time.  The November Inflation Report projections allowed for  a small risk of a marked reduction in the supply of  credit to UK companies and households, following the global financial turbulence earlier in the year.  That  risk did not materialise, and the MPC has decided to remove this small downside risk to demand and  inflation. The plans announced in the autumn pre-Budget statement made by the Chancellor on 3 November were incorporated into the November projections, and these figures remain the basis for the February projections. Given the Government’s announced plans and the Committee’s latest central projection for inflation, the likely profiles for real government consumption and investment are similar to those assumed by the Committee in November.    Prospects for inflation 45 Previous projections have already incorporated assumptions about the effects of the National Minimum Wage, the New Deal and the Working Time Directive (WTD).  There was a small upside risk to inflation from the introduction of the WTD in the November projection.  Further analysis has not altered the MPC’s view that the effects of the WTD on inflation and output are likely to be relatively small, but the Committee decided to allow for an effect in the central projection. Preliminary results of independent research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies on the impact of the Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC) have also been made available to the Committee (see page 31).  The Committee judges that the reduction in inflation up to the forecast horizon following the introduction of the WFTC is likely to be very small, and decided not to make any allowance in its projections.  There is no change to the assumptions made in recent Reports on the effects of other labour market reform measures. 6.2 The medium-term inflation projection The preliminary estimate of output growth in the fourth quarter of 1998 released in January was close to the central projection made in the November Report, and hence by itself contained little news.  However, the previous month’s National Accounts release of data for Q3 had contained some revisions to the level of output, and to the composition of demand growth in recent quarters.  The level of output was around 0.2% lower than previously thought, but this revision was not large enough to warrant a significant change of view on the extent of inflationary pressures in the economy.  Final domestic demand growth (ie excluding inventory accumulation) was a little lower than expected at the time of the November Report, largely because of weaker consumption growth.   The Committee discussed various possible explanations for lower-than-expected consumption growth in Q3 and in preceding quarters that had been revised, and concluded that none was compelling on its own.  One possibility was that consumption had recently been erratically low, and would at some stage recover to its equilibrium level in relation to labour income, wealth and interest rates.  There was also a chance that the data would be revised.  Other possibilities were that the windfall effect from demutualisations or the wealth effect from rising equity prices had been smaller than assumed in previous projections.  The Committee decided not to treat all of the weaker outturn for  Inflation Report:  February 1999 46 consumption as erratic, and so the central projection is for a slightly lower level of consumption in relation to income through the forecast period than assumed three months ago. Investment in Q3 was a little stronger than expected at the time of the November Report, and was also revised upwards in earlier quarters.  But investment intentions in manufacturing remain very subdued, and have also weakened in the service sector.  The Committee reduced its central projections for investment growth markedly at the time of the August 1998 Report, partly on account of the survey evidence, and it judges that no further adjustment is warranted.  The central projection remains that the growth rate of business investment is likely to slow sharply this year and may well turn negative. The contribution to GDP growth in the third quarter from the change in inventories was stronger than expected at the time of the previous Report, but revisions to earlier quarters lowered the measured stock-output ratio.  It remains likely that a reduction in inventories will significantly detract from GDP growth in the period ahead.   The central projection is that net exports are likely to depress GDP growth in both 1999 and 2000.  However, the weaker outlook for world demand and UK exports is largely offset by weaker UK domestic demand and imports, so the deterioration in net trade is little changed relative to the November Report projections. Although the outturn for Q4 GDP was in line with the November central projection, the MPC judges that the prospects for activity in the period immediately ahead have deteriorated somewhat.  There are two main reasons:  first, a downward revision to the projection for domestic demand, particularly consumption, linked to the outlook for the labour market discussed below;  and second, a further deterioration in the prospects for world demand and UK exports.   The central projection is for the four-quarter growth rate of GDP at constant market prices to slow to between 1/2% and 1% during this year, before recovering to around trend by the middle of 2000 as domestic demand picks up (see Chart 6.1).(1) The trough in the central projection for growth is a little deeper than at the time of the November Report.  Quarterly growth is expected to be close to zero in the first half of this year.  The central (1) Also shown as Chart 1 in the Overview.

These surveys, although much weaker than their past historical averages, also point to broadly flat GDP at the start of 1999. As well as some deterioration in the immediate prospects for output, there has also been news over the past three months about nominal variables.  Broad money growth has slowed, consistent with a gradual slowing of demand.  Inflation expectations have fallen on a number of measures over the past quarter.  This is likely to lead to lower wage and price-setting.  In addition, the reduction in interest rates in recent months means that headline RPI inflation is likely to fall below RPIX inflation for a period, which may further moderate pressure on pay settlements. The suspension of the Average Earnings Index last November, pending the outcome of the independent review, makes analysis of the labour market more than usually uncertain, and this is reflected in the greater width of the inflation projection fan chart than would otherwise be the case.  Given the further tightening of the labour market in the past year, settlements might have been expected to rise over the past few months.  In fact, settlements were flat on the twelve-month employment-weighted measure for the past nine months. It also seems probable that wage drift is now contributing less to the growth of earnings per head than it has been, especially given the recent fall in average hours worked per employee and hence the likely reduction in overtime pay.  The recent survey by the Bank’s regional Agents for the February MPC showed more companies expecting lower settlements this year than higher, though the same survey showed a less clear picture for growth in earnings per head.  Although the recent public sector pay settlements were higher than a year ago, and both the Working Time Directive and the National Minimum Wage are likely to increase labour costs to some degree, upward pressure on overall pay growth appears to be easing.  This has led the Committee to lower both the starting-point and central projection for nominal earnings growth compared with the November Report. LFS unemployment has declined slightly over the past three months, claimant-count unemployment is at its lowest level since 1980, and employment has continued to rise.  Overall, the data suggest that the labour market has reached a turning-point.  The Committee’s central  Inflation Report:  February 1999 48 projection is that employment may fall for a time, reflecting a period of output growth below trend.  This will ease pressures on pay.  The LFS measure of inactivity has been rising, but this reflects a long-term structural increase due to such factors as the rise in the number of long-term sick.  After adjusting for these, the inactivity rate is likely to be cyclical and to rise a little as the economy slows.  This matters for the projection because the inactive are assumed to exert much less downward pressure on the level of real earnings than the unemployed. Over the past three years, as employment has grown strongly, measured productivity growth has been 11/2%, somewhat below trend.  Whole-economy productivity growth is judged likely to remain below its long-run average in 1999, before increasing towards the end of the forecast period.  There are several possible explanations for weaker-than-average productivity growth over the recent past.  First, productivity may have been mismeasured.  Second, the strength of employment growth as activity slowed has been surprising.  This may reflect a timing effect as firms expect the slowdown in demand to be temporary, in which case measured productivity may eventually return to its long-run trend level.  A third possibility is that the rate of increase in productivity has been temporarily weaker than its average historical rate because of structural changes in the labour market.  For example, it is possible that labour market reforms have encouraged new workers into the labour market, or created new jobs, with lower-than-average productivity, which reduced the measured level of productivity growth while the adjustment was taking place.  Thereafter, productivity growth would be expected to return to its long-run average.  These alternative possibilities have different implications for price-cost margins.  A rapid rise in employment consistent with firms assuming that weakening demand was temporary would suggest that productive capacity is greater than previously thought, and hence put downward pressure on margins.  But a shift in the level of average productivity would imply lower capacity and less downward pressure on margins. The central projection attaches some weight to all of these explanations, and taken together they raise the projection for inflation compared with the productivity assumption in the November Report.  But there is a great deal of uncertainty, and on balance there is a small downside risk to inflation from these factors relative to the central projection.  The sensitivities are such that if one took the view that there had not been any shift in   Prospects for inflation 49 the level of average productivity, then the central projection for inflation would be about 0.2 percentage points lower. Survey measures of capacity utilisation from the BCC and CBI are broadly consistent with estimates based on an examination of output relative to inputs of capital and labour.  A fall in capacity utilisation was already under way at the end of 1998, which does not seem surprising given the slowing of output growth compared with its trend.  The prospective fall from peak to trough is likely to be much smaller than in the early 1990s.  This partly reflects the starting-point:  capacity utilisation measures were much higher in the late 1980s than in the late 1990s.  The effect of capacity utilisation on prices (relative to weighted costs) seems to be pro-cyclical. But prices respond to capacity utilisation with a lag, so the central projection is that the reduction in utilisation rates will continue to put downward pressure on inflation as growth picks up. The MPC’s projection for the twelve-month RPIX inflation rate—assuming that nominal interest rates are constant at 5.5%—is shown in Chart 6.2.(1) The November projection, which corresponds to a 1.25% higher interest rate assumption, is shown alongside it (Chart 6.3).  The most likely path is for RPIX inflation to stay close to the 21/2% target for the next two years. The profile for inflation through this year is a little lower than in the November projection for 1999, but is broadly the same as in November by the end of the forecast period.  This reflects a number of factors.  The downturn in prospects for world activity implies a weaker outlook for both UK exports and world prices, and so lower UK inflation.  And the starting-point and profile for the sterling effective exchange rate is a little higher than in November.  There is the also a prospect of slower growth of consumption and hence domestic demand. The starting-point and profile for earnings growth are lower in the current projection.  But some factors have raised the central projection since November.  Interest rates were reduced by 0.5% in December, 0.25% in January and 0.5% in February. The balance of risks to output is on the downside throughout the forecast period, as at the time of the November Report.  Overall, the risks to inflation are broadly balanced in the first year of the projection, but are slightly on the downside through the second year of (1) Also shown as Chart 2 in the Overview.

Table 6.A shows the MPC’s assessment of the probabilities of various outturns for inflation and output growth. The market expectation of the likely path of interest rates has fallen since the November Report.  On  3 February, implied interest rates on short-sterling contracts suggested that the market expectation was for a fall in official interest rates to around 5% by the end of 1999.  The MPC’s projections for inflation and output growth under the assumption that official interest rates follow market expectations differ somewhat from those in the central projection (see Charts 6.6 and 6.7).  The path of interest rates is below the constant interest rate assumption, implying slightly faster growth and consequently higher inflation than in the central projection which, at the two-year horizon, is above the target.

These uncertainties are illustrated explicitly in the Inflation Report fan charts for growth and RPIX inflation.  But how should the Inflation Report fan charts be interpreted? The fan chart probability distributions contain more information than a simple point forecast.  The width of the fans measures the overall degree of uncertainty, which may change from quarter to quarter as the assessment of risks evolves.  How far the bands stretch out on one side of the central band compared with the other—the skew of the distribution—is determined by an assessment of the balance of risks.  Again, this can change from quarter to quarter. Fan charts are shaded rather like a contour map in the following sense.  Pick a particular date in the forecast period.  The fan chart at that point shows the MPC’s judgment of the probability of various ranges of outcomes.  As with a contour map, it represents a simplified version of a cross-section of a hill.  Figure 1 illustrates a ‘probability hill’. The probability of any specific inflation number occurring is close to zero, so it is better to think of the probability that inflation will fall within a particular range.  That is what the fan chart illustrates.  The width of the band shows a range.  The central band (around the peak in Figure 1) defines the range within which there is a 10% chance of inflation occurring. This area is shaded deep red.  Each successive pair of lighter-shaded red bands is drawn in a similar way by adding another 10% of the probability and moving further down the probability hill.  Taken together, the shaded areas contains 90% of the probability distribution. The same method is used for each point in time over the forecast period.  The fan chart is drawn by joining up the individual probability distributions through time.  As with a contour map, the darkest band corresponds to the highest part of the probability hill. It is the narrowest range of outcomes for inflation that contains 10% of the probability.  In other words, the likely outcomes are clustered round the central point. Uncertainty increases as the forecast period moves forward, so the width of the bands increases. Some of the risks that the MPC discusses when making the Inflation Report projection will materialise, and others will not.  So the economy is unlikely to move along the band containing the central projection throughout the forecast period, or any other particular shaded band in the fan chart.  It is, for example, quite possible that inflation will be above the central projection in the first year, but will fall below the central projection in the second year (or vice versa).   There are numerous different possible paths for the economy, and the fan chart tries to capture these outcomes in a single chart.  Taking an average of all these possibilities gives the mean of the distribution. If the distribution of outcomes is symmetric, then the modal (ie most likely) outcome will equal the mean outcome, and both will lie exactly at the centre of the darkest band.  But this will not be the case if the risks are asymmetric.  If the risks to inflation are more on one side of the central case than the other, then the distribution will be skewed, with the average (mean) outcome above or below the most likely (modal) outcome.  If the distribution is sufficiently skewed, the mean will lie outside the central band.   The median outturn defines the point in the distribution at which there is an even chance of higher or lower inflation.  In a skewed distribution, the median will lie between the mean and mode. There are many alternative ways of illustrating pictorially the same underlying probability distribution.  But different methods of illustration do not alter what is being illustrated.  Policy is unaffected by how a fan chart is drawn.

Prospects for inflation 53 6.3 Other forecasts Section 3 described the fall in survey measures of inflation expectations for the next one to two years.  That fall is mirrored in the information gathered from 29 forecasters surveyed by the Bank.  The median forecast for the year to 1999 Q4 was 2.1% in January, rising slightly to 2.3% for 2000 Q4, and reaching 2.5% in  2001 Q1.  The estimates for 1999 and 2000 are a little lower than the projections made at the time of the October survey.  Chart 6.8 shows the distribution of central forecasts for the twelve-month rate of RPIX inflation in 2001 Q1. The forecasters surveyed by the Bank also provided their assessments of the probabilities that they attach to various outcomes for inflation and growth (see  Table 6.B).  They assign just over 40% probability to inflation being above the target in the first quarter of 2001, and just under 60% probability to it being below. These estimates are broadly the same as at the time of the October survey.  The average projection for GDP growth in the year to 1999 Q4 is 3/4% (with a range of projections from -3/4% to 13/4%), rising to 21/2% in the year to 2001 Q1 (with a range of 3/4% to 31/2%).  The estimate for 1999 Q4 is similar to that at the time of the November Report.  Overall, the forecasters assign a 20% probability to output growth falling below zero in the year to 1999 Q4, compared with 21% at the time of the October survey. The implications of the latest projections for the stance of monetary policy are discussed in the Overview at the beginning of the Report.

Prior to the meeting, the Committee was briefed by Treasury officials on the Chancellor’s latest projections for economic activity and the public finances. Survey evidence, domestic demand, activity 2 The evidence of a sharp slowdown in domestic output growth was strongest in the surveys and in reports from the Bank’s regional Agencies.  Both business and consumer confidence had continued to deteriorate during October.  Survey indicators of export orders had been very weak for some time, but the domestic activity indicators had fallen sharply in the latest month, and this had extended to services as well as manufacturing;  the CIPS measure of incoming new business, for example, was below 50, although business expectations remained quite buoyant.  There had not been such an abrupt change in sentiment in manufacturing—as measured by the CBI Industrial Trends Survey of business optimism—since the early 1980s.  It was, however, difficult to make comparisons with the past as there were now many more surveys, mostly with relatively short histories. 3 The Bank’s regional Agents had for some time been indicating that the economy was slowing, but their reports over the past two months indicated a sharper slowdown.  The Committee noted that the Agents had identified evidence of the downturn in the early 1990s before it had become apparent in the official data. 4 This latest evidence suggested that the slowdown was more marked than predicted in the Committee’s August central projection, although measured GDP growth in Q3 was slightly stronger than expected.  In judging how much weight to place on survey data, the Committee discussed possible causes and its consistency with recent data on demand and activity. 5 One source of accumulating stress had been the substantial appreciation in the real exchange rate from mid-1996.  This had not immediately hit confidence, in marked contrast to some earlier episodes when sterling had risen sharply, for example in the 1970s and early 1980s.  And its impact on net trade had in fact taken much longer to emerge than the Bank had originally expected. There were various possible explanations for this, each of which probably had some validity.  Some firms had initially had in place financial market hedges against currency movements, but anecdotal evidence suggested probably not much beyond a year.  Similarly some firms would have enjoyed a degree of stability until contracts with overseas trading partners matured and were renegotiated. There might also have been a delayed effect where plans and major investment and expansion projects were reviewed at infrequent intervals.  And, more generally, businesses had had to judge how persistent sterling’s appreciation would be.  As discussed at previous meetings and in earlier Inflation Reports, these and other factors might have contributed to long lags in the impact of sterling’s appreciation on export volumes.  As the effects became evident, the implications for the economy generally of a slowdown in the trade of externally exposed businesses might have become more apparent to firms in relatively more sheltered sectors and to consumers.  For example, just as a buoyant services sector and strong domestic demand growth had probably helped to sustain growth in manufacturing for a while, so services would not be insulated from a manufacturing slowdown. 6 In the absence of other factors, the slowdown brought about by sterling’s appreciation and the tightening of monetary and fiscal policy could plausibly have been associated with a gradual decline in domestic sentiment rather than the sharp fall indicated by surveys.  But the world economic outlook had been affected over the summer by a series of adverse shocks, which would further reduce external demand for UK exports and sharpen price competition from imports.  Confidence in the financial services industry had been hit;  optimism in the financial sector, as measured by the CBI Financial Services Survey, was lower in 1998 Q3 than for eight years.  Well publicised job cuts in a range of sectors, whether or not directly affected by general economic conditions, had probably increased awareness of the changing outlook. 7 The preliminary official estimate suggested that Q3 GDP growth was unchanged at 0.5%, still close to trend.  But the latest industrial production numbers showed that output had recently been falling;  in particular, manufacturing output fell by 1.1% between July and September, with falls in most parts of the production industries.  These numbers were more consistent with what recent surveys had been indicating, and gave grounds for thinking that the Q3 GDP number might be revised down.  Separately there were signs in recent surveys—for example in the monthly CBI Industrial Trends Survey and the CBI Distributive Trades Survey—that recent output growth might have been associated with greater than planned stockbuilding, with production not yet fully adjusted to weakening demand. 8 On the expenditure side, the Committee noted that the latest data showed falling retail sales growth, and lower turnover in the housing market compared with a year ago.  Despite the recent sharp rebound, the equity market was 15% lower than its peak in July, which would tend to reduce consumption growth via its effect on households wealth, and reduce investment demand via a higher cost of capital. 9 There were, therefore, signs in the data that a slowdown, as indicated by surveys, was occurring.  The direction of change was clear.  But it was quite possible that the surveys were painting too bleak a picture.  For example, the equity market had not fallen to a level that would reduce consumption to the extent suggested by surveys.  And the surveys had historically been more volatile than recorded output and so could mislead.  Moreover, the tone of some public comment had moved from predicting a slowdown through a downturn, to a recession and even a slump.  That was extreme, and might be contributing to deteriorating confidence.  It could, therefore, have some effect on spending. 10 In the light of all these considerations, the Committee judged that the forward-looking evidence from surveys and the Bank’s regional Agents should be given increased weight in assessing the outlook for activity and inflation.  The Committee thought that the economy should, however, be better placed to face adverse shocks than in the early 1990s, in large part because both corporate and personal sector balance sheets (especially in the housing market) and liquidity were stronger now than then, and inflation had already reached the target.  Moreover, monetary growth remained robust. The most likely outcome was for continuing positive output growth in 1999, though at a lower rate than expected in August, and the downside risks had increased. Implications of the world economic environment 11 The international environment remained fragile.  There was still considerable uncertainty about the prospects for recovery in the Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 4–5 November 1998  Inflation Report:  February 1999 58 Japanese economy.  The recession there was deeper than had been assumed in the Committee’s August forecast.  Most forecasters had revised down their projections for continental European growth. According to the initial estimate, Q3 growth in the United States had been stronger than expected, although some of that strength might be the result of involuntary inventory accumulation.  US broad monetary growth remained quite strong.  The risks of further contagion and shocks to emerging market economies seemed to have reduced somewhat over the past month, and the extreme uncertainty in some markets had lessened, perhaps helped most recently by the G7 statement. 12 An important element of the Committee’s analysis was the deteriorating outlook for world trade given the poor prospects in Japan and some emerging market economies.  Between 1980 and 1993 world trade had grown at an average annual rate of 4%.  This had risen to around 9% in 1994–97, but was projected by the international organisations to fall to 4%–6% over 1998–2000.  Part of the expected fall was attributable to (perhaps temporarily) reduced intra-Asian trade, which had accounted for much of the earlier increase.  The Committee thought that the near term growth rate of the UK’s export markets should fall by less than overall world trade.  But on the other hand the strength of sterling, although less pronounced than in August, was likely to mean that UK exports would grow less quickly than UK export markets over the forecast period.  The Committee agreed that it was most likely that net trade would contribute negatively to output growth over the next two years. 13 The weakening in the external environment had also had a material effect on world prices.  Commodity prices were still falling, as were input prices more generally.  Looking forward, the expected rate of world price inflation had fallen compared with a quarter ago, reducing expected imported inflation and thus the outlook for RPIX.  This was an important factor in the Committee’s inflation projection.  In addition, domestic output price inflation was at its lowest level since 1975.  Both CBI and BCC surveys indicated further falls. The labour market 14 The Committee discussed a range of labour market indicators.  LFS employment had risen quite strongly in the three months to August, as had total hours worked.  On the other hand, LFS unemployment had increased slightly.  The number of economically inactive people had fallen.  Overall the latest quantity data suggested that conditions were still tight but might no longer be tightening. 15 Earnings growth was a key indicator of domestically generated inflation.  While labour market pressures should abate and earnings growth ease as the economy slowed, the implications for inflation would also depend on the current rate of earnings growth.  There was greater than normal uncertainty about this, given the problems with the AEI.  The Committee agreed to reflect this in its forecast variance. Monetary and credit conditions 16 The future path of interest rates expected by the market was lower than a month ago, and much lower than at the time of the August Inflation Report.  Taken together with the Committee’s  25 basis point cut at its October meeting, this had delivered some easing in monetary conditions. 17 Sterling had fallen 41/4% from the 15-day average used in the projections published in the August Inflation Report.  This would tend to reduce the restraining effect on inflation from sterling’s earlier appreciation.  The Committee judged that the balance of risks was still in the direction of sterling falling by more than assumed in its central projection, although the downside risk was not as large as in August. 18 The Committee noted that broad money and credit growth remained robust.  High broad money growth remained an upside risk to the inflation outlook.  Unsecured lending to the personal sector continued to grow rapidly, although the macroeconomic consequences were possibly not great as it accounted for only around 20% of the stock of lending to the personal sector. 19 Of more immediate interest was whether there were signs of a material tightening in credit conditions.  The spread of corporate bond yields over government bond yields had increased significantly since the Russian and Long-Term Capital Management crises, corporate issuance was lower than usual, and actual and implied volatility were higher in a number of markets. But, perhaps in contrast to the United States, there was no evidence that the credit process had been significantly interrupted in the United Kingdom.  Corporate bond and swap market spreads had eased slightly from the peaks, but were still high by previous standards.  There had recently been some domestic corporate bond issuance in sterling, as well as a more marked return of issuance in international bond markets.  Perhaps more significantly, UK banking markets seemed to have been less affected by the turbulence than capital markets.  Conditions in wholesale money markets seemed reasonably calm.  The syndicated credit markets had remained open;  spreads had risen in this market too, but by rather less than in capital markets.  The September M4 numbers did not suggest emergency drawing down of deposits, and showed continued robust growth in lending to the corporate sector.  It was possible that that reflected reintermediation into the banking sector of some borrowing that would previously have been undertaken in the capital markets.  This was widely believed to be occurring in the US, but dependence on capital market borrowing was much greater there.  Evidence of this happening in the United Kingdom was less clear.  The UK banking sector was, on the basis of currently available information, well capitalised by the standards of recent decades and so prospectively capable of reintermediating credit flows if that were to prove necessary. 20 The Committee agreed that so far there was no evidence of a ‘credit crunch’ in the sense of a material tightening of credit conditions for a given general level of interest rates and borrower credit risk.  The environment had nevertheless changed somewhat. On the one hand, the general level of medium-longer maturity interest rates had fallen in recent months, so that the level of nominal yields (and probably real yields) on corporate bonds had fallen for at least the highest credit ratings, notwithstanding the widening of spreads.  This would tend to be supportive of activity. On the other hand, as the economy slowed and as the shocks from the external environment affected the UK, the creditworthiness of some borrowers was deteriorating, which would affect the terms on which they could obtain credit.  The corporate sector as a whole was, however, stronger financially than in the late 1980s-early 1990s, and thus should generally be better able to withstand a downturn. 21 The Committee agreed that world financial markets were calmer than a few weeks earlier.  But the possibility of a tightening of credit conditions in the future needed to be kept under careful review. The MPC’s November forecast 22 The Committee reviewed its forecast, which was described fully in the Inflation Report published in the week following the meeting. 23 The general shape of the projections was as follows.  Output growth was expected to fall for a year or so before recovering, principally via stronger domestic demand growth.  In the second half of the forecast period and beyond, an important source of this increased demand was public sector consumption and investment, but there was some uncertainty about the timing of public investment spending.  The balance of risks to activity were on the  Monetary Policy Committee 59 downside, largely on account of the external environment and risks to consumption.  The central projection for inflation rose somewhat in the short run before falling.  The balance of risks to the inflation outlook were modestly on the upside until mid-2000 and then modestly on the downside, but overall closer to neutral throughout the forecast period than in August when the balance of risks had clearly been on the upside. 24 There was a more important difference from the August forecast.  For any given level of interest rates, the level of the projections for output growth and inflation were now both lower.  If interest rates were left at 7.25%, the central projection for inflation would undershoot the target at the end of the forecast period. 25 The Committee discussed whether there were any major eventualities not captured in the forecast.  It had increased the short-term uncertainty underlying the published projections to reflect the problems with the AEI numbers, but it was very difficult to judge the degree of extra uncertainty created.  It was possible that further adverse news about the world economy could dent the outlook for output growth still further.  And it was possible that weak world price inflation and the fall in domestic inflation expectations would have a bigger than assumed impact on RPIX. On the other hand, the recent recovery in the equity market meant that at the time of the meeting equity prices were 6% higher than the 15-day average used in the forecast.  Overall the Committee felt that the important factors were reflected in the forecast. 26 The Committee noted that the shape and level of the projections were different when made using market expectations of the likely path of interest rates (as derived from the short sterling futures contract adjusted for the typical premium between unsecured interbank deposit rates and gilt repo rates).  Faster growth was implied, and a central projection for inflation which was above the target throughout 1999 and 2000.  The Inflation Report would show the difference between projections based on constant interest rates and market rates (as at 4 November). 27 The Committee discussed the predictions of a sample of outside forecasters.  The average forecast of GDP in the year to  Q4 1999 was down by one percentage point since August.  Most forecasters predicted recovery in 2000.  Inflation profiles were generally lower than three months ago.  The average of outside forecasts was similar to the Bank’s central projection. Tactical considerations 28 While reiterating its earlier expressed view that there could be no mechanical or precise link between the forecast and policy settings, the Committee agreed that its latest forecast clearly pointed to a further cut in official interest rates.  Before turning to the immediate policy decision, members first discussed a number of tactical considerations. 29 Was there a case for delaying part of any desired rate cut on the grounds that some of the uncertainty about the earnings data should be resolved by the December or January meetings?  The Committee agreed that this should not affect its immediate decision.  It would need to take account of the new information about earnings as and when it became available, changing interest rates then if necessary. 30 What would be the impact of different sized cuts on confidence and expectations in the real economy and financial markets?  A range of views was expressed on this.  One possible view was that, taken in isolation, a cut of more than 25 basis points might create the misleading impression that the outlook was worse than implied by the Committee’s central projection on the grounds that (i) financial markets thought the most likely outcome of the meeting was a cut of 25 basis points;  and (ii) the Committee had so far moved (in both directions) in steps of 25 basis points.  But, against this, any move would in fact be followed by publication of the Inflation Report a week later.  Whatever the Committee’s decision, policy would then be seen in the light of its forecast for inflation. 31 A second possible view was that there would be positive merit in moving by more than 25 basis points in order to display that, as the Committee had said before, it was prepared to move in larger steps.  The Committee agreed that while that might be a welcome by-product of a cut of more than 25 basis points, it could not be part of the reason for such a cut, which had to depend on its assessment of the inflation outlook.  A similarly welcome  by-product, but again not one that could affect the decision, was that a larger than expected cut would underline the symmetry of the Committee’s remit, ie that a prospect of falling below the 21/2% target was taken as seriously as exceeding the target. 32 A third possible view was that the Committee should err on the side of a larger cut in order to underpin business and consumer confidence in the economy.  Against this it was felt that, whatever its size, the effect of a reduction in interest rates on confidence would depend on the justification for it.  The Committee also needed to bear in mind that the larger the cut, the more likely it was that sterling would fall, which would tend to increase the price level and thus temporarily increase future expected inflation. The immediate policy decision 33 By way of background, the Committee noted that over the past six years the economy had on average grown above trend, and until quite recently had still been growing at a rate that could not be sustained given the economy’s productive capacity.  That had been the justification for the past tightening of monetary policy. Relatively high short-term real rates of interest, fiscal policy tightening and the appreciation of the exchange rate had all helped to keep inflation in check, but it had still not fallen below 21/2%, which was indicative of the strength of domestically generated inflationary pressures.  Since August there had been a lot of news affecting the outlook for activity and inflation, including the fall in sterling, the shocks to the world economy, and the evidence from surveys and the Bank’s regional Agents of a sharp fall in business and consumer confidence.  The extent of the lags between these developments and their effect on growth and inflation was highly uncertain, but they implied lower activity growth and inflation than expected in August. 34 Against this background, the Committee discussed the arguments for interest rate cuts of 25 basis points, 50 basis points, and of up to 75 basis points. 35 Possible arguments identified for a 25 basis point cut were that the unusually high uncertainty about the earnings data pointed to caution in any move;  that the Committee should avoid surprising financial markets given the risk of sterling falling if it did so;  and that the Committee should avoid taking actions that could be construed as trying to fine tune output growth in 1999.  On the first of these points the Committee agreed that if the earnings data were substantially revised upwards the interest rate move might need to be reversed, but that was not per se an argument for moving in small steps now.  On the second point, the Committee agreed that the risk of surprising the financial markets could not justify limiting the cut to a size that would leave the central projection for inflation materially below the target in the second year of the forecast.  On the third point, the Committee agreed that monetary policy could not have a significant impact on output growth in 1999 given the lags in its effects.  But this did not amount to an argument for a  25 basis point cut. 36 The arguments identified for a 50 basis point cut, supported in varying degrees by those members of the Committee who voted for this course of action, were as follows.  First, on the central projection, with a 50 basis point cut inflation would rise slightly above the target before returning to around 2.5% at the two year  Inflation Report:  February 1999 60 horizon, with the risks initially on the upside and later on the downside, and with uncertainty greater at the longer horizons.  By contrast, if rates were cut by 75 basis points, inflation would be above the target throughout the year 2000 on the central projection and up to the third quarter of 2000 even if the balance of downside risks assumed in the forecast materialised.  Second, a larger cut might cause sterling to fall by more than was taken into account in the forecast.  Third, notwithstanding the opportunity to explain any policy decision in the following week’s Inflation Report, there could well be a prolonged effect on perceptions of the Committee’s assessment of the outlook, with a risk that people, businesses and markets mistakenly concluded that the Committee knew something that it had not disclosed about the outlook. 37 Among those members favouring an immediate 50 basis point cut, there was a range of views on the likely future course of policy.  On one view, it was more likely than not that further cuts would at some point be needed, but the lags in the economy meant that it was not optimal to make those cuts now.  It was argued that further cuts could over time be necessary because at 6.75% official rates would still most probably be above the ‘neutral’ rate implied by an equilibrium real interest rate and the 21/2% inflation target.  It was also possible that the near-term downward pressures on UK domestic prices might be greater than reflected in the projection. On another view, the short run outlook for future policy was more evenly balanced, bearing in mind continued domestically generated inflationary pressures. 38 The arguments identified for a cut of up to 75 basis points were as follows.  First, given that the balance of risks to inflation was on the downside at the end of the forecast period, inflation could be expected to undershoot the target in about two years’ time if rates were cut by only 50 basis points.  The size of cut should take account of these risks.  A cut of more than 50 basis points— possibly 75 basis points, possibly in between—could be viewed as taking out insurance against those risks, with the precise size depending on the weight given to the downside risks and the value placed on insurance.  Second, a larger cut might fortify otherwise fragile business and consumer confidence, helping to guard against the effects of encircling gloom and thus worse outcomes than featured in the Committee’s forecast.  Third, while a larger cut might well surprise the markets, it could be carefully explained in the Inflation Report, so that the cost of any surprise should be  short-lived.  Fourth, cutting by more than 50 basis points was preferable to cutting by 50 basis points with an expectation of making further cuts later. 39 The Governor invited members of the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate be cut by 50 basis points to 6.75%.  Eight members of the Committee (the Governor, Mervyn King, David Clementi, Alan Budd, Charles Goodhart, DeAnne Julius, Ian Plenderleith and John Vickers) voted for the proposition.  Willem Buiter voted against, preferring a cut of  75 basis points. 40 The following members of the Committee were present: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Alan Budd Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers 41 Gus O’Donnell was also present as the Treasury representative.  Monetary Policy Committee 61 1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee on 30 October 1998, in advance of its meeting.  At the start of the Committee meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and that information is included in the Annex. I Financial markets Foreign exchange 2 Between 6 October and 8 October, $/yen had fallen from  132 to 112.  DM/yen had fallen by almost as much.  The trigger for these unusually large fall may have been the perception that progress was being made to resolve the banking problems in Japan. Poor liquidity had exacerbated the fall in the $/yen exchange rate, as participants who had borrowed cheap yen to fund positions elsewhere had attempted to unwind their positions.  After that, the yen had stabilised, perhaps reflecting a perception that a rate just below 120 was closer to its ‘equilibrium’ value.  One-month implied volatility for $/yen had remained at historically high levels, even though it had halved since 8 October.  The dollar had also fallen against other major currencies in recent months, reflecting expectations of interest rate cuts (which had been borne out) and concerns about the impact on the US trade balance of a Latin American recession.  However, on a broader measure of the effective exchange rate the dollar had only fallen by 4%. 3 The correlation between movement in the dollar and sterling had remained strong, and had possibly strengthened.  The 8 October MPC announcement cutting rates by 25 basis points and the 14 October downward revision to average earnings had coincided with significant moves in sterling, although the former came at the height of the $/yen turmoil, which appeared to have exaggerated the upward move.  Government bond and money markets 4 Implied interest rates had fallen at the short end of the yield curve following the MPC’s 25 basis point cut in October, and again after the US cut.  At longer maturities, the recovering equity market and sharp currency moves had been associated with higher yields. Most international bond markets had fallen following the sharp appreciation in the yen.  At the same time, market participants in the United States and United Kingdom had begun to expect more aggressive monetary easing, and this had been reflected in less inverted bond yield curves.  But the currency movements had also meant that some market participants had looked to close out their positions and, coupled with poor liquidity, these technical factors had probably exacerbated the yield changes.  Implied volatility in the long gilt future had fallen from a peak of around 13%, but had remained high, and futures turnover had fallen, suggesting that the markets remained less liquid than usual. 5 In the futures market, implied interest rates had fallen by about 30 basis points since the previous MPC meeting, whereas longer contracts had been at roughly the same level, implying that the market had brought forward when it expected rates to be cut, but not the extent of the easing it expected.  There had been a spread of 100 basis points between current three-month Libor and the short sterling March contract, implying that significant cuts in rates were expected before Easter.  A few market participants had expected a 50 basis point cut in November, although most had anticipated 25 basis points. 6 The spread between interbank and CD rates and gilt repo had been unusually high in late October.  This could be argued to have understated the rise in credit risk premia demanded by the market, because some weaker credits might have withdrawn from the market.  On the other hand, an increase in short term deposits at the major banks, subject to sterling stock liquidity requirements, would have tended to increase their demand for liquid assets including repo, and this could have worked to widen the interbank-repo spread. Equity markets 7 Equity indices had risen since the previous MPC meeting in most international markets.  In the United Kingdom, the relative fall in banking sector share prices in September had been reversed, while indices for utilities, property and food retailers, which had been seen as ‘safe havens’ during market turbulence, had underperformed the market.  Implied volatilities for the FT-SE 100 and S&P 500 had declined from their September peak, but remained above their 1998 averages.  Analysts’ forecasts for growth in earnings per share over the next year had declined further.  But analysts’ longer-term outlook for growth in earnings per share had remained constant, as they had done for most of 1998.  The number of profits warnings had been higher than a year earlier, with concerns about demand and problems in emerging markets frequently cited as reasons. II Monetary and credit conditions Monetary quantities 8 The (provisional) twelve-month growth rate of notes and coin (adjusted for 50p and £2 coin effects) had been 5.2% in October, compared with 5.7% in September.  The three and  six-month annualised growth rates had also fallen in October. Annual growth in broad money (M4) had been 9.0% in September, compared with 8.7% in August.  M4 growth in the third quarter of 1998 had been slightly up on the second quarter (2.2% in Q3, compared with 2.1% in Q2).  9 Households’ M4 had grown by more in September (£1.6 billion) than in August (£1.1 billion), with the twelve-month rate at 6.1%.  The twelve-month rate of growth of M4 of Other Financial Corporations (OFCs) had been 19.2% in September. According to the Merrill Lynch survey of fund managers, the ratio of cash to portfolio value of Insurance Companies and Pension Funds (ICPFs) had risen from 4.9% in September to 6.9% in October. 10 The slight pick-up in annual growth in aggregate Divisia in the third quarter (7.8%, compared with 7.7% in the second quarter) had been broadly similar to the pattern in the M4 data.  Within the aggregate, household Divisia growth had been unchanged in the third quarter at 6.6%;  the annual growth in OFCs’ Divisia had fallen back from 16.8% in the second quarter to 16.2% in the third; and the growth in Divisia of Private Non-Financial Corporations (PNFCs) had increased from 5.6% to 7.5% in the third quarter. 11 Aggregate M4 lending had been £6.2 billion in September, similar to August (£6.6 billion).  M4 lending to households had been increasing, with three and six-month annualised growth rates higher than the annual growth rate of 7.4%.  Within lending, annual growth in total secured lending to individuals, at 5.9%, had picked up slightly in the third quarter.  There had been a third consecutive monthly fall in the number of loan approvals for house purchase in September.  The annual growth in unsecured lending to individuals had remained strong (19.0% in the third quarter) and net credit card borrowing had also increased in September (by £439 million compared with £406 million in August), with the twelve-month growth rate at 26.5%.  There had been anecdotal evidence of a modest rise in arrears.  The twelve-month growth rate in lending to OFCs had been weaker in September, with a flow of £1.7 billion Annex:  Summary of data presented by Bank staff  Inflation Report:  February 1999 62 compared with £2.1 billion in August, with the annual rate of growth at 16.6%. Monetary prices 12 The 8 October cut in the Bank’s repo rate had not yet been passed on by banks and building societies into standard  variable-rate mortgages;  but many had announced that they would reduce standard variable rates from November.  In the secured market, fixed rates on mortgages had continued to fall, reflecting falls in comparable swap rates. 13 There was no direct measure of ex ante short-term real interest rates, but a measure could be constructed using the Merrill Lynch survey of fund managers’ short-term inflation expectations for the end of 1999.  This suggested that the real forward rate for 1999 had fallen from 4.3% in September to 4.1% in October. Have UK corporate credit conditions tightened? 14 Bank staff had examined whether the UK company sector had experienced a tightening in credit conditions.  Spreads on corporate bond yields over gilts had fallen since the previous MPC meeting, although they had remained at high levels relative to the 1990s average.  Similarly, US corporate bond indices had shown the credit spread on investment grade bonds to be at or near their highest levels in the 1990s.  A similar picture had emerged when looking at spreads in the swaps markets, both in the United States and the United Kingdom.  15 The syndicated loan market remained open, although spreads had widened by about 10 basis points for higher grades and more for lower-rated companies.  Conversations with market participants had suggested that some loan demand had been deferred;  others had borrowed before the recent turbulence hit the markets, and thought that it might be more difficult to borrow now. 16 Bankers had reported there had been no material change in the terms applied to customers of a given risk.  However, the creditworthiness of some firms had fallen with the worsening in the economic outlook.  A survey of major clearing banks had revealed that the demand for finance from small firms had been steady in the past six months, and for large firms had, if anything, increased.  17 Annual growth in PNFCs’ M4 deposits had been 6.5% in the third quarter, compared with 5.9% in the second quarter.  Growth in M4 lending to PNFCs had risen in the third quarter, to 6.0% compared with 5.1% in Q2.  Neither had suggested a rationing of credit, nor an emergency drawdown of deposits.  Total external finance had been steady at £3.2 billion in September. 18 One question had been whether the banking system’s capital could support a material reintermediation of credit if capital market borrowing remained low for a prolonged period.  The capital positions of the large UK banks in 1998 H1 had shown risk-asset ratios above the Basle 8% minimum. 19 Other evidence from the CBI Industrial Trends Survey in October 1998 had shown that 6% of firms thought that constraints on external finance might limit their ability to undertake investment.  This had been the highest proportion since January 1993.  But uncertainty about demand had been reported as a larger constraint on investment (56%, compared with 50% in September).  20 As to the financial strength of the corporate sector if credit conditions were to tighten, PNFCs’ capital gearing in 1998 Q2 (defined as the ratio of net debt outstanding to the market valuation of the capital stock), at 24.5%, was well below its previous peak (41.4% in 1990 Q3).  However, this partly reflected the rise in equity prices in recent years.  PNFCs’ income gearing, at 20.9%, had been well below the peak of 39.0% in 1990 Q2, although it had risen from the low of 16.7% in 1996 Q2 to 20.9% in 1998 Q2.  This had probably been related to repo rate rises over the period, and weakening profits.  Unlike companies in the United States, PNFCs in the United Kingdom had modest non-equity capital market obligations, compared with their liquid assets. III The international economy 21 In the United States, a slowdown in the real economy had become more evident.  Quarterly consumption growth in 1998 Q3 had slowed to 1.0% from 1.5% in both Q1 and Q2, and investment growth had fallen to 0.4% in Q3, from 4.7% in Q1 and 3.1% in Q2. Overall, US GDP had grown by 0.8%, to 3.4% higher than a year before. 22 Industrial production in the United States had fallen by 0.3% in September, to 2.5% higher than a year earlier.  Capacity utilisation had been 81.1% in September and, although distorted by the GM strike, had been trending lower since the end of 1997.  The NAPM index had fallen to 48.3 in October, from 49.4 in September. The US trade balance had widened to $16.8 billion in August from $14.5 billion in July.  This had been because of a larger goods deficit;  the services surplus had remained little changed.  Export volumes had fallen year-on-year for the second consecutive month, while the growth in import volumes had slowed.  US consumer confidence had fallen by 9 points in October, its fourth consecutive monthly fall, to its lowest level since October 1997.  Annual CPI inflation had fallen to 1.4% in September from 1.7% in August, and annual average earnings growth had fallen to 4% in the year to September, from 4.1% in August.  The IMF had forecast US GDP growth to be 2.0% in 1999, down from 3.5% in 1998. 23 In the prospective euro area (EU11), industrial confidence had fallen further in August and September in most member countries.  Industrial production had rebounded in Germany, rising by 3.1% on Q2, but had fallen back in France (-0.1%) and Italy  (-0.9%).  Consumer confidence in the EU11 had fallen by  1 percentage point between July and September.  Annual EU11 consumer price inflation on the harmonised measure had fallen to 1.0% in September down from 1.2% in August.  Harmonised inflation had fallen in Germany (to 0.6%) and France (to 0.5%). Money supply across the EU11 had grown by 4.7% in the year to July, down from 5.7% in June. 24 Japan’s industrial production had fallen 8.4% in the year to September.  Inventories had fallen by 1.8% over the year.  Total employment had fallen by 1.1% over the year to September, with job losses concentrated in the construction and manufacturing sectors.  Retail sales in Japan had fallen by 5.1% in September from a year ago.  Imports had fallen by 9.3%, while exports had grown 3.9% over the year to September.  Japan’s trade surplus with the United States was ¥0.7 trillion in September, and ¥0.4 trillion with the European Union.  Deflationary pressures had been continuing— wholesale prices in September had fallen by 1.5% on an annual basis, and annual consumer price inflation in September had fallen to -0.2%.  The IMF had forecast a fall in GDP in 1998 of 2.5% and a rise of 0.5% in 1999. IV Demand and output 25 The preliminary estimate for GDP growth in 1998 Q3 had been 0.5%, the same rate as in Q2.  The annual rate of growth had slowed from 3.0% in the year to Q2 to 2.5% in the year to Q3. Service sector output had grown by 0.6% in Q3, the same rate as in Q2.  Manufacturing output had fallen by 0.6% in August and 0.4% in September.  Survey evidence had suggested that the fall in manufacturing output would be the beginning of a sustained decline.  Manufacturing output over the third quarter had fallen slightly, by 0.1%, in contrast to ONS indications in the GDP preliminary estimate for the third quarter of ‘a small increase’. This had raised the possibility of a downward revision to GDP growth in 1998 Q3. 26 The boost to GDP growth from utilities output in 1998 Q2 had not unwound in Q3 so the level remained relatively high.  Monetary Policy Committee 63 Monthly industrial production data had shown that electricity, gas and water supply had increased by 1.1% in 1998 Q3, though output had fallen by 1.6% in September.  The ONS had also reported that construction and agricultural output had risen overall in Q3. 27 On the expenditure side, retail sales had fallen by 0.4% in September, having increased in the previous two months.  Annual growth over the latest three months had increased to 3.1% in September from 2.4% in August.  This had partly reflected weak sales in September 1997.  Nonetheless, ONS data had suggested that, although slowing, growth had remained above average, a stronger out-turn than indicated by either the CBI Distributive Trades Survey or data from the British Retail Consortium. Quarterly growth in retail sales volumes in Q3 had been 0.7%, compared with 0.2% in Q2 (though consumption of retail goods in the National Accounts had increased by 0.9% in Q2).  Services consumption had fallen in Q2, because of lower catering and financial services spending.  Output data so far available had suggested that another fall in the third quarter was unlikely. Overall, it was possible that household spending would increase by more in Q3 than in Q2 (0.4%). 28 Analysis of surveys of consumer confidence supported a picture of an underlying slowdown in consumption growth.  The GfK and MORI surveys had declined further in October.  The MORI balance had fallen to -46 from -37 in September, as low as in October 1992 and September 1990.  The aggregate GfK balance had fallen to -8.2, 18 points below its recent peak.  In the past, the level of consumer confidence had been a timely, coincident indicator of household spending growth.  The recent deterioration in the GfK survey had been because of deteriorating sentiment about the general economic situation.  Perceptions about households’ own situations had held up better.  Analysis had shown that survey responses to general economy-wide questions had been, if anything, better correlated with spending growth in the past than household-specific questions.  Analysis had also suggested that consumer confidence contained additional information about spending over and above other determinants of consumption such as income, wealth etc;  and that it had some predictive power for future spending as well as current spending. 29 The Halifax and Nationwide prices indices had both recorded increases in October.  But housing turnover had fallen in September, with particulars delivered 5.7% lower than a year ago, though 4.8% higher over the latest three months than the previous three months.  Net lending secured on dwellings had fallen in September, leaving the twelve-month growth rate unchanged at 5.8%;  and loan approvals had fallen to their lowest level in 1998. Survey data from RICS and HBF had also indicated activity moderating. 30 Service sector investment intentions for plant and equipment had fallen from a balance of +27 to +14 in the latest British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) survey, though they had remained around their average level since 1989.  Manufacturing investment intentions had fallen from a balance of +13 in Q2, to 0 in Q3.  In the October CBI quarterly Industrial Trends Survey, the balance had fallen from -21 to -32 for plant and equipment, and from -26 to -36 for buildings.  However, construction orders had remained relatively high, rising by 6% in the three months to August.  The CIPS Report on Construction had indicated falling orders in October for the first time this year, although the optimism index had remained strong. 31 There had been some evidence of rising stocks in the manufacturing and retail sectors in survey data.  The CBI Industrial Trends Survey had reported a rise in the balance of firms reporting excessive stocks (+26 in October).  The CBI Distributive Trades Survey had recorded a higher balance of retailers reporting high stocks relative to expected sales:  +23 in October, compared with an average balance since 1992 of +19.  Retailers were likely to unwind any excess inventories fairly quickly. 32 The PSNCR had been £1.6 billion in September, and £2.7 billion over the first six months of the financial year 1998/99. Spending had been 2.7% higher over the first six months of 1998/99 compared with a year earlier.  This had suggested continued growth in government consumption in 1998 Q3. 33 Goods trade data had pointed to a negative contribution from net trade in 1998 Q3.  There had been little change in the trade deficit in August:  £1.2 billion compared with £1.4 billion in July (excluding oil and erratics).  The deficit with EU countries had narrowed, while the deficit with non-EU countries had widened. And there had been a large increase in the deficit with non-EU countries in September.  Import and export volumes had both increased in the three months to August, but imports by more.  For 1998 Q3 as a whole, imports from non-EU countries had risen by 4.6%;  exports had fallen by 0.7%. 34 Surveys suggested that business sentiment had continued to weaken.  The BCC survey had reported negative balances for home deliveries and home orders in the manufacturing sector of -12 and -16 respectively for Q3, compared with +3 and +2 respectively for Q2.  And there had been further sharp falls in export orders and deliveries.  This had brought the BCC survey more in to line with the CBI survey, both indicating further falls in manufacturing output.  BCC services balances had remained positive, but had fallen.  Home orders and deliveries balances had fallen for the third consecutive quarter, and by the largest degree between Q2 and Q3 since the previous recession, consistent with a slowdown in services output growth in Q4. 35 There had also been a further decline in CBI Industrial Trends survey balances.  The business optimism balance had fallen to its lowest level since July 1980.  This might be a better indicator of output in the manufacturing sector rather than GDP given the nature of the downturn.  Sentiment towards exports had stabilised, but at very low levels.  In contrast, indicators of domestic activity had fallen sharply:  the reported output balance from -4 to -30, expected output from -8 to -29.  The CIPS Report on Manufacturing output index had fallen to 41.6 in October, a new low, and the largest monthly fall since the survey began in 1991.  The CIPS Report on Services had shown the first fall in the incoming new business index since the survey began in mid 1996.  And the outstanding business index had continued to fall, and by its largest amount in October (44.9). V Labour market 36 The Labour Force Survey (LFS) measure of employment had risen by 122,000 (0.5%) in the three months to August, compared with the previous three months.  If anything, the rate of increase had appeared to be rising—the average quarterly increase over the past year had been 77,000.  Thus the contrast between the strength in LFS employment and the weakness in recent Workforce Jobs figures had become even more marked, though more weight should be attached to the LFS figures (given their lower sampling variance and the possibility of special factors affecting the Workforce Jobs data).  The increase in LFS employment in June to August had reflected a large 222,000 (0.9%) increase in employees, partly offset by a 94,000 (2.9%) fall in the numbers self-employed.  And it had been more than accounted for by an increase in full-time employment (part-time employment fell slightly).  Total hours worked had increased by 0.6% over the quarter, so hours per head were broadly unchanged. 37 Turning to survey information, the CIPS October surveys had suggested that employment growth in services had been weakening but remained positive, construction employment had been unchanged, and the rate of job loss in manufacturing had been increasing.  This sectoral picture was broadly consistent with reports from the Bank’s regional Agents.  The BCC survey for Q3 had shown a fall in employment intentions in services, though they had remained positive, while the balance of manufacturers  Inflation Report:  February 1999 64 expecting to recruit staff had fallen sharply to almost zero.  The CBI Industrial Trends Survey for Q3 had also shown a large deterioration in manufacturing employment intentions, the seasonally adjusted balance falling to its lowest level since 1993. 38 New notifications of vacancies had risen by 4,000 in September, with the stock of vacancies broadly unchanged. National press advertising had risen to another high in August, reflecting sustained demand for staff at the top end of the labour market.  The FRES report had showed that recruitment agency business had continued to increase in September, but the rate of growth had fallen back to its weakest this year.  The BCC survey had shown some easing in recruitment difficulties in both manufacturing and services, though they still persisted.  And the CBI Industrial Trends survey for Q3 had shown a further fall in the balance of manufacturers quoting skill shortages as a factor likely to limit output. 39 LFS unemployment had increased by 9,000 in the three months to August, compared with the previous three months.  The rise had partly reflected a 28,000 increase in unemployment among 16–17 year olds.  Despite the rise, the rate of LFS unemployment remained unchanged to the nearest decimal point at 6.3%.  The claimant count had continued to fall in September (by 12,000), with part of the fall likely to have reflected a New Deal effect.   40 According to LFS figures, the number of economically inactive people of working age had fallen by 93,000 in the three months to August, which contrasted with the increases recorded in the previous three quarters. 41 The ONS had announced a further set of revisions to the earnings data on 14 October following a rebasing exercise, which had resulted in significant revisions to the earnings data going back to 1991.  The key factors behind the revisions had been:  the use of new employment weights to aggregate earnings in different industries;  the application of new grossing factors to firms in different size bands to make the sample more representative;  and the use of a new public/private sector classification, which reflected legal as well as industrial status.  However, there were a number of features of the revised data that had been difficult to understand and, partly for this reason, an external enquiry into the figures had been set up.  The ONS subsequently issued a press release on  2 November suspending publication of the figures until it was satisfied about their quality. 42 According to the revised figures, headline annual earnings growth had peaked in 1998 in June (at 5.2%), not in April as previously thought, and had dropped back to 4.6% in July.  But more puzzling was that the revised series had suggested that aggregate earnings growth had fallen rather than risen in 1997, at a time when the quantities data had suggested that the labour market was tightening.  This change in profile was more pronounced in the services data;  the manufacturing profile was much more similar to the old data.  43 Another puzzle in the revised data had been that they suggested that public sector earnings had accelerated from  mid-1997, not grown at a broadly constant rate of around 2.5% to 3.0% as had previously been thought.  On the new figures, headline public sector earnings grew by 4.6% in the year to July (up from 4.5% in June), which compared with private sector earnings growth of 4.7% (down from 5.4%).   44 A further puzzle in the new data concerned bonuses. Previously it had been thought that irregular pay had constantly made a positive contribution to the annual growth of average earnings in 1997 and 1998.  But according to the new figures, the contribution had been erratic, and the large positive contribution of bonuses and other irregular payments in March 1998, seen in the unrevised data, was no longer apparent. 45 The revised figures had seemed difficult to reconcile with other measures of earnings, none of which had suggested weaker growth during 1997.  The growth rate of the National Accounts measure of wages and salaries per head had increased during 1997–98, though these figures were partly derived from the Average Earnings Index and were therefore subject to be revised if the quality of the new series was confirmed.  The Reward Index of earnings growth had also been stronger than the revised Average Earnings Index in 1997 and 1998, despite having dropped back recently (to 5.1% in September).  And a comparison with figures from the annual New Earnings Survey also suggested that earnings growth in recent years had if anything been closer to the old average earnings series, than the revised one.   46 The view that wage pressure had eased in 1997 was also not supported by evidence from wage settlements which had increased through 1997 and the early part of 1998.  And there had been no evidence of a slowdown in wage settlements in recent months:  the twelve-month employment weighted mean measure remained at 3.7% in September for the fifth consecutive month. VI Prices 47 Commodity prices had continued to fall in September.  The Bank index excluding oil had fallen by 0.6% in September, mainly because of metals and food prices.  The index had fallen by 18% since its peak in March 1996.  But United Nations data had suggested that the recent weakness of commodity prices relative  to consumer prices was in line with the trend change over the previous thirty years.  Input price deflation had persisted:  prices had fallen by 1.1% in September and by 9.8% since  September 1997.  The price of Brent crude oil had fallen to $13.19 a barrel by 28 October. 48 Annual output price inflation had fallen to its lowest rates for over twenty years in September:  output price inflation excluding excise duties (PPIY) to -0.6% (its lowest rate since 1975) and total output price inflation to 0.3% (its lowest rate since 1960).  The CBI and BCC surveys had continued to suggest that output price inflation might fall further.  Their weakness relative to the official data might have been explained by the split between gross and net output price inflation.  The gross index, which includes intermediate prices within the manufacturing sector, had been falling, while the net index had risen slightly, implying intermediate price deflation.  It was possible the survey balances had reflected gross output price deflation better than the net numbers published in the headline producer price index.  Trade prices had also continued to fall.  Export prices to the European Union had fallen by 0.4% in August.  Import prices had fallen further in 1998 from countries outside the European Union (-9.4% in the year to September), but had remained broadly unchanged from other EU countries (-5.9% in the year to September). 49 RPIX inflation had remained at 2.5% in September, while RPIY and RPI inflation had both fallen by 0.1 percentage point, to 2.0% and 3.2% respectively.  RPIX services prices had risen by 3.5% in the year to September, up from 3.2% in August.  That had reflected the reduction of the VAT rate payable on domestic fuel in September 1997, which had fallen out of the annual inflation rate. Household services had risen sharply, partly owing to private school fees.  The HICP inflation rate had risen by 0.2 percentage points in September to 1.5%, whereas the RPIX inflation rate had remained unchanged.  But the difference had been almost entirely due to rounding.  The retail sales deflator had been revised as part of the rebasing of the retail sales index, which had been published since the previous MPC meeting.  But annual retail sales price inflation had remained close to its previous rates and stood at 0.6% in September. VII Reports by the Bank’s regional Agents 50 The Bank’s regional Agents had undertaken a survey of their contacts on domestic credit conditions.  They had asked whether the demand for finance had changed over recent months.  40% of  Monetary Policy Committee 65 respondents reported unchanged usage of finance, 48% increased use and 12% reduced use.  Of those who had increased their demand for loans, some had done so because of deteriorating trading conditions.  They had also asked whether firms thought that the terms and conditions of finance offered by banks had worsened. Most contacts had said that they had not.  10% of contacts had reported that they had recently had a loan request turned down. The Agents had also contacted local clearing bank representatives. They had suggested that they had for some time been seeking to improve loan quality and exercising more due diligence, and that this had not been connected with the recent turbulence in financial markets.  Some contacts had reported that the terms of syndicated loans had tightened. 51 Looking ahead, the Agents reported that contacts had expected credit conditions to tighten in the future as the economy slowed.  Some respondents had thought that small and  medium-sized enterprises would have been most affected by this. The Agents had also asked about the exposure of their contacts to emerging markets, which had appeared to be limited.  For example, although 60% of manufacturing firms had some sales exposure, only 20% of these had more than 10% of their sales in emerging markets. 52 The Agents also reported on general discussions with their contacts.  The outlook for activity reported by manufacturing firms had been more in line with the deterioration recorded in the survey data than the most recent ONS data.  All Agents had reported further declines in orders, and there were particular concerns about the first half of 1999.  Export orders had remained extremely weak and some firms had reported a loss of domestic market share to importers.  Services growth had continued to slow, and had spread to sectors such as catering and leisure.  Retail spending had slowed, with firms reporting falling sales of clothing and household goods in late September and October.  In the labour market, regional divergence had increased:  skill shortages had persisted in parts of the service sector in the south-east of England, but elsewhere prospects had deteriorated.   Inflation Report:  February 1999 66 1 The Committee discussed the prospects for global activity and prices;  slower-than-expected consumption growth;  other indicators of domestic activity;  the mixed signals from the labour market;  monetary conditions and financial market data;  and other issues including tactics;  before turning to the immediate policy decision.  Prior to the meeting, the Committee were briefed orally by Bank staff on the progress of the investigation into the Average Earnings Index, publication of which had been suspended by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) on 2 November 1998. The prospects for global activity and prices 2 Stronger-than-expected data on employment and GDP in the third quarter had suggested that the United States economy continued to be surprisingly robust.  However, expectations  were that US growth would be slower in the coming year.  The Japanese economy had weakened further, with GDP falling in Q3 by 0.7%. 3 In Europe, Japan and the United States, there seemed to be a continuing downward trend in business confidence—despite the strong GDP figures in Germany and the United States.  This might mean that businesses were beginning to feel the trade effects arising from the crises in Asia and other emerging markets.  The declines in business confidence might also reflect a squeeze on profits as weakening world demand had increased competition and contributed to downward pressure on world prices.  Since the previous meeting, the OECD, the World Trade Organisation and the World Bank had revised down their forecasts for world trade in 1999.  Although domestic demand in the industrialised countries remained relatively robust so far, declines in business confidence were consistent with a prospective slowdown in world trade.  It was clear that the expected changes in world trade implied larger current account deficits in the industrialised countries, but it was not clear how these would be spread across countries. 4 Oil and other commodity prices had continued to fall.  The one-month price of Brent crude had fallen below $10 per barrel at the time of the meeting.  Although caused partly by a fall in world demand, the fall in oil prices should act as a positive supply shock to industrialised countries and would therefore be supportive of future activity.  However, the effects could be de-stabilising in the short run:  the terms-of-trade effect would be a significant negative shock for those countries heavily dependent on oil revenues. 5 Although the world financial situation had improved slightly, and backward-looking data for the real economies of the United States and Europe had remained firm, the Committee concluded that the forward indicators of world activity and prices were probably softer than at the time the November Inflation Report projections were finalised. Consumption 6 Consumption growth in Q3 had been below that assumed in the November Inflation Report central projection and retail sales growth suggested that the weakening of consumption growth had thus far continued into Q4.  Looking back at the out-turns for consumption in 1998, growth had been systematically lower than the Committee had expected earlier in the year.  While the forecast errors were within the usual statistical error bands on models of consumption behaviour, it was important to try to understand the possible causes of the apparent slowdown in consumption. 7 The out-turns for consumption growth did not appear to be entirely consistent with its fundamental determinants:  labour income had continued growing strongly and total net wealth had remained high throughout 1998. 8 Leaving aside the possibility of inaccurate data, the Committee discussed a number of potential reasons for the  slower-than-expected consumption growth.  One was that the effects on consumers expenditure of windfall payouts to consumers in 1997, following the conversion of a number of financial institutions from mutual to PLC status, might have been more bunched than expected.  The Bank’s analysis of windfall spending had suggested that some consumers would bring forward their purchases of consumer durables.  If this had distorted the natural replacement cycle, the 1998 data might be reflecting a negative effect as fewer replacement items were purchased. 9 A second possible explanation was that consumers were worried about the outlook for employment and hence had been saving more than had been assumed in the Bank forecast. 10 A third possible explanation was that consumers had not reacted to the measured increases in wealth in the same way as the average of their past responses.  The reaction to an increase in  asset prices, in particular equity prices, might also depend on what had caused the price rise.  Consumers might react differently to changes in the discount rate (the real interest rate appeared to  have fallen) than to changes in expected post-tax corporate earnings.  And changes in discount rates might themselves be a reflection of changing household preferences (because of demographics for example) as between present and future consumption.  Consumers might also have perceived the rise in equity prices to be temporary. 11 It was also possible that the effects of the fiscal tightening might not have been captured fully in earlier forecasts of consumption.  The changes in the last two Budgets had had much of their initial impact on the corporate sector, and hence on the personal sector via its ownership of the corporate sector.  It was difficult to be sure that the tax changes had been properly captured in the relationship between consumption and measured wealth and income. 12 A fifth possible explanation was that weak consumer confidence could lead to a self-fulfilling outcome of weaker demand, which would have the effect of justifying and adding to the initial pessimism. 13 A sixth possible explanation was that consumers might now be more price sensitive and so were waiting for retailers to cut prices further before spending.  For example, the Bank had received anecdotal evidence from the regional Agents that discount clothing stores had been expanding their market share at the expense of traditional established department and chain stores. 14 The Committee considered these possible explanations but concluded that none of the six explanations proposed was sufficient on its own. 15 One of the counterparts to weaker consumption growth had been a bigger-than-expected build-up in inventories.  In the third quarter there had been a marked accumulation of manufacturing inventories of finished goods, while retail inventories had been growing steadily over the year.  The November Inflation Report had already built in a significant negative effect on GDP growth from an inventory cycle during 1999 but the latest data perhaps increased the downside risk to that projection. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 9–10 December 1998  Monetary Policy Committee 67 Other activity indicators 16 GDP growth in Q3 had been revised down from 0.5% to 0.4%.  This was the first quarter of growth clearly below trend since 1996 Q2.  The National Institute of Economic and Social Research’s monthly estimate of GDP was indicating zero growth in the three months to the end of November.  It was, therefore, now possible that the fourth quarter could be even weaker than the Inflation Report central projection of a small positive growth rate. 17 The survey data had continued to deteriorate.  The three surveys from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) for manufacturing, services and construction were now all indicating falls in output.  The Committee noted that the trend in activity growth indicated by the surveys remained downward. Although it was not yet clear whether Q4 growth would be weaker than expected, the downside risks had increased since the Committee’s previous meeting. 18 The Committee considered the possibility that the BRC’s ‘like-for-like’ adjustment was distorting downwards its measure of underlying retail sales growth and that the unadjusted measure (which had been closer to ONS data in recent months) was a better guide.  19 The trade data in Q3 had shown a significant widening of the trade deficit reflecting strong import growth, possibly reflecting the strong investment and inventories numbers.  The Committee was reluctant to read too much into quarterly swings in the external accounts.  The negative effects of weaker world demand and the appreciation of sterling had been clear in the trend for exports for some time. Labour market 20 The labour market quantities data had continued to indicate growth in employment, but at a somewhat slower rate. Unemployment data were beginning to show small increases. Business surveys, such as the CIPS employment survey and the Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services survey, both for November, generally showed a weaker employment picture. 21 Data on pay settlements were relatively stable at around 33/4%.  Wage drift was perhaps more likely to be falling than rising, given the slowdown in output growth.  So, although the labour market remained tight, it was possible that it was no longer tightening and some indicators suggested that it might even be beginning to ease.  On the other hand the Reed Personnel Services skill shortages index showed a further rise for Q4 and official figures on the stock of unfilled vacancies were at a record high. National press advertising had also remained buoyant. 22 The Agents had reported considerable concern amongst contacts about the effects of the Working Time Directive, mainly about the level of bureaucracy and the minimum holiday entitlement.  It was not clear how big an effect the directive would have on costs or prices.  Prices and inflation expectations 23 Inflation forecasts, surveys of financial market professionals and derived inflation expectations from index-linked gilts all seemed to be broadly consistent with the 21/2% RPIX inflation target.  It was possible that surveys of the inflation expectations of the general public, which remained above 21/2%, would decline towards the target as RPI inflation fell relative to RPIX inflation. This reduction in inflation expectations might diminish some of the upside risks to inflation. Monetary conditions 24 Aggregate M4 growth had continued at annual rates of over 9% and the Committee discussed whether it was possible to have low output growth when real broad money was growing so strongly.  Historical evidence suggested that real M4 growth had not always weakened before a slowdown in activity growth, so the Committee could not infer much about the imminent risks to activity.  Furthermore, stripping out the contribution of Other Financial Corporations (OFCs) to broad money growth gave somewhat lower annual growth rates of around 6%. 25 Other monetary and financial indicators had remained firm: notes and coin were growing at over 5% per annum, equity prices had remained at high levels, and house price inflation was easing, but remained at 4.9% and 6.9% per annum on the Halifax and Nationwide measures.  If activity growth continued to slow, one might expect a simultaneous slowdown in broad money growth, possibly alongside a fall in asset prices. 26 On the credit side, there had been few signs of distress borrowing in the corporate sector, and the growth of lending to the personal sector had remained strong—particularly for unsecured credit. The level of interest rates 27 The Committee discussed whether it was helpful to think about the appropriate level of nominal interest rates by reference to the concept of a ‘neutral’ level, which provides neither stimulus nor restraint to the economy.  A broad estimate of the neutral short nominal interest rate could in principle be estimated by combining short-run inflation expectations with an estimate of an average short real interest rate. 28 Inflation expectations appeared to have fallen and it was no longer implausible to think of them as being broadly consistent with the 21/2% target for RPIX inflation.  Some members of the Committee concluded that the appropriate assumption might be a little higher than this given that domestically generated inflation was probably well above 21/2% and was likely to be more persistent than imported inflation. 29 There was more difficulty in estimating the neutral short real rate.  Alternative approaches gave different estimates.  For example, one could use as a guide historical averages of ex post real returns on nominal government bonds, cross-country comparisons, or long-term forward real rates derived from  index-linked gilts.  These gave a range perhaps as wide as 2%–4%. On this basis, estimates of the neutral nominal rate fell in a range of around 41/2% to around 61/2%. 30 While some members of the Committee found the concept of the neutral rate useful in deciding on interest rate policy, other members found the uncertainty surrounding its level so large that the concept was of little use as a practical guide to policy.  Other considerations bearing on the decision this month 31 The Committee noted that much of its concern related to the prospects for consumption growth and confidence.  Since a large share of consumer spending happened around the Christmas period it was possible that a move this month would have a larger effect in supporting activity in the short run than a delayed move, without damaging the prospects for inflation over the medium term. 32 The Committee also discussed the new evidence since the Inflation Report was published.  It was noted that, with the risks on the downside, the mean of the RPIX projection 2 years ahead published in November had already been below 21/2%.  Since then the global situation (including commodity prices) appeared to have weakened further and domestic indicators suggested that the balance of risks to UK activity was even further on the downside,  Inflation Report:  February 1999 68 so that the expected inflation rate two years ahead had fallen since the November Inflation Report. 33 As usual, the Committee considered whether a change in rates would disturb financial markets.  A number of economic commentators were predicting that the Committee would make a cut of 0.25% and many thought a larger cut was warranted.  An immediate cut of 0.50% was within the range of outcomes the market had factored in by the start of the meeting so it was unlikely that a similar size cut would have an unsettling effect.  It was difficult to judge the market consequences of a different decision. The reaction of sterling might depend on whether markets interpreted the change in terms of stronger or weaker prospects for activity growth. The immediate policy decision 34 The Committee concluded that the prospects for global activity and prices had weakened over the month.  Business confidence had been declining across the major economies and commodity prices, particularly oil, had fallen further.  The global financial situation was probably no worse, but UK trade data showed that the effects of slower world demand were beginning to come through on top of the impact of sterling’s appreciation.  The United States and the euro area had both cut rates since the previous MPC meeting.  The main domestic news seemed to be in respect of consumption growth, which had been slower than expected during 1998 as a whole and, on the basis of retail sales growth, was still slowing.  There were a number of possible explanations for this, but none was sufficient on its own. 35 Other indicators of domestic activity also showed a continuing softening.  The CIPS surveys were now indicating negative growth in all the main sectors of the economy.  In contrast, the available data suggested that the labour market remained tight although there were now some signals that the situation might be beginning to ease.  Money growth remained strong and asset prices remained firm.   36 Taking all the news together, the Committee concluded that there was a clear case for a further cut in rates this month.  The question was how much. 37 An argument for a 0.25% cut was identified.  The data might be sufficient to justify a cut of 0.50% but the uncertainty and the remaining upside risks arguably made it slightly preferable to cut by 0.25% this month with another 0.25% to come in January if the analysis was supported by the data. 38 The widely held view was that an immediate cut in rates of 0.50% was justified in terms of incremental news on the month.  In particular the downside risks to both activity and prices appeared to have increased with the unexpected weakness in consumption being a major concern. 39 Some Committee members found it helpful this month to consider where we were in relation to an estimate of the neutral level of nominal rates.  Although subject to a wide range of uncertainty, the neutral rate was likely to be somewhat below the current level of 6.75%.  Therefore a cut of 0.50% this month would be consistent with the news and a step towards neutral. 40 Among those who questioned the practical use of the concept of the neutral rate it was recalled that similar arguments about the level of rates had been used in the mid-eighties to justify lowering rates to levels which subsequently turned out to be too expansionary.  On these grounds one should be cautious about the use of such calculations to justify changes in policy. 41 On another view, a neutral rate would probably be significantly lower than the current rate of 6.75% and the conjuncture indicated that we should be below neutral rather than above.  However, a sequence of cuts would have a greater impact than a single cut of substantially more than 0.50%, which would be seen as an over reaction and might, on this view, be an unnecessary shock to financial markets.  On these grounds an immediate cut of only 0.50% was appropriate. 42 A further view was that there had been a case for cutting by more than 0.50% the previous month and, with the news this month, this suggested that a larger reduction than 0.50% was now appropriate.  Short rates were too high, both in comparison with long rates and compared with short rates in other countries.  On this view, there was no good reason for cutting rates in steps.  The Committee was learning all the time about the response of the economy to shocks and it appeared that the real side of the economy had responded faster to events than the Committee had expected.  On this view there should be an immediate cut of more than 0.50%. 43 The Governor invited members of the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate be cut by 50 basis points to 6.25%.  Eight members of the Committee (the Governor, Mervyn King, David Clementi, Alan Budd, Charles Goodhart, DeAnne Julius, Ian Plenderleith and John Vickers) voted for the proposition.  Willem Buiter voted against, preferring a cut of  75 basis points. 44 The following members of the Committee were present: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Alan Budd Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers 45 Gus O’Donnell was also present as the Treasury representative.  Monetary Policy Committee 69 1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee on 4 December 1998, in advance of its meeting.  At the start of the Committee meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and that information is included in the Annex. I Monetary conditions 2 Notes and coin in circulation had increased by 0.6% in November, after adjusting for the introduction of the new 50 pence and £2 coins.  The twelve-month growth rate had been 5.1%. 3 The twelve-month growth rate of M4 had remained at 9.1% in October and the monthly flow, at £4.9 billion, was close to the average for the first three quarters of 1998.  The entire addition to the stock of M4 had come from the household and Other Financial Corporations (OFC) sectors.  The deposits of Private Non-Financial Corporations (PNFCs) had fallen over the month, by 0.2%. Twelve-month growth rates for the household sector, PNFCs and OFCs had been 5.6%, 5.2% and 22.6% respectively. 4 The one-month growth rate of aggregate M4 lending had remained at 0.7% in October, which pushed the twelve-month change up to 9.1%.  Annual growth in M4 lending to the  household sector had remained unchanged at 7.4% in October. Total secured lending to individuals had continued to grow at an annual rate close to 6%, despite a slowdown in housing market activity;  anecdote suggested that mortgage equity withdrawal might have been a contributory factor.  In contrast, the annual growth in unsecured lending to individuals had remained strong,  at 17.2% in October;  it had been close to this level since the beginning of 1997.  M4 lending to OFCs had increased by 1.3%, raising the annual growth rate to 18.4%.  However, M4 lending  to PNFCs had risen by£0.4 billion, compared with an average  flow of £1.1 billion during the first nine months of the year, reducing the annual growth rate to 5.8%.  PNFCs’ total external finance, which includes foreign currency borrowing and capital issues, remained robust. 5 Net recourse to banks by PNFCs (defined as the difference between M4 lending to PNFCs and their M4 deposits) had also remained strong.  In the year to 1998 Q3, a number of the larger sub-sectors, including manufacturing, had used a greater proportion of the sterling facilities granted to them by banks. 6 Turning to financial prices, it appeared that the 25 basis point cut in official rates in October had already been passed through fully to variable rate mortgages advertised by banks and building societies, and that the 50 basis point cut in official rates in November would, likewise, soon be passed on. 7 Short-term inflation expectations (as surveyed) had remained close to the inflation target, and short-maturity nominal interest rates had fallen.  By implication, there had been a further reduction in short-maturity real interest rates. 8 An empirical analysis of the average real rate earned on a variety of different instruments, in some cases using data back to 1797, suggested a value for the neutral real rate of interest—defined as the rate that would prevail if the economy were at, and set to be at, capacity and inflation was in line with the target—of between 2% and 4%.  Assuming that short-term inflation expectations were close to the inflation target implies a neutral nominal interest rate of between 41/2% and 61/2%. II Demand and output 9 GDP at market prices had grown by 0.4% in 1998 Q3, revised down by 0.1 percentage point from the preliminary estimate, and the annual rate had been revised down to 2.3% from 2.5%.  This was consistent with earlier data on manufacturing output and industrial production, which had pointed to a downward revision.  The expenditure breakdown had shown domestic demand growing by 0.9% in Q3, reflecting a sharp increase in investment. Net trade had made a negative contribution to GDP growth of  0.6 percentage points.  Recent trade data, the scale of the alignment adjustment in the first three quarters of 1998, and the usual revisions reflecting new information had all suggested that the next GDP release could include revisions to the composition of expenditure throughout 1998.  The implications for GDP growth were not clear. 10 Household consumption had remained weak, rising by 0.4%, the same as in Q2.  The Q2 figure had included falls in catering and financial services, which were thought to be erratically weak.  The Q3 release suggested either that the bounceback in these sectors had not been as large as expected, or that other sectors had weakened— so there might have been an underlying slowdown in consumption. Government consumption had risen by 0.6%, compared with 0.9% in the previous quarter. 11 Investment had recovered very strongly following a weak Q2, rising by 2.5% on the quarter.  A fall in manufacturing investment of 4.5% had been more than offset by a rise in service sector investment of 7.4%.  No known erratic components had accounted for the strength of business investment in Q3.  Bank staff had considered whether business surveys might provide an explanation of the current strength of investment, and whether this would be sustained.  Investment intentions did suggest a slightly higher level of investment in Q3, consistent with the provisional estimate.  But the surveys had also suggested the level of investment over the next year would be roughly flat. 12 Inventories had continued to increase in Q3, rising by  £1.7 billion.  There had been a large accumulation of stocks of manufactured finished goods (up £589 million), and retail inventories had risen by more than £250 million for the third successive quarter.  A large increase in stocks of other industries had also pointed towards a significant positive contribution from the alignment adjustment.  Taking the first three quarters of 1998 together, expenditure appeared to have fallen short of output.  Bank calculations suggested that the alignment adjustment had reached around £1.4 billion;  since it must sum to zero over the year, this pointed either to revisions to the first three quarters, or a large negative contribution in Q4.  Looking ahead, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) monthly trends survey had suggested that a stock overhang continued;  the balance reporting excessive stocks was +28 in November.  The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) survey had pointed to falling stocks, though not in the consumer goods sectors. 13 Net trade had made a negative contribution to GDP growth of 0.6% in Q3;  export volumes had fallen by 0.6%, while import volumes had expanded by 1.2%.  But the UK trade data published after the GDP release had pointed to even faster import growth in Q3 (goods volumes had risen by 3.7%), and suggested that a much bigger negative contribution from net trade might be included in the next GDP release (to be published on 21 December).  But this did not necessarily imply a downward revision to Q3 GDP.  In the past year, just under half of the widening of the deficit could be accounted for by a bigger deficit on trade with Asia, including Annex:  Summary of data presented by Bank staff  Inflation Report:  February 1999 70 Japan.  The non-EU trade deficit had narrowed in October, but the trend had remained downward. 14 Manufacturing output had fallen by 0.1% in Q3, while services output had grown by 0.6%, the same as the previous quarter.  Construction output had fallen by 0.7%, owing to a contraction in repairs and maintenance;  new building output had continued to grow.  In October, manufacturing output had contracted by 0.4%—the third consecutive monthly fall.  However, as in the previous few months, industrial production had held up, and was unchanged on the month.  Oil and gas extraction had increased by 0.8%, and utilities supply had remained high, reportedly because of worse-than-usual weather conditions in October. 15 Retail sales volumes had fallen by 0.4% in October, the second consecutive decline.  Survey evidence had continued to point to weaker retail sales.  The CBI Distributive Trades survey had again been weak in November (the balance declined to -9 from -4).  The CBI retailing business confidence indicator had been at its lowest level since the survey began in 1983.  And, the Bank’s regional Agents’ reports suggested falling retail sales turnover in all regions outside Greater London, southern and south east England. At a national level, the Agents’ reports had pointed to an overall fall in turnover in the latest three months.   16 House price inflation had slowed.  The Halifax house price index had risen by 4.9% in the twelve months to November (down from 6.7% in October);  the Nationwide index had risen by 6.9% (down from 7.5% in October);  and the Bank’s index, based on Land Registry data, had declined by 7.5% in the four quarters to Q3, from 8.9% in Q2.  Housing turnover had also slowed— particulars delivered had been 5% lower in October, and the trend had been clearly downwards.  Secured lending had been marginally weaker in October, at £2.1 billion, and the trend in approvals had been downward.  The House Builders’ Federation survey had continued to report negative balances for net reservations (-9) and site visits (-28).   17 The survey evidence had remained weak in November; sentiment towards the domestic outlook had deteriorated further, while export expectations had stabilised somewhat.  The CBI Monthly Industrial Trends survey had reported total orders  balances unchanged at -47, implying a decline in domestic orders, while the balance for export orders improved slightly to -51, from  -55.  Output expectations had improved marginally to -27 in November, from -29 the previous month.  The CIPS manufacturing orders index had reached a record low of 36.4 in November, and its services survey had indicated a contraction in service sector business activity for the first time since the survey began in  July 1996.  III The international economy 18 Economic conditions in Japan had continued to deteriorate. GDP had fallen by 0.7% in Q3 and by 3.6% on a year earlier; however, growth in 1997 had been revised up.  In October, retail sales had fallen 4.8% on a year before, and the unemployment rate had remained at 4.3%.  Reflecting this deteriorating situation, the Japanese government had announced in November a further fiscal package to stimulate domestic demand, reported to include  ¥18 trillion (3.6% of GDP) of extra spending and ¥6 trillion (1.2% of GDP) in tax cuts. 19 In Europe, German GDP had increased by 0.9% in Q3 (2.7% on a year before), and French GDP was up by 0.5% (2.8% on a year before).  In both countries import growth had slowed.  Survey data for the prospective euro area indicated that, between September and October, industrial confidence had fallen from a balance of -2 to -5, while the balance for consumer confidence had picked up from -5 to -3.  Average inflation had remained subdued in October, at 1.0%. 20 In contrast, activity in the United States had generally turned out to be stronger than expected.  The second estimate of Q3 GDP had shown a rise of 1.0% on a quarter ago (revised up from 0.8%). In October, annual M2 money growth had increased to 8.5%, up from 7.9% in September, and retail sales were 5.7% higher than a year ago.  In November, non-farm payrolls had increased by 267,000, well above the average monthly rise of 189,000 in  June-October, and the Conference Board Index of consumer confidence had increased to 126.0, from 119.3 in October. However, annual average hourly wage growth had fallen from 3.8% in October to 3.7% in November, and the twelve-month growth in industrial production had fallen to 2.1% in October—the lowest annual growth rate since the 1991 recession. 21 The OECD, World Bank, and World Trade Organisation (WTO) had all released new forecasts during the month.  In each case projections for world GDP and trade growth in 1998 had been revised down.  World trade growth was expected to slow from 9.5% in 1997 to 5.3% (World Bank), 4.6% (OECD), and 4.5% (WTO).  Thereafter trade growth was expected to increase.  Other forecasters had also revised down output growth projections.  Bank staff had used UK export trade shares to weight together the 1999 GDP growth forecasts, compiled by Consensus Economics Inc., for the major six (M6) economies (US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Canada).  This forecast indicator of M6 GDP growth had fallen from 2.4% in July to 1.9% in November.  On the same basis, consensus forecasts for M6 CPI inflation in 1999 had been revised down from 1.6% to 1.3%. IV Labour market 22 Labour Force Survey (LFS) employment had grown by 124,000 (0.5%) in the three months to September, compared with the previous three months.  This rise was concentrated in full-time employee positions:  full-time employment had increased by 158,000, and the number of employees by 199,000 (0.8%).  In contrast, the number of self-employed workers had fallen by 79,000 (2.4%), and part-time employment dropped by 34,000.  Total hours worked were only 0.1% higher over the quarter, implying that hours per head had fallen by 0.4%.  23 Business surveys had suggested a weaker employment picture than the LFS data.  The composite CIPS measure of employment had shown a sharp deterioration in job growth through 1998 Q3, with the survey indicating falls in overall private sector employment in October and November.  At the sectoral level, the CIPS November survey reported that manufacturing employment had continued to decline sharply, and that construction employment was now starting to fall, whereas services employment had continued to expand, albeit at a markedly slower rate.  This sectoral picture had been broadly corroborated by the reports of the Bank’s regional Agents.  The Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services (FRES) report had shown a modest decline in permanent recruitment business in November, whereas temporary postings had still been rising, although at a slightly slower rate.  It also reported that the availability of staff to take up positions had improved in November. 24 Vacancies at job centres had remained at historically high levels.  Notifications of new vacancies had increased by 14,000 in October, and the stock of unfilled vacancies had risen by 10,000 to a record level.  However, the government’s initiative for job centres to improve the marketing of their services, including the introduction of Saturday opening, may have partly explained these high levels.  National press advertising had also been buoyant, but had shown signs of flattening off in recent months.  25 LFS unemployment had increased by 3,000 in the three months to September, compared with the previous three months. Short-term unemployment (duration under twelve months) had increased by 44,000, but this had been almost entirely offset by a decline in the numbers unemployed for more than one year.  The  Monetary Policy Committee 71 LFS unemployment rate had been unchanged at 6.2%.  LFS figures showed that there had been a fall of 87,000 in the number of economically inactive people in the three months to September, which contrasted with the increases that had been recorded in the first half of the year. 26 Claimant-count unemployment had risen by 7,000 in October, following a revised fall of 4,100 in September.  October’s data had possibly been affected by seasonal adjustment problems following the introduction of the Jobseeker’s Allowance, offsetting the distortion to July’s figures.  Taking this into account, the trend for falling unemployment had probably continued.  Evidence had started to emerge of an impact from the New Deal, as participants had left the Gateway.  There was no firm indication that increased redundancies had yet affected the claimant count.  Inflow rates to the count remained low by historic standards, while LFS data suggested that redundancies during summer 1998 had been at similar levels to the previous two years. 27 Turning to skill shortages, the Bank’s regional Agents had reported some easing of recruitment difficulties, though the level had remained higher than normal, and regional and industrial variations persisted.  Sectoral surveys generally supported this picture.  As well as the CBI manufacturing survey and the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) surveys reported a month ago, the CBI/Price Waterhouse survey had also found some easing in recruitment difficulties in Q3.  However, skills shortages in construction had continued to rise, according to the Confederation of Master Builders survey, and Reed Personnel Services had also reported more severe skill shortages.    28 The rebased earnings data had been suspended by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on 2 November, and were the subject of an independent review.  In October, the Bank’s measure of the whole-economy employment-weighted mean wage settlement (twelve-month moving average) had remained at 3.7% for the sixth consecutive month.  Private sector settlements had been unchanged at 4.0% in October, and public settlements at 3.3%.  Using a matched sample (ie only including firms where data are available for both years), the mean settlement had increased to an annual rate of 3.8% for the four months to October 1998, from 3.4% one year earlier, similar to the pattern in the whole-economy twelve-month measure.  Other evidence suggested that broader earnings pressures may have moderated;  the Reward Index of earnings growth had declined to 5.0% in October, from 5.4% in June, and the Bank’s regional Agents had reported falls in overtime and hours worked, which would lower wage drift. V Prices 29 Commodity prices had fallen again:  the Bank’s sterling  oil-inclusive index had fallen by 15.9% since October 1997, the sharpest annual deflation rate recorded since the index started in January 1992.  Excluding oil, the Bank’s index had fallen by 8.7%. This was broadly in line with the Economist Index in October (in both sterling and dollar terms) which showed that prices had fallen by 16.1% and 17.5% respectively.  The one-month future price of Brent crude had declined by nearly 20% during November, and had reached $9.98 per barrel at the close of business on 9 December. However, RPI petrol prices were unlikely to fall by the same percentage amount, because of the effects of taxes, excise duties and the potential for retailers to widen their margins. 30 Producer prices had also remained weak:  annual input  price inflation had fallen to -9.8% in October, and annual output price inflation, excluding taxes, had reached -0.7%—its lowest  rate on record.  Surveys had suggested that producer price inflation may fall further:  both the CIPS indicator of manufacturing  input prices and the CBI series of output prices reached all-time lows in November.  Annual trade price inflation had remained negative, with export prices to the world unchanged in September, and import prices 0.7% lower (the corresponding figures for  non-EU trade prices in October were -1.1% and -0.7% respectively). 31 Other measures of inflation had also fallen since the November MPC meeting.  Annual inflation, as measured by the retail sales deflator, had fallen to 0.7% in October, its lowest rate since May 1997.  And the annual inflation rate of harmonised consumer prices had fallen by 0.2 percentage points to 1.3%, equalling its lowest rate on record.  The GDP deflator had only increased by 1.8% in the year to the third quarter. 32 RPIX inflation had remained at target for the third consecutive month in October.  Both RPI and RPIY inflation had fallen slightly since September, to 3.1% and 1.8% respectively. RPIY goods inflation had continued to fall, and had become (marginally) negative for the first time in October. VI Financial markets Foreign exchange 33 Sterling and the dollar had strengthened during most of the month, though both had fallen more recently.  Developments in Latin America had been an important influence for the dollar. Looking toward the end of the year, a number of contacts suggested that sterling might be volatile around that time, associated with the move from the ecu to the euro, although there was little sign of this yet. 34 Within Europe, the process of short-term interest rate convergence ahead of the introduction of the euro was almost complete.  The co-ordinated interest rate cut in Europe on  3 December took all prospective euro countries’ short-term interest rates to 3%, except Italy, where the discount rate was reduced to 3.5%. 35 The sterling ERI had appreciated by 0.3% during the month, to 99.6 on 9 December.  It was little changed against the dollar and Deutsche Mark at $1.66 and DM 2.77 respectively.  While some of the news during the month had been negative for sterling (the larger-than-expected repo rate cut;  the release of the MPC minutes; some weaker-than-expected macroeconomic data) the pound had, until recently, appreciated steadily against the Deutsche Mark, supported by merger and acquisition activity.  The path implied by an uncovered interest parity condition under constant UK nominal interest rates was very close to the central projection in the November Inflation Report. Government bond and money markets 36 Short-term interest rate expectations had fallen during the month, particularly in the final few days of November and early December.  The gilt-edged market had been stronger than overseas bond markets, with a sharp fall in gilt yields.  Ten-year gilt redemption yields had fallen by about 55 basis points during the month and, at 4.50%, were now just below those in the United States, though higher than those in Germany (3.77%).  There had been a number of reasons for gilts’ outperformance during the month:  weaker macroeconomic survey data;  the larger-than-expected UK repo rate cut;  the MPC minutes and TSC evidence, which together were interpreted as suggesting greater willingness by MPC to cut rates for a given economic outlook than the market had thought;  and also strong institutional demand for gilts ahead of the payment of gilt coupons on 7 December.  This last factor suggests that the decline in yields was not solely attributable to interest rate expectations. 37 Short-term interest rate expectations, as measured by short sterling futures, had fallen.  Since the November MPC, rate expectations had declined by 22 basis points according to the December 1998 short sterling futures contract.  Further along the curve, expectations had fallen by around 40 basis points.  But rate  Inflation Report:  February 1999 72 expectations for the end of 1999 had risen, owing to concerns about liquidity at the end of that year and in early 2000.  The behaviour of very short-term interest rates suggested that the market expected a cut in the repo rate on 10 December, but this might be exaggerated by year-end demand for gilts on repo. Equity and corporate debt markets 38 Equity prices had initially strengthened in the first half of November but had fallen back toward the end of the month.  Since the previous MPC, the Standard and Poor’s composite share index had reached a new high, but the FT-SE All-Share index had  been unchanged at 2586, with declines again in the General Industrials sector and the Resources sector.  There had been more company profit warnings in November than in the same month a year earlier.  Analysts’ forecasts of corporate earnings growth  for this financial year had been revised down again, to under 1%, but the fall in the risk free real interest rate was an offsetting influence on share prices.  The recent rise in the Japanese equity market probably largely reflected the global recovery in equity markets. 39 In the capital markets, corporate bond yields had fallen during the month over a range of credit ratings, and international bond and syndicated loan issuance by UK corporates had increased since August (usually a quiet month).  UK corporate bond spreads (over the gilt yield curve) had fallen some ten to fifteen basis points across the board.  However, while short maturity sterling swap spreads had also narrowed, ten-year spreads increased by around  13 basis points.  Real yields on UK corporate debt had changed little during the month.  In October, PNFCs total external financing, which measures their new borrowing from all sources and in all currencies, had turned out broadly in line with the average for the past six months. VII Reports by the Bank’s regional Agents 40 The Bank’s regional Agencies had contacted 162 companies from the manufacturing, retail, other services and construction sectors to investigate the reported sharp deterioration in survey measures of business optimism.  They had sought to discover whether the factors that most influenced optimism had been  firm-specific, industry/sector-specific, or related to general economic factors.  This survey had been conducted after the  50 basis point interest rate cut in November.  Nonetheless, the Agents confirmed that overall business optimism had been lower than three months ago;  more than half the manufacturers and retailers, and over a third of the construction and other service sector companies, had been less optimistic.  The survey had found that, independent of a firm’s own performance, companies attached considerable weight to general UK and global economic news when gauging their optimism.  Respondents said the November interest rate cut had positively influenced their optimism, but had been outweighed by other news.  The Agents had reported widespread concern about prospects for global economic growth. However, concern about future demand and output had now become focused more on domestic considerations.   41 The Agents had also reported the results of more general discussions with their contacts.  Economic conditions were largely seen as unchanged from a month earlier.  With the exception of the West Midlands and North East, most respondents felt that talk of a recession had been overdone.  Nevertheless, uncertainty about future prospects had continued to dampen demand.  Although the recent cuts in interest rates had been welcomed, most consumers and firms seemed to be waiting for further reductions before undertaking major purchase and investment decisions. 42 As had been evident in the ONS data, the economic slowdown had not been evenly distributed across industrial sectors. Contacts in the services sector had reported reasonable growth in demand, albeit with some signs of weakness;  retailers generally had only modest expectations for the Christmas period.  Conditions in the manufacturing sector had been widely reported as being difficult, with weak order books for the first half of 1999.  Demand for manufacturing output had fallen, while trading conditions had become more competitive owing to sterling’s appreciation and increased import penetration.  43 The automobile sector had been especially hard hit.  Global oversupply, falling demand for new cars, and the adverse competitiveness effect of sterling’s appreciation had created particularly difficult conditions for UK automobile producers. This, in turn, had reduced demand for the large number of firms who supply parts and services to car manufacturers.  The Agents reported that firms had cut costs in response to these pressures, and that this had included some job losses. 44 Respondents generally had noted that while labour market conditions had remained tight, conditions had begun to ease.  In particular, wage pressures had diminished somewhat, with most wage settlements at, or below, the RPI inflation rate.  Monetary Policy Committee 73 The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee today voted to reduce the Bank’s repo rate by 0.50% to 6.25%. Since the November Inflation Report, the prospect for global activity appears to have weakened and commodity prices have fallen further.  In the UK, GDP growth in the third quarter was revised down, and surveys of activity have continued to indicate a deterioration across the economy, although the labour market is still tight and monetary and financial indicators remain relatively strong.  The Monetary Policy Committee judged that the downside risks to both activity and inflation have increased, and therefore reduced interest rates by 0.50% to keep prospective inflation on track to meet the 2.5% target. The minutes of the meeting will be published at 9.30 am on Wednesday 23 December. Text of Bank of England press notice of 10 December 1998 Bank of England reduces interest rates by 0.50% to 6.25%  Inflation Report:  February 1999 74 Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 6–7 January 1999 1 Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed the prospects for global activity and prices given continued downward revisions to published forecasts; exchange rates and financial markets;  money and credit;  demand and output in the context of the National Accounts revisions;  the labour market;  and other issues including tactics.  The prospects for global activity and prices 2 A key issue remained how much of a depressing influence the international economy would have on the domestic economy, and hence on the prospects for UK inflation.  The outlook for the world economy had clearly deteriorated over recent months, and this had been a material factor in the Committee’s decisions to reduce rates in October, November and December.  Views varied on whether there had been much sign of a further international deterioration over the past month, or whether international developments had principally reflected the continuing pass-through and unwinding of previous negative shocks to demand in the world economy.   3 Some outside forecasts of world trade were being revised down further—for example, the IMF had updated its WEO projections in December.  The latest Consensus Economics survey showed that forecasts for Germany and other euro-area economies had been revised down in December.  Over the past month business confidence in the euro area had continued to weaken.  The Japanese economy continued to deteriorate.  The Tankan survey had weakened further, returning to the very low level recorded in 1994. The latest indicators for the United States continued to be quite strong, and the Consensus Economics survey showed that some growth forecasts for 1999 had been revised up in December.  It was also necessary to take account of the easing of policy in the United States and in the euro area since the autumn and the effects were unlikely to have been seen in the official data yet.  Overall, the situation in the major industrial countries was not obviously worse than a month ago, but was no better than expected.   4 Some of the forward-looking indicators in the United States—such as the National Association of Purchasing Managers index—were a little weaker.  This weakening, in common with that in other OECD countries, perhaps related more to the manufacturing rather than service sectors of the economy.  Though it seemed likely that robust US growth would continue over the next two or three quarters, there was a risk of a substantial slowdown looking further ahead.  One possibility was a weakening of demand, if for example there were an adjustment of equity prices;  another possibility was that supply constraints would begin to slow growth, although there were few signs of that in the current price and cost data.  5 Non-oil commodity prices had risen slightly in November, following the fall in the previous month.  But despite the military action in the Gulf, the fall in world oil prices to around $10 per barrel that had occurred prior to the December meeting had largely persisted.  For the world as a whole there had been a negative shock to aggregate demand following the crisis in East Asia and the Russian financial problems, so that it was likely that demand had fallen further below capacity, putting downward pressure on world prices and possibly real interest rates.  Commodity prices had been especially sensitive to this shock.  For the United Kingdom, goods price inflation excluding taxes was currently running significantly below aggregate RPIX inflation, given falls in the price of tradeables and the effect of past tax increases.  6 The external environment would be a key consideration in the quarterly Inflation Report forecast round.  The risks to both inflation and real activity remained clearly on the downside, and might have increased.  The Committee discussed the risks and possible ramifications of further serious problems in emerging market economies, and agreed that policy could react if these downside risks materialised. Exchange rates and financial markets 7 The sterling effective exchange rate had appreciated a little prior to Christmas, but had depreciated slightly at the turn of the year.  The Bank had monitored the introduction of the euro, which had gone smoothly, and the Committee agreed that this did not, for the time being, have any material implications for the outlook for inflation and the conduct of monetary policy in the United Kingdom. 8 The yield on index-linked government debt had continued to fall, and was now around 2% at a maturity of ten years.  Real yields were now at their lowest level since such bonds were introduced in the United Kingdom in 1981.  Regulatory changes for pension funds that came into force in April 1997—namely the minimum funding requirement—may have made it more attractive for them to hold index-linked debt relative to some other assets.  But the effects of these changes were likely to be spread over a number of years following the initial announcement, and it seemed unlikely that this could explain the very recent fall in UK real yields.  There had been a corresponding fall in long-term nominal yields:  implied inflation expectations remained broadly unchanged over the recent past.  It was not clear what had caused the fall in UK long-term real interest rates, and therefore what the consequences would be for the economy.  Although it was difficult to explain the fall in long-term real yields in the United Kingdom relative to overseas, it was noted that there had been a general decline in global real yields over the past year.  One possible explanation of the most recent fall was linked to the downward shock to world demand, which might imply a reduction in the real rate of interest that would balance global saving and investment. 9 Most major international stock markets had risen over the past month, and the FT-SE All-Share index was 13% above the level assumed in the November Inflation Report central projection.  It was difficult to explain fully the rise in equity prices, but it was possible that it was related to the fall in real interest rates. 10 The spreads of yields on UK corporate bonds over government bond yields remained higher than they had been prior to the shocks of summer 1998.  But the level of nominal yields on these bonds had fallen over the same period.   Money and credit 11 The growth rate of notes and coin had been robust through the autumn, even after adjusting for the introduction of the £2 coin. This added weight to the picture painted by the official retail sales figures, which had been stronger than much of the survey evidence had suggested.  The provisional December figure for notes and coin had been particularly strong, but this could not sensibly be assessed in isolation because of the uncertainty surrounding the seasonal adjustment to the Christmas month figures. 12 Aggregate M4 growth had slowed in November, and had been matched by slower growth of lending.  The slowdown in the growth of M4 and M4 lending was in large part accounted for by a reduction in the stocks of deposits and outstanding loans held by other financial corporations (OFCs).  Within OFCs there had been anecdotal evidence that securities dealers, in particular, had been contracting their balance sheets by more than normal towards the  Monetary Policy Committee 75 end of 1998.  This was consistent with some of the data (for example, the fall in sterling lending by the major British banks to securities dealers).   13 Overall, some members thought that the latest monetary data were consistent with a gradual slowing of demand. 14 Lending to households continued to be robust, and had grown by 71/2% in the year to November.  This did not seem to be significantly out of line with nominal consumption growth. However, the high rate of increase in the smaller non-secured component of lending (which accounted for around 20% of the stock) continued to be puzzling. 15 Bank lending to companies had continued to grow steadily. Bond issuance had been low at the end of 1998.  But it usually was at that time of year, so underlying conditions were difficult to assess.  The number of insolvencies had risen but from a relatively low level.  The Committee concluded, as in previous months, that recent indicators did not suggest a material impairment of the supply of credit. Demand and output 16 Although there had been no change to the estimate of GDP growth in the third quarter of 1998, there had been revisions both to the composition of GDP growth in Q3, and to its rate of growth in earlier quarters.  The level of output was now around 0.2% lower than previously estimated, so pressure on capacity was likely to have been a little less than previously thought, all other things being equal.  The three measures of GDP—income, expenditure and output—were diverging and that made it more difficult to judge the pace at which the economy was growing.  Within the Q3 GDP figures, growth of final domestic demand had been revised down and the contribution from net trade and inventory building had been revised up.  In particular, consumption growth had been revised down, and the pattern was of a more gradual slowdown over the past year than had previously been estimated.  Consumer confidence remained weak. 17 With the exception of the mortgage lending figures, the indicators suggested that housing market activity was slowing. Particulars delivered were now quite low compared with the past. The Halifax house price index had recorded a fall in prices for the second successive month.  One view was that this provided further evidence of a loss of consumer confidence over the summer. However, the housing market was sensitive to interest rates, so a degree of slowing was to be expected following the tightening of monetary policy through 1997 and the first half of 1998.  And members agreed that the relatively moderate rate of house price inflation over the past year was a welcome sign of greater stability than in past cycles. 18 The contribution of stockbuilding to GDP growth had been revised up in the third quarter of 1998, but there had been a downward revision to stock levels.  In particular, stocks of finished manufactures had been revised down significantly.  However, there seemed to be little news overall in the revisions to aggregate inventories, some of which reflected statistical changes in the National Accounts.  Nonetheless, the balance of risks remained that the build up in inventories would be unwound by more than expected.  19 The CBI Distributive Trades survey for December was less weak than the previous month’s survey, but this news was probably offset by the weaker CIPS services survey.  It was too soon to glean any reliable impression of the state of consumer spending over the Christmas/New Year period.  Overall, the latest evidence from surveys and monthly indicators did not suggest that the latest best estimate for GDP growth in the fourth quarter was very different from that in the central projection in the November Inflation Report. Labour market 20 The labour market data continued to show rising employment and falling inactivity.  But there were now further indications that unemployment was probably no longer falling.  The recent data had shown a fall in long-term unemployment more than offset by a rise in short-term unemployment.  The three CIPS surveys for manufacturing, services and construction were now all pointing to falling employment.    21 The number of jobs recorded by the ONS Workforce survey had been revised up by 450,000 implying lower productivity and higher unit labour costs data.  The Committee noted that its November Inflation Report projections had been based on the Labour Force Survey measure of employment, which was not affected by this revision. 22 The Committee thought that the labour market remained tight, but that it seemed to have reached a turning point, and there were some signs of an easing of labour market pressures from the indicators of skill shortages and signs on pay settlements.  The twelve-month employment-weighted average of pay settlements had been flat for many months and, depending on wage drift, this suggested a somewhat more benign path for earnings growth than had been expected around six months ago given the apparent tightening of the labour market.  The Bank’s regional Agents had reported some easing of upward pressure on pay growth.  The current level of settlements was not especially comforting given the normal level of pay drift, but with the economy slowing members thought that there should be reduced pressure on pay from this source.  And the reduction in interest rates over recent months would tend to lower RPI inflation relative to the target measure of RPIX in the short-term, which might influence settlements in coming months.  Inflation expectations were important for wage setting, and had fallen in the latest surveys.  These expectations might also be better anchored, following the monetary policy regime change, than had been the case in the past. 23 According to the National Accounts estimate of wages and salaries per head, nominal growth had fallen to 4.4% in the year to Q3.  Estimates of the real wage paid by producers—based on the GDP deflator at basic prices—showed that the rate of growth was still rising, and was consistent with past tightening of the labour market.  However, the rate of increase of the real wage received  by workers had been decreasing during 1998.  The wedge of over two percentage points between the two measures could be explained by past increases in taxes and changes in employers’ contributions. 24 The Committee noted that their assumption for earnings growth in 1999 used in the November Inflation Report central projection was towards the top end of the range of outside forecasts made in November and December, and agreed that it would return to the issue in its discussion of the forecast for the February Inflation Report. Other considerations bearing on the decision this month 25 There were a number of reasons for expecting significant news over the next month.  A large share of consumer spending happened around the Christmas period, and at the time of the January meeting the official estimate of retail sales in December was not available.  But given the difficulty in seasonally adjusting the data at this time of the year, it would be some time before the full picture became clear.  The first estimate of Q4 GDP would also become available by the time of the February meeting.  In addition, it would be possible to observe the first settlements relating to January, which is an important month for pay agreements. Furthermore, it was still early to assess the impact of the introduction of the euro.   Inflation Report:  February 1999 76 The immediate policy decision 26 The Committee concluded that the prospects for global activity and prices were as bad as expected a month ago, and that the risks remained clearly on the downside.  Some Committee members thought that these risks had increased somewhat in the past month, and that it seemed likely that the adjustment of the world economy to past demand shocks would prove more prolonged than some forecasts currently assumed. 27 The main domestic news on the real side of the economy had been the small downward revision to the level of GDP and the change in the composition of GDP growth, especially the downward revision to consumption.  On the other hand the recent news on retail sales was mixed, while the data on notes and coin, and world stock markets pointed to a stronger outlook for activity. And some of the surveys were perhaps not as weak as they had been a month ago.  Nonetheless, recent indicators suggested that GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 1998 would turn out broadly as expected at the time of the November Report.  The labour market remained tight, but seemed to have reached a turning point. 28 Given the picture for activity, nominal price and cost developments continued to be more benign than expected at the time of the November projections and, on the view of some members, than expected in December.  The fall in the oil price in November had largely persisted through December.  Producer input prices had continued to fall.  Evidence from wage settlements and the Bank’s regional Agents suggested an easing of upward pressures on the rate of increase of pay. 29 On one view, given that there was not much news on the month, there was merit in waiting to gather another month’s evidence and for the quarterly Inflation Report.  The coming month would see some important data on Q4 GDP and settlements, and it was possible that the outcome of the Average Earnings Index review would be known.  There were just enough signs of continuing demand growth in the recent data for the next month’s data to be important to the policy decision.  The quarterly forecasting round would provide an opportunity to reassess the level of interest rates.  On balance, there was a case for pausing and making no change in interest rates this month.  If in the event the evidence warranted it, a larger reduction in rates could be made next month. 30 Members identified several possible reasons for an immediate reduction in rates.  The adjustment in the world economy was likely to prove more prolonged than previously assumed, with external demand for UK goods and services through 2000 correspondingly weaker.  If so, there was less need for policy to put downward pressure on domestically generated inflation.  In addition, the November Inflation Report central projection had also assumed robust real earnings growth and consumption.  The revisions to the expenditure composition of domestic demand, together with the potential easing in the labour market and the apparent moderation of inflation expectations, suggested that the prospects for inflation looked weaker.  A combination of these external and domestic factors suggested that a reduction in rates of 0.25% (or possibly more in the view of some) was now warranted. If a reduction of 0.25% to interest rates were made at the January meeting it was difficult to see that being inappropriate by the time of the February meeting.  The probability of a reversal in rates seemed small, and reversals justified by economic news were anyway not problematic. 31 Another view was that a cut of 0.75% would have been preferable at the time of the December meeting on the basis of the news available then.  With little, if any, news during the past month, a reduction of 0.25% was still needed, and should be made now. 32 Another view was that a reduction of 0.25% would still leave rates above their neutral level, which was too high in the context of the current conjuncture.  So the issue was how fast to reduce rates. There were three reasons for moving in steps rather than in one large reduction.  First, a series of reductions might have a greater impact on consumer and business sentiment.  Second, it might allow the Committee to learn more about the way the economy was responding to past shocks and policy changes.  Third, it was important not to out-pace significantly the expectations of financial markets, as this could have unwanted consequences for asset prices and the exchange rate.  Even though it was appropriate to move in a series of steps, the current level of rates was sufficiently above the rate required at this point in the cycle that a reduction of 0.50% was needed now. 33 The Governor invited members of the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate be cut by 0.25% to 6.0%. Seven members of the Committee (the Governor, Mervyn King, David Clementi, Alan Budd, Willem Buiter, Charles Goodhart and John Vickers) voted for the proposition, and two (DeAnne Julius and Ian Plenderleith) voted against.  DeAnne Julius preferred an immediate cut of 0.50%, and Ian Plenderleith preferred to maintain the Bank’s repo rate at 6.25%. 34 The following members of the Committee were present: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Alan Budd Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers 35 Gus O’Donnell was present as the Treasury representative.  Monetary Policy Committee 77 1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by the Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee on 4 January 1999, in advance of its meeting on 6 January 1999.  At the start of the Committee meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and that information is included in the Annex. I Monetary conditions 2 Notes and coin had risen in December by 1.2%.  The  twelve-month growth rate had increased by 0.6 percentage points to 5.7%.  Seasonal factors were typically harder to establish in the Christmas period, making the December data especially hard to interpret. 3 The monthly flow of M4 in November, at £2.1 billion, was well below the average over the rest of 1998, and the twelve-month growth rate had fallen to 8.3%, the lowest since July 1995.  This was largely accounted for by a £0.7 billion decline in Other Financial Corporations’ (OFCs’) balances in November and a slightly lower rate of increase of Household sector deposits.  The deposits of Private Non-Financial Corporations (PNFCs) had risen strongly in November, following a small fall in October.  Taking the two months together, PNFCs’ deposits in October and November were in line with the 1998 average.  4 The increase of £1.8 billion in M4 lending in November was the lowest since December 1996.  The sectoral pattern largely mirrored that on the deposits side:  OFCs had made a net repayment of £4.0 billion in November while PNFCs borrowing had increased quite sharply, to £1.9 billion.  Anecdotal evidence suggested that the OFC sector may have chosen to shrink balance sheets by more than has been typical ahead of the year-end.  Major British Banks’ lending to securities dealers had fallen by £1.5 billion in November, consistent with that interpretation. 5 Households’ borrowing had remained steady in November at £3.0 billion, and the twelve-month growth rate was still 7.4%, around 0.5 percentage points higher than at the start of 1998.  There had been no slowdown on the month in secured borrowing or the number of loan approvals for house purchase.  Unsecured credit growth had remained strong:  the comprehensive measure of unsecured credit, which includes lending by non-M4 institutions, had increased by 17.3% on a year earlier. 6 Net external finance raised by PNFCs had risen by £1.4 billion to £4.4 billion in November.  This included an increase in PNFCs net recourse to banks and a reduction in net capital issues. As for capital market conditions, the spread between swaps and government debt, and between corporate bonds and government debt, had both been broadly constant during December.  These spreads remained high by historic standards but were below the peaks observed in the autumn. 7 Turning to price indicators of monetary conditions, the  50 basis point cut in official rates in November had already been fully passed through to variable-rate mortgages advertised by banks and building societies;  announcements had been made by lenders that the 50 basis point cut in official rates in December would soon be passed on. 8 Survey measures of short-run inflation expectations had fallen by between 10 and 20 basis points during November, lying largely in a range between 2.2%–2.3%.  These surveys had predominantly been undertaken before the reduction in official interest rates on 10 December.  Measures of professionals’ expectations of average annual inflation over the next two years, derived from Consensus Economics and Basix surveys, had fallen by between 25 and 50 basis points on a quarter earlier.  Estimates of short real interest rates could be made by subtracting survey measures of inflation expectations from a corresponding maturity wholesale money market rate.  These calculations suggested that short real rates had fallen again during November, by around  20 basis points.  Estimates of average real interest rates over the next two years derived from the Consensus survey enabled international comparisons to be made;  they suggested that over Q4 real rates had fallen by substantially more in the United Kingdom (around 60 basis points) compared with either the United States (around 15 basis point fall) or Germany (around 30 basis point fall). 9 The Basix general public’s inflation expectations for the next two years had also fallen markedly over Q4.  The mean inflation expectations for one year ahead had fallen from 4.5% to 4.2% over the quarter.  Expected inflation two years ahead had fallen from 5.1% to 4.7% over the quarter.  There had also been a shift in the distribution of inflation expectations away from 4% or above, to 3% or below.  The expectations of inflation formed by the general public still remained well above other measures. II Demand and output 10 According to the National Accounts release, GDP at market prices had grown by an unrevised 0.4% in 1998 Q3 on a quarter earlier, and by 2.3% at an annual rate.  But downward revisions to growth in 1997 and the first half of 1998 had reduced the level of GDP by around £350 million (or 0.2%).  There had been revisions to the expenditure composition of growth in Q3, with a slightly stronger contribution from net trade offsetting weaker domestic demand.  And the divergence between the output and expenditure measures of GDP had widened markedly to £865 million, compared with almost zero in 1997 Q3. 11 Household consumption growth in Q3 had been revised down from 0.4% to 0.3%.  Within this, service sector spending had grown by 1.4%, but expenditure on both non-durable and durable goods had fallen.  Analysis by Bank staff suggested that part of the recent decline in durables spending might reflect the unwinding of unusually high spending in 1997 and the start of 1998.  This high spending had perhaps been caused by building society windfalls, though this effect appeared to have been rather smaller than expected and had been contrasted with a marked weakening in the growth of consumption of non-durables since 1996. 12 Investment growth in Q3 had been revised down from 2.5% to 1.1%, but the level of investment had been revised up by 0.6%, reflecting new information about investment in previous quarters. (Business investment had been revised up by 2.8%).  These upwards revisions had been concentrated in the private services sectors, and mainly reflected increased spending on machinery and equipment. 13 A rise in inventories—most marked in the manufacturing and retail sectors—had contributed 0.2% to GDP growth in Q3. But the cumulative increase in stocks through 1998 as a whole had been revised down by around £1.8 billion.  It was possible that there was now less of an overhang in stocks than previously thought.  But interpretation was complicated by the fact that the reduction had largely reflected a reallocation out of the alignment adjustment and into the statistical discrepancy.  Evidence from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) monthly Industrial Trends survey suggested that manufacturers’ stocks had risen further above desired levels in Q4. Annex:  Summary of data presented by Bank staff  Inflation Report:  February 1999 78 14 Government consumption growth had been revised down by 0.4 percentage points in Q3 to 0.2% and by 0.5 percentage points in Q2 to 0.4%. 15 The current account had been in surplus by £2.3 billion in Q3, but this was accounted for by a large surplus on investment income, reflecting losses on overseas investments by foreign-owned financial institutions based in the United Kingdom.  Net trade had continued to deteriorate, making a -0.5 percentage point contribution to GDP growth in Q3 (revised up slightly from  -0.6 percentage points).  This fourth consecutive quarterly negative contribution had reflected a rise in the deficit on trade in goods to the highest level since 1990 Q2.  Trade in services had continued to provide a small positive contribution to GDP growth, despite a fall in services exports, as lower spending abroad by UK residents had reduced services imports.  Net trade in goods appeared to have weakened further in Q4:  exports to the non-EU had fallen by 1.9% in November and imports had risen by 2.2%.  But the deficit with the EU had remained broadly stable. 16 Retail sales had risen by 0.8% in November, in contrast to the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and CBI Distributive Trades surveys which had indicated a continuing decline.  Part of the difference might be explained by the broader sample used by the ONS.  On an annual basis, comparing the three months to November with the same period a year ago, retail sales had grown by 2.6%, closer to the BRC’s total sales volume measure, but still rather stronger than the CBI survey.  Consumer confidence had remained weak:  the GfK index had fallen back in December from  -5.8% to -6.9%, and the MORI balance had been -30 in November. Most indicators had suggested a continued moderation in the housing market.  Compared with a year earlier, the Nationwide house price index had grown by 7% in December;  and the Halifax index had grown by 4.6%;  particulars delivered had fallen to 103,000 in November—the lowest for over two years—and the House Builders Federation survey of new house building had remained weak. 17 Manufacturing output had fallen by 0.4% in October, the third consecutive monthly fall.  Lower demand in domestic markets had appeared to be the main reason for lower car production and engineering new orders.  Both the CBI and British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) surveys had pointed to a fall in manufacturing output in Q4 as a whole.  But there was some evidence from the CBI and Chartered Institute of Purchasing Supply (CIPS) surveys that the pace of decline had bottomed out.  Growth rates derived from the BCC survey for Q3 suggested that service sector output had grown at around trend in Q4, but the CIPS survey had pointed to a fall in service sector activity in December for the second consecutive month. III The labour market 18 Both of the ONS measures of employment had increased according to the latest data.  LFS employment had increased by 80,000 (0.3%) in the three months to October compared with the previous three months, while the Workforce jobs measure had bounced back in Q3, rising by 97,000 (0.4%) after a fall in Q2.   The two measures were consistent in showing employment growth of around 1% over the past year.  And, as over the previous year, the rise in Workforce jobs in Q3 was accounted for by a strong  rise in employees, partly offset by a fall in the number of  self-employed.  By industry, the recent rise in employee jobs had  been in the services and construction sectors, partly offset by falls in manufacturing and in the other sectors.  Within services, industries which had experienced strong employment growth  over the past year included distribution, hotels and restaurants; finance;  and transport and communications.  Within manufacturing, more than half the net loss in jobs over the past year had been in textiles, although recent falls in employment had been more evenly spread. 19 Revisions to the Workforce jobs data in the latest release had increased the level of employee jobs by around 430,000 in September 1997, and had increased the rate of employment growth during 1997.  These changes, along with GDP revisions, had reduced productivity growth since 1997.  Productivity had grown by 1.6% over the year to 1998 Q3. 20 Turning to other measures of employment demand, LFS total hours worked had increased by 0.3% in August-October, although there had been no change in average hours per worker.  The CIPS employment surveys had reported sharp falls in employment in both construction and manufacturing in December.  Service sector employment had edged down for the first time since the survey began in 1996.  The Manpower survey of employment intentions had shown a sharp deterioration looking ahead to 1999 Q1.  The net balance was at its lowest for 5 years, though after seasonal adjustment by Bank staff it remained around its historical average since 1981. 21 Notifications of new vacancies had fallen by 13,000 in November, although they remained high.  The stock of unfilled vacancies had increased by 4,000 to a new record.  But press advertising had shown a slightly weaker picture, with National Press Recruitment Advertising index beginning to turn down, according to the Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services survey.  And reports from the Bank’s regional Agents suggested that there had been a downturn in local press advertising in recent months. 22 Both LFS unemployment and claimant unemployment had started to rise according to the latest data.  LFS unemployment increased by 16,000, though the rate remained unchanged at 6.2%. Within that rise, the number unemployed for less than one year had risen by 38,000, partly offset by a 21,000 fall in the long-term unemployed.  Claimant unemployment had risen by 6,000 in November, and unlike October’s data, there were no special factors to explain the rise.  The rises in claimant unemployment had mainly been in the regions with higher unemployment rates.  Inflows into the claimant count had increased by 9,000 in November, although they remained low by historical standards. 23 The rise in both LFS employment and unemployment was reconciled by a fall in inactivity.  This fall was concentrated entirely among those not wanting a job, suggesting a slight increase in labour market attachment. 24 There were no new ONS earnings data, the Average Earnings Index having been suspended in November.  The Reward index suggested that earnings growth had slowed a little in November to 4.9%. 25 Turning to settlements, the Bank’s measure of the  twelve-month employment weighted mean wage settlement had remained at 3.7% for the seventh successive month in November. But most settlements were concentrated between January and April, so the twelve-month measure tended to be relatively stable during other periods.  Private and public sector settlements were unchanged at 4.0% and 3.3% respectively.  The three-month employment-weighted mean settlement increased from 3.7% to 3.9%, while the median was unchanged at 4.0%.  Using a matched sample (ie only including firms where data were available for both years) suggested that settlements had been higher in the five months to November 1998 than in the previous year.  74% of employees covered by the Bank’s database (and 55% of firms) awarded higher settlements in 1998 than in 1997.  On a sectoral basis, 77% of service sector employees had received higher settlements in 1998, compared with just 43% in the production sector. 26 In the absence of average earnings data, the ONS had used other sources of data to estimate the growth in wages and salaries for the National Accounts.  The ONS suggested that wages and  Monetary Policy Committee 79 salaries per head had increased by 4.4% in Q3, and growth in Q2 was revised down from 5.6% to 5.1%.  Despite this, unit wage  cost growth was revised up in the year to 1998 Q1 because of changes to the productivity data.  The ONS estimated that unit wage costs had risen by 3.5% in the year to Q2 and by 2.8% in the year to Q3. 27 Real consumption wages had grown by 1% in the year to Q3 because the taxes and prices index (TPI) had risen by over 3%. Real product wages, on the other hand, had grown more strongly, by 3.4%.  Real product wages are deflated by the GDP deflator (at basic prices), which had grown less strongly than the TPI, explaining the large difference. IV Agents’ national summary 28 The Bank’s regional Agents reported on their assessment of the economy drawn from their discussions with contacts over the past month.  The slowdown in activity had become more widespread.  The fall in manufacturing output and orders had persisted;  domestic demand in particular had weakened and import competition had strengthened.  But the decline in export demand had begun to ease somewhat.  Service sector growth had continued to slow, with a significant fall in demand from manufacturers. Consumer demand had weakened:  inward tourism demand in 1999 was expected to be below that of 1998.  However, telecoms and IT firms had reported strong growth and warehouse activity reflected the high stock levels.  Manufacturers had reported high levels of unwanted stocks of finished goods and some had extended their Christmas stoppages to help unwind that position.  The growth in the official retail sales data in November contrasted with reports from Agents’ retailing contacts, which suggested that there had been sluggish sales growth, more in line with the CBI Distributive Trades survey.  Sales growth in the first half of December had also been weak but there had been a noticeable pick-up in the week before Christmas.  Price discounting in December had been greater than in 1997. 29 Upward pressure on wages had continued to ease.  Even sectors of previously intense pressure (such as IT) had reported some easing.  An increasing emphasis on job security had lowered wage expectations.  The Working Time Directive would increase firms’ costs not only through increased paid holiday provision and lost shift flexibility, but also via increased administration and monitoring.  A number of contacts had sought opt-out agreements with their staff.  Employment growth had continued, albeit more slowly, in the service sector, which contrasted with the decline in the November CIPS survey.  Nonetheless, overall unemployment was expected to rise in 1999 as service sector growth would no longer balance job losses in manufacturing. V International environment 30 Evidence from the United States had remained mixed.  GDP growth in Q3 had been revised down slightly, to +0.9%, reflecting weaker net exports.  Industrial production had continued to weaken, growing by 1.5% in the year to November.  Consumer confidence had remained strong in November, but optimism about future employment and incomes had fallen.  Non-farm payrolls had also continued to grow strongly in November, but this was due to seasonal effects, and the annual growth rate had been slowing since August.  Nominal retail sales had grown by 0.6% in November, but real personal consumption had remained unchanged.  M2 increased 8.8% in the year to November. 31 There were few signs that activity had bottomed-out in Japan.  The December Tankan survey had been weak:  the balance for large manufacturers had been recorded at -56 and was now back to February 1994’s low point.  The balance of firms with above-desired levels of employees continued to increase.  The average propensity to consume had fallen in November, and retail sales had fallen 1.5% on a year earlier (the seventh consecutive month of annual decline).  The Tankan survey showed that corporate financial conditions had continued to deteriorate and that banks remained unwilling to lend (confirmed by official data which showed that bank lending had fallen 4.0% on a year earlier in November, although this may have been overstated as a result of debt write-offs).  There was little evidence of fiscal policy supporting public construction orders—these had fallen 14.7% on a year earlier. 32 The quarterly growth rate of the EU5 (France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain) had remained broadly unchanged in Q3.  Private consumption had held up in Germany, France and Italy.  While net trade had contributed positively to GDP growth, largely reflecting weaker import growth, this had been offset by weaker stockbuilding.  In Q4, industrial confidence had continued to weaken, the annual rate of industrial production growth had continued to slow, and euro area capacity utilisation had fallen  for the first time since 1997 Q1.  Against this, consumer  confidence had continued to strengthen in November.  Inflation had remained weak (0.9% on the harmonised measure), and growth of the ECB’s new euro area M3 measure had been close to the reference rate. 33 December Consensus Economics forecasts for 1999, were stronger for the United States, unchanged for Japan, and had been revised down for Germany, France and Italy. 34 Between October and December, the IMF had revised down its 1999 GDP forecasts, most significantly for Japan.  World trade forecasts had also been revised down slightly. VI Prices 35 The Bank’s index of commodity prices excluding oil had risen by 0.8% in November, the biggest monthly rise since June 1997.  The annual rate of inflation had risen to -6.7% in November from -9.2%.  But the suggestion that non-oil commodity price deflation had started to abate had not been supported by the most recent three-month-on-three-month data:  at -3.2% the rate of deflation had been the strongest since January.  And commodity prices including oil continued to fall, by 1.1% in November according to the Bank’s index. 36 Oil prices had stabilised in December following the sharp fall during November.  Despite a brief increase at the beginning of the air strikes against Iraq, the one-month future price of Brent crude oil had risen to $10.53 by the end of December from $10.46 at the beginning.  The effect on the UK real economy of low oil prices was likely to be small relative to the mid 1980s as oil’s share of output, profits and net exports had declined significantly.  And the effect on retail prices inflation had continued to be more than offset by taxes and excise duties.  The rate of fuel price inflation in the United Kingdom had been the highest of any EU country in October. 37 Producer prices had fallen again in November:  input prices had fallen by 0.6%, as in October, and output prices (excluding excise duties) had fallen by 0.1%.  The CIPS and CBI surveys had suggested further falls in December.   38 Other measures of inflation had remained almost unchanged since the December MPC meeting.  Annual retail sales deflator inflation had remained at 0.9% in November.  The GDP at market prices deflator had increased by 1.8% in the year to the third quarter. 39 RPIX inflation had remained equal to the target for the fourth consecutive month in November;  RPIY inflation had remained at 1.8%.  RPI inflation had fallen by 0.1 percentage points since October, to 3.0%.  Goods price inflation had remained much lower than that in services:  RPIY goods inflation had remained just below zero in November.  Inflation Report:  February 1999 80 VII Information from financial markets Foreign exchange 40 Since the previous MPC meeting, the dollar had weakened by about 4.4% against the yen.  The dollar had remained fairly constant against the Deutsche Mark, with a temporary weakness within the month around the time of developments in the Clinton impeachment case.  Contrary to market expectations sterling had initially moved higher against both the dollar and the Deutsche Mark before falling back in the last few days.  Since 29 December the sterling ERI had fallen by around 2%, returning it to the levels prevailing at the previous MPC meeting. 41 The transition to the euro had been smooth.  In its first 24 hours of trading, the euro had appreciated against most other currencies, including sterling. Government bond and money markets 42 Since the previous MPC meeting, the short-term interest rates implied by short sterling futures contracts had fallen further, and indicated that the current interest rate cycle was expected to bottom out in June 2000.  New economic data had had little impact on expectations.  The implied two-week repo rate two weeks forward was 14 basis points below the prevailing two-week repo rate.  This was consistent with anecdotes suggesting that the market believed there was an evens chance of a 25 basis point cut in rates this month. 43 Euro-area rates had fallen, while United States rates had mainly risen.  United Kingdom rates were close to short dollar rates from December 2000 onwards. 44 There had been a large rise in Japanese bond yields of around 80 basis points over the month.  Market commentators had suggested that this was associated with an announcement that government trust funds would not buy a material amount of bonds in the current year, when bond issuance is set to rise. 45 United Kingdom yields at medium maturities were around  45 basis points below those in the United States, and some 60 basis points above those in Germany and France.  In forward rate terms, this meant that United Kingdom yields beyond 5 years were now below German levels. 46 The United Kingdom had experienced a decline in  index-linked government bond yields that had not been shared with other countries.  This was sufficient to explain the fall in nominal yields, especially at the long end, but was not itself easily explained. Equity and corporate debt markets 47 Most equity markets had risen since the last MPC.  The US market was 7% above the July pre-crisis peak.  The Japanese market had fallen a further 10%.  The rise in the UK market had been broadly based, possibly reflecting lower real interest rates. 48 Analysts’ forecasts of the growth in earnings per share for FT-SE 100 companies for the current financial year had continued to be revised downwards, and the median forecast had become negative.  The path of revisions seen during 1998 was much sharper than since 1992. 49 The number of profit warnings was running at a higher level than last year.  Fewer companies were citing the level of sterling as a cause of the lower profits, but more were citing weak domestic demand. 50 The level of equity market uncertainty, as measured by implied volatility, was slightly down since the previous MPC meeting, but was still higher than before the recent turbulence.   51 There had been little movement in credit spreads in the United Kingdom or the United States.  The yield spread of an index of UK bank bonds over high-rated corporates had remained at a high level, possibly reflecting greater uncertainty over the outlook for banks since the Russian crisis.  Monetary Policy Committee 81 The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee today voted to reduce the Bank’s repo rate by 0.5% to 5.5%. Taking account, in particular, of the prospects for international activity and prices, domestic costs and consumer demand, the Committee’s latest inflation projections implied that a further reduction in interest rates was necessary to keep inflation on a path consistent with the target of 21/2%.  The latest projections and analysis will appear in the Inflation Report to be published on Wednesday 10 February. The minutes of the meeting will be published at 9.30 am on Wednesday 17 February. Text of Bank of England press notice of 5 February 1999 Bank of England reduces interest rates by 0.5% to 5.5%  Text of Bank of England press notice of 7 January 1999 Bank of England reduces interest rates by 0.25% to 6% The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee today voted to reduce the Bank’s repo rate by 0.25% to 6.0%. Since the Committee’s December meeting, domestic data and survey evidence have, on balance, shown a continuing slowdown in the UK economy.  The labour market remains tight but it seems to have reached a turning point.  Evidence from wage settlements and the Bank’s regional Agents suggest an easing of upward pressures on growth in pay.  The risks from the international environment remain clearly on the downside.  In these circumstances the Committee judged that a further reduction in interest rates of 0.25% to 6.0% was appropriate in order to maintain a path for inflation consistent with the target. The minutes of the meeting will be published at 9.30 am on Wednesday 20 January.  Glossary and other information Glossary of selected data AEI: Average Earnings Index.

1999-05-12,"Inflation Report May 1999 The Inflation Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff  under the guidance of the members of the Monetary  Policy Committee.  It serves two purposes.  First,  its preparation provides a comprehensive and  forward-looking framework for discussion among MPC  members as an aid to our decision making.  Second, its  publication allows us to share our thinking and explain  the reasons for our decisions to those whom they affect. Although not every member will agree with every  assumption on which our projections are based, the fan  charts represent the MPC’s best collective judgment  about the most likely path for inflation and output, and the  uncertainties surrounding those central projections. This Report has been prepared and published by the  Bank of England in accordance with section 18 of the  Bank of England Act 1998. The Monetary Policy Committee: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Alan Budd Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers The Overview of this Inflation Report is available on the Bank’s web site:   www.bankofengland.co.uk/infrep.htm.

Printed by Park Communications Ltd © Bank of England 1999 ISBN 1 85730 117 X ISSN 1353–6737  i Overview Prospects for the world economy, which deteriorated sharply in the second half of last year, have improved in recent months.  But the immediate outlook is for modest growth of world output and trade.  The expected slowdown in UK growth has occurred.  Forward-looking survey measures, some of which had fallen precipitously, have now recovered to levels consistent with a pick-up in growth.  Inflation on the RPIX measure has remained close to 2.5%, and future inflation expectations appear reasonably well anchored to the inflation target.  Sterling has risen strongly, in particular relative to the euro, over the past three months. In the world economy, the remarkable growth of domestic demand and output in the United States has continued, without evident inflationary pressure.  In the euro area, growth and business confidence have weakened further, though the ECB’s sharp interest rate reduction in April should help to support activity.  It is unclear when Japan will emerge from protracted recession.  Spreads on emerging market debt have moderated, there are signs of renewed growth in some countries affected by the Asian crisis, and Brazil has made progress towards stability.  Trade imbalances among the major industrialised countries have widened. In the United Kingdom, aggregate output growth slowed slightly earlier than believed at the time of the February Inflation Report.  Growth in the third and fourth quarters of 1998 was revised down to 0.3% and 0.1% respectively, and the preliminary estimate of growth in the first quarter of this year was 0.1%.  Service sector growth stands in contrast to declining manufacturing production.  Forward-looking business survey indicators have risen uniformly in recent months, and there are some signs—for example in the housing market—of restored consumer confidence.   Output continued to rise because domestic demand growth offset the weakening external position.  The trade  ii Inflation Report:  May 1999 balance made a negative contribution to growth for the third successive year, equivalent to 1.8 percentage points of GDP in 1998.  Consumption growth picked up in the fourth quarter of last year, and investment demand has been stronger than expected.  The extent of any inventory overhang seems to have been reduced.  The March Budget left public expenditure plans and the overall stance of fiscal policy broadly unchanged. In line with the slowdown in GDP growth, broad money growth continued to moderate in the first quarter, largely reflecting reduced money holdings by the non-bank financial sector.  Personal sector borrowing has shown signs of more rapid growth, however.  Consistent with other evidence of renewed strength in the housing market, there have recently been marked increases in secured lending and loan approvals.   The labour market remains tight on most measures, but is not currently tightening further.  Unemployment has increased slightly over the past three months, but remains close to its lowest level for twenty years. Aggregate employment has continued to grow quite robustly despite slower output growth, so measured productivity growth has fallen.  Service sector employment has risen;  that in manufacturing has fallen. Total hours worked have been broadly flat, so hours worked per head have fallen, reflecting less overtime and a growing proportion of part-time workers in the labour force.  Vacancies remain high relative to unemployment. However, skill shortages appear to have eased, and survey data suggest that firms’ employment intentions are significantly weaker than a year ago.  Publication of the official Average Earnings Index was resumed in March.  According to the new headline measure, nominal earnings growth reached a peak of 5.7% in the second quarter of 1998—higher than previously thought—before easing to about 4.5% at the turn of the year.  Evidence on private sector wage settlements also points to lower inflationary pressure in the labour market.  At the same time, the substantial reduction that has occurred in inflation expectations means that real earnings growth has fallen by less than nominal earnings growth, and, on some measures, may have risen.   Most measures of expected inflation are now consistent with the 21/2% inflation target. The implications for prospective inflation of reduced pay pressure and stronger sterling were the main factors that  iii Overview led the Monetary Policy Committee to reduce interest rates by a further 0.25% to 5.25% in April.   The MPC’s current projection for the growth rate of GDP—based on the assumption that the Bank’s repo rate remains constant at 5.25%—is shown in Chart 1.  The central projection is for the four-quarter rate of GDP growth to rise later this year from its current level of between 1/2% and 1% to around trend by the middle of next year.  The profile is similar to the February projection, but the pick-up in growth in the central projection begins slightly sooner, domestic demand growth is stronger, and net trade is weaker.  The probability of a decline in output is judged to have fallen.   The corresponding projection for RPIX inflation is shown in Chart 2.  The most likely path is for inflation to fall slightly below target over the next year or so, before rising to around 2.5% at the two-year forecast horizon. The projected decline in inflation in the near term is largely the result of lower nominal earnings growth and a higher starting-point for sterling than previously assumed.  Inflation rises towards the forecast horizon as demand growth strengthens and as the restraining influence on prices of the strong exchange rate wears off.  Indeed, the projection assumes that sterling declines from its present high level, at least in line with interest rate differentials. The uncertainties surrounding the projection for GDP growth are broadly balanced.  The possibility of a fall in equity wealth is a downside risk for consumption. Upside risks to activity arise from the possibilities that sterling will be weaker, and that stockbuilding will be less negative, than in the central projection.  Assuming that the exchange rate is likely to decline by more than implied by interest rate differentials, the balance of risks to inflation is upwards.  However, some Committee members see greater downside risks to inflation from a stronger exchange rate profile, weaker world activity and prices, and greater pressure on margins, than in the central projection. The starting-point for sterling in the projection is 41/2% higher than assumed in the February Report.  The rise in the exchange rate is likely to exacerbate the imbalance between the international and domestic sectors of the economy.  It is also likely to bear down on inflation in the short term.  The projection assumes that sterling will decline from its present high level.

But if sterling does not decline, then, depending on other developments in the economy, further easing of monetary policy might be needed to prevent undershooting of the inflation target. The economy is now on course for growth with price stability.  But exchange rate movements and other events affecting inflation are inevitably uncertain.  As those events unfold, the Monetary Policy Committee will continue to set interest rates at whatever level it judges necessary to keep inflation on track to meet the 21/2% target.

Section 2 The international environment Quarterly Bulletin, May 1999, pages 152–60.  3 Money and financial markets 1 Annual growth in broad money continued to slow in the first quarter of 1999, largely reflecting a further decline in the rate of growth of non-bank financial sector holdings.  Year-on-year growth in M4 lending slowed by less, leaving it slightly above the annual rate of growth in broad money.  Growth in lending to individuals secured on dwellings increased in the first quarter of 1999, in line with strengthening activity in the housing market.   Share prices rose internationally, in many cases to record levels.  Following stronger-than-expected global economic data, conventional government bond yields rose in a number of G7 countries, including the United Kingdom.  Sterling appreciated significantly, in particular against the euro.   At its March meeting, the MPC voted to leave interest rates unchanged at 5.5%.  The MPC voted to cut the Bank’s repo rate by 0.25 percentage points to 5.25% on 8 April.  The MPC voted to leave interest rates unchanged at its meeting on 6 May. 1.1 Money and credit  Narrow money The value of notes and coin in circulation increased by 0.7% in April, raising the twelve-month growth rate to 5.8% (see Table 1.A).  Growth in notes and coin has been picking up since September.  That is consistent with a fall in the opportunity cost of holding money as interest rates have been reduced.  Annual growth in nominal retail sales also picked up slightly in 1999 Q1. However, the relationship between narrow money and nominal retail sales growth has not been as strong in this recovery as during the 1980s. Broad money The rate of increase in broad money has continued to moderate.  Annual growth fell by around 4 percentage points between 1997 Q1 and 1999 Q1, to 6.9%. Annualised short-term rates of growth remained below the twelve-month rate, suggesting that the annual rate may slow further.  That would bring it more into line with the rate of broad money growth consistent with the MPC’s central projections for activity and inflation, Table 1.A Growth rates of narrow and broad money(a) Per cent 1 month 3 months (b) 6 months (b) 12 months Notes & coin Jan. 1999 0.5 6.1 6.1 5.4 Feb. 0.5 6.5 6.1 5.4 Mar. 0.5 5.7 5.7 5.6 Apr. 0.7 6.5 6.3 5.8 M4 Dec. 1998 0.7 6.4 7.5 8.2 Jan. 1999 0.1 4.4 5.1 7.6 Feb. 0.5 5.4 6.2 7.2 Mar. 0.4 3.9 5.1 6.9 M4 lending (c) Dec. 1998 0.6 5.4 7.6 7.9 Jan. 1999 0.5 4.9 6.6 7.8 Feb. 0.5 6.5 6.1 7.0 Mar. 0.7 7.1 6.2 7.4 Source:  Bank of England.

The annual rate of increase in bank and building society lending to the rest of the private sector (M4 lending) was 7.2% in the first quarter of 1999, slightly above the growth in M4 deposits (see Chart 1.1). Private non-financial corporations (PNFCs) Net M4 borrowing (borrowing(1) minus deposits) by private non-financial corporations rose significantly between 1997 Q4 and 1998 Q4, as annual deposit growth fell from 6.7% to 4.3%, and growth in borrowing picked up from 3.4% to 6.3%.  By 1998 Q4, the corporate sector financial deficit had reached 3% of GDP—its highest level since 1990.  Net M4 borrowing by the corporate sector fell by £3.3 billion in the first quarter of 1999, reflecting both a drop in borrowing and an increase in deposits.  However, private non-financial corporations can also raise funds through wholesale markets.  Capital market issues rose by £6.1 billion in 1999 Q1, compared with a rise of £2.4 billion in  1998 Q4.  So overall corporate sector borrowing remained strong in the first quarter of 1999. Firms tend to finance temporary imbalances between current income and expenditure mainly through net borrowing from banks and building societies.  There was a rise in the stock to output ratio relative to its long-run trend during the second half of 1998.  Firms may therefore have borrowed more and/or run down their deposits with banks, in order to finance the cost of holding any excess stocks (see Chart 1.2).  The increase in corporate sector borrowing relative to deposits may also have been linked to the strong rise in business investment in the second half of 1998. Household sector Household sector broad money holdings grew by 6.5% in the year to the first quarter of 1999, the same rate of growth as in 1998 Q4.  Lending(1) to households was 7.8% higher in 1999 Q1 than a year earlier, compared with an average rate of growth of 7.2% during 1998.   Bank and building society lending to individuals can be divided into lending secured on dwellings, which accounts for about 85% of the stock, and unsecured lending which accounts for the rest.  Annual growth in net secured lending to individuals picked up from 5.5% in 1998 Q2 to 6.2% in 1999 Q1.

Money and financial markets 5 which includes lending by specialist institutions other than banks and building societies, annual growth in lending secured on dwellings was 6.4% in the first quarter of 1999.  By contrast, growth in unsecured lending which had been rising very rapidly, appears to have stabilised in recent quarters, though it remained well above the growth in secured lending (see Chart 1.3). The rise in secured lending in the first quarter of 1999 was consistent with other indicators of improving demand in the housing market.  In March, the number of loans approved for house purchase rose to 101,000 from 89,000 in February, and the value of loans approved for secured lending rose to £10.2 billion.  The value of loans approved, which includes re-mortgaging agreements, has tended to lead changes in secured lending by 4–6 weeks. That suggests that the growth in secured lending to individuals will remain robust in coming months (see Chart 1.4). Other financial corporations (OFCs) OFCs are non-bank financial intermediaries.  After growing at an average annual rate of more than 22% between 1995 Q1 and 1998 Q3, growth in OFCs’ M4 deposits slowed in 1998 Q4 and fell sharply to 6.6% in the first quarter of 1999.  Annual growth in lending to the non-bank financial sector, which had averaged more than 16% during the same period, also slowed in  1998 Q4, and declined further to 8.4% in 1999 Q1. The increase and subsequent contraction in OFCs’ balance sheets has broadly coincided with changes in net sterling lending by UK banks and building societies to non-UK residents (see Chart 1.5).  The average monthly flow in net sterling lending to non-UK residents was  £1.1 billion between January 1996 and June 1998, compared with £0.2 billion during 1992–95.  It has since fallen back sharply;  overseas residents made a total  net repayment of sterling loans of £7.1 billion in  1999 Q1. It is possible, therefore, that the sterling borrowed by overseas residents was used to carry out transactions with UK financial intermediaries.  However, there is little evidence that the funds were intended for the acquisition of UK companies.  Chart 1.6 shows that  cash-financed mergers and acquisitions activity has been relatively subdued during the past two years. Furthermore, the rise in OFCs’ deposit growth since 1996 was not accounted for by an increase in M4 Chart 1.5 Net overseas borrowing(a) in sterling and  OFCs’ deposits 10 5 0 5 10 15 1991 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 Net sterling borrowing   by non-UK residents OFCs’ deposits  Flows, £ billions + _ Source:  Bank of England.

Inflation Report:  May 1999 6 holdings by insurance companies and pension funds, which hold around 60% of quoted UK equities by value. Instead the rise in deposits reflects increased holdings by the rest of the non-bank financial sector, which includes securities dealers (see Chart 1.7).   Another explanation for the increase in net sterling borrowing by non-UK residents may therefore be an increase in overseas demand for other UK securities. Alternatively, the observed correlation between the increase in OFCs’ deposits and net overseas sterling borrowing may simply reflect a desire by UK banks and building societies to match their assets (in this case, sterling lending overseas) with deposits from the UK wholesale sector. The reasons for the sudden reversal of net overseas borrowing in sterling in the first quarter of 1999 are similarly unclear.  Nonetheless, to the extent that they are linked, further reductions in net overseas borrowing in sterling, and hence in OFCs’ deposit growth, could help to stabilise broad money velocity, which has been falling since 1994.  As Chart 1.8 shows, excluding the M4 deposits held by the UK non-bank financial sector, broad money has been growing in line with nominal GDP during the 1990s.  A more stable, and hence more predictable, trend in M4 velocity would enhance the ability of broad money to act as a reliable indicator of inflationary pressure. Divisia money Another way of trying to gauge the extent to which the recent changes in the demand for money represent shifts in agents’ current or future demand for goods and services is to compare the growth of M4 with growth in Divisia money.  The Divisia index is constructed by weighting together the various components of money according to their liquidity, proxied by the inverse of their interest rates relative to a benchmark local authority deposit rate.  More liquid assets carry lower interest rates, and so are more likely to be used for transactions purposes.  Divisia money should therefore be more closely related to nominal spending than other broad measures of money.  Divisia money grew by 7.3% in the year to 1999 Q1, broadly unchanged from 1998 Q4, but slightly faster than the rate of growth in M4 deposits. Chart 1.9 shows the positive correlation between Divisia money and nominal domestic demand over the past  20 years, though the relationship has been somewhat weaker since 1995.

The  short-run impact of changes in monetary policy on aggregate demand and the exchange rate will depend on a number of factors.  These include the extent to which changes in the central bank’s official short-term interest rate were anticipated and the speed with which they are passed on to consumers and firms.(1) Short-term administered rates, such as mortgage and deposit rates, generally respond fully to changes in official interest rates, but there can be significant time-lags (see  Chart 1.10).  The pass-through of the interest rate cut of 8 April has so far been less than complete (see  Table 1.B), in contrast to the other cuts since the beginning of October which were passed through relatively quickly.  Risk-neutral probability distributions of expected  three-month market rates derived from options prices on 5 May are shown in Chart 1.11.  Uncertainty about the likely path of interest rates over the next year, as measured by the width of the blue fan, has narrowed a little on the downside since the February Report.  Market expectations for the most likely outcome shown by the darkest blue band were, on balance, for rates to remain close to their current level, though there were some expectations of a rise in 2000.   The European Central Bank cut its refinancing rate by 0.5 percentage points to 2.5% on 8 April.  The market expects short-term rates in the euro area to remain close to their current level over the next year.  The Bank of Japan cut its official target rate, the overnight call rate, by 0.1 percentage points to 0.15% on 12 February, and by a further 0.12 percentage points to 0.03% on  4 March.  The US Federal Reserve has not changed rates since November.   Long-term interest rates Nominal yields on UK government bonds at all maturities have fallen substantially since 1996, but have risen since the February Report.  The nominal yield on ten-year gilts rose by 0.4 percentage points to 4.8% between 10 February and 5 May, largely driven by higher interest rate expectations at the shorter end of the (1) For a discussion of how official interest rate decisions affect economic activity and inflation, see ‘The transmission mechanism of monetary policy’ in the May 1999 Quarterly Bulletin, pages 161–70.

The chart depicts the probability distribution for short-term interest rates and is rather like a contour map. So at any given point, the depth of shading represents the height of the probability density function implied by the markets over a range of outcomes for short-term interest rates.  The markets judge that there is a 10% chance of interest rates being within the darkest, central band at any date.  Each successive pair of bands covers a further 20% of the probability distribution until 90% of the distribution is covered.  The bands widen as the time horizon is extended, indicating  increased uncertainty about interest rate outcomes.  Inflation Report:  May 1999 8 curve (see Chart 1.12).  The nominal yield on ten-year US and euro-area government bonds also rose over the same period, by around 0.5 percentage points, though this reflected higher short and medium-term interest rate expectations. Changes in nominal interest rate expectations reflect revisions to expectations about inflation, real interest rates and/or risk premia.  The recent increases in nominal bond yields appear to have been driven by higher inflation expectations.  In addition, the forward real rate of interest in France also fell (see Charts 1.13 and 1.14). Despite the recent rise in UK long-term real yields, they remain close to their lowest levels since index-linked government bonds were first introduced in 1981;  and well below those in other countries (see Chart 1.14).  A number of UK-specific institutional factors could account for part of this difference.  For example, the minimum funding requirement (MFR) for pension funds has led to strong institutional demand for bonds, particularly long-maturity and index-linked bonds.  In addition, there has been substantial demand from insurance companies for bonds, perhaps to hold as a hedge against liabilities arising from guarantees of minimum returns on annuities sold when yields were higher than they are at present.  These factors have led to a strong demand for sterling bonds, which has put upward pressure on the price of both conventional and index-linked UK government securities.   To the extent that yields on UK index-linked bonds have been depressed by these factors, measures of implied inflation expectations derived from the index-linked market will be exaggerated.  The implied rate of inflation in five years’ time derived from the bond market has risen by 0.4 percentage points since the February Report to 2.6%.  That is a larger rise than is implied by measures derived from other sources.  For example, inflation expectations over the same period derived from the Consensus Economics survey stood at 2.5% in April, 0.1–0.2 percentage points higher than in October.  And shorter-term inflation expectations derived from a variety of UK surveys fell further in  1999 Q2 (see Section 3). Equity prices Since the publication of the February Report, share prices have risen sharply in most developed economies, to record levels in some cases, including in the United Kingdom.

Money and financial markets 9 medium-sized UK companies have risen particularly strongly since February (see Chart 1.15).  Previous  work at the Bank suggests that domestic economic prospects are more likely to influence changes in  share prices of these companies than of larger companies, which tend to be more internationally orientated.   Equity prices are positively related to expectations  about future profits, but are negatively related to risk. Uncertainty about the future level of UK share prices,  as measured by options prices on the FT-SE 100, has fallen steadily since the beginning of 1999, more so than a similar measure for the United States.  The latest  Merrill Lynch survey of UK fund managers showed a positive balance of 33% who thought that the prospects for UK corporate profits were favourable—compared with a negative balance of 44% in February.  These factors are consistent with the strong pick-up in expectations for UK earnings per share growth since  the beginning of 1999, for both this year and next, as reported in the Merrill Lynch survey (see Chart 1.16). The MPC assumes that there is a greater risk of a fall in UK equity prices than of a further rise, relative to the central-case assumption of growth in line with nominal demand. Property prices Growth in the capital value of commercial property has been declining since the beginning of 1998.  And there was a slight decline in the annual rate of growth in the rental value of commercial property.  Inflation  indicators in the housing market were more mixed. Despite a strong rise in March, on both the Halifax and the Nationwide measures annual house price inflation remained weaker in the first few months of 1999 than  in 1998.  Annual house price inflation in London and  the South East, which has in the past led national house price inflation, weakened by less in the year to 1999 Q1. And the March Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) survey showed a net positive balance of 76% of estate agents reporting an increase in house prices in London, considerably higher than elsewhere.  The RICS survey also reported a fall to historical lows in the number of properties on estate agents’ books, which may constrain activity in the short run.  However, as noted above, loan approvals nationally for house purchases rose strongly in 1999 Q1, indicating continued strength in demand.

Inflation Report:  May 1999 10 Exchange rates The sterling effective exchange rate index (ERI) averaged 104.0 in the 15 working days up to and including 5 May (see Chart 1.17).  This is the  starting-point for the current projection and is around 41/2% higher than the path assumed at the time of the previous Report.  The level of the ERI is 23% higher than it was in August 1996, largely reflecting an increase of 29% in the value of sterling against euro-area currencies.  Sterling has risen by around 5% against the US dollar.  Since 1990, however, the appreciation of the broader measure of the ERI, which includes a number of emerging market currencies, has been greater than that of the narrower measure. Previous Reports have discussed a number of possible explanations for the rise in the sterling exchange rate since August 1996.  Around a half of the rise in the sterling ERI since February is consistent with the movements in the differential between expected UK interest rates and those overseas (see Chart 1.18).  But estimates of monetary news based on relative yield curves can explain little of the overall increase in the ERI since August 1996. There is considerable ambiguity about the link between the exchange rate and observable capital flows.  But the record surplus on investment income, which contributed to UK current account surpluses in 1997 and 1998, may explain part of the strength of sterling.  A permanent improvement in the UK investment income surplus would imply that UK residents would be able to finance a larger trade deficit than previously, without putting downward pressure on the exchange rate, making sterling assets relatively more attractive to hold.   International competitiveness depends on the level of the real exchange rate.  By combining forecasts of the expected nominal exchange rate and inflation expectations from the Consensus Economics survey, it is possible to arrive at an estimate of the expected value of the real ERI.  Chart 1.19 shows how successive expectations of a depreciation of the real exchange rate lessened over time. Chart 1.20 shows the path for the sterling ERI implied by market nominal interest rate differentials.  This method is based on the assumption that, other things being equal, currencies should adjust to equalise the rate of return on assets across countries.  So if UK forward rates are above those overseas, sterling is expected to Chart 1.17 Sterling effective exchange rates(a) 80 90 100 110 120 130 1990 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 Broad ERI ERI 1990 = 100 Chart 1.18 The exchange rate and monetary news 1 0 1 2 3 4 10 Feb. 24 Feb. 10 Mar. 24 Mar. 7 Apr. 21 Apr. 5 May Cumulative change  in ERI (per cent) (a)  Band of estimated monetary news  (percentage points) (b)  5 + – 1999 Source:  Bank of England.

(a) The ERI is a trade-weighted index of 20 countries’ exchange rates against  sterling.  The broad ERI is constructed using 49 countries’ exchange rates.  Money and financial markets 11 depreciate.  It shows that the markets expect the recent appreciation of sterling to unwind. In constructing its forecast, the MPC makes assumptions about the future path for sterling, conditional on unchanged UK interest rates.  In judging the most likely path for sterling, the MPC takes into account both interest rate differentials and risk factors.  In the central projection (the modal or most likely case), the sterling ERI is expected to depreciate by more than 4% to 99.6 by 2001 Q1.  On average, sterling is expected to decline more steeply than in the central projection.  Outside forecasts reported by Consensus Economics imply that the exchange rate is expected to decline more rapidly than in the central projection, reaching 96.7 after two years.  But some Committee members consider that the balance of risks around the central projection for the exchange rate is on the upside. 1.3 Summary UK broad money growth has continued to ease, but M4 lending growth has declined less, reflecting a rise in secured lending to individuals.  The past three years have been characterised by a significant build-up and subsequent contraction in UK financial intermediaries’ balance sheets, which may have been linked to the behaviour of net sterling borrowing by overseas residents.  There is some evidence of an increase in  long-term global inflation expectations, but in the United Kingdom comparisons between conventional and  index-linked yields may be distorted by institutional factors.  Share prices have risen strongly, possibly reflecting a better-than-expected outlook for domestic and global growth.  Sterling has appreciated significantly since the February Report, particularly against the euro.

Chart 2.2 Trade balances The quarterly growth rate of GDP remained weak in 1999 Q1 and the level of output in previous quarters has been revised down since the February Report.  However, survey measures of consumer and business confidence in the United Kingdom have rebounded and global economic prospects have improved slightly.  In 1998 Q4, exports fell and imports rose, causing the goods and services trade deficit to widen further.  This largely offset the impact on GDP of stronger consumption and investment growth. 2.1 Net trade(1) Net trade made a sizable negative contribution to output growth in 1998, the third consecutive year in which the increase in domestic demand has exceeded that of GDP. Chart 2.1 shows that movements in the trade position are strongly influenced by demand differences between the United Kingdom and its main trade partners.  This effect was small in 1998, however, as UK domestic demand growth was broadly the same as the (weighted) increase in demand in these countries.  Consequently, most of  last year’s rise in the trade deficit reflected other considerations, notably the sharp contraction in demand from the emerging market economies of Asia and the  oil-exporting countries (which, together, account for only around 15% of UK exports), and the continuing effects of sterling’s appreciation. In 1998 Q4, the deficit on the United Kingdom’s trade in goods and services reached 3.8% of GDP, its highest level in almost a decade.  Export volumes of goods and services fell by 1.6%, reducing them to broadly the same level as a year earlier, while import volumes of goods and services increased by 1.3%, leaving them 6.2% higher than a year earlier.  But despite these developments, the current account remained in surplus (see Chart 2.2), owing to terms of trade price effects and exceptionally low outflows of investment income—a number of foreign enterprises operating in the United Kingdom (primarily oil companies, banks, and securities dealers) made significant losses in the second half of 1998.

Chart 2.4 Consensus forecasts for 1999 GDP growth Source:  Consensus Economics. The weakness of exports in Q4 mainly reflected lower sales of goods to Europe and North America (see  Table 2.A).  Given that US demand has remained strong, the fall in sales to North America in Q4 was probably erratic;  export volumes to this market recovered in Q1. In contrast, exports to the European Union continued to decline in January and February, reflecting the effects of sterling’s appreciation against the euro-area currencies and weakening demand.  Among the developing countries, there is increasing evidence that Asian demand conditions have begun to stabilise.  As a result, the sharp decline in UK exports to this region has moderated since 1998 Q4 (see Chart 2.3).  However, the recent increase in the price of oil has yet to feed through to stronger UK sales to the oil-exporting countries. Looking ahead, the prospects for external demand seem a little brighter than the assessment made at the time of the February Report.  In its April forecast, the IMF raised its projection for this year’s world GDP growth by 0.1 percentage point, to 2.3%.  This largely reflected a reassessment of prospects for the industrial countries, with expected growth in North America revised upwards significantly and prospective growth in Japan and the euro area revised downwards.  Recent changes to private sector forecasts have generally followed these IMF revisions (see Chart 2.4).  Overall, the IMF now expects the GDP of advanced economies as a whole to increase by 2.0% in 1999 (0.4 percentage points higher than its December forecast). Large demand changes in the emerging market economies can also have a significant impact on the  UK trade balance, as the Asian crisis demonstrated. Following the collapse of Brazil’s exchange rate regime in January, private sector forecasts of Latin American growth in 1999 have been marked down by around  2 percentage points.  The direct impact on the United Kingdom of lower growth in Latin America is likely to be small, however, since this region accounts for only about 21/2% of UK exports and less than 5% of total world trade.  Contagion effects to other emerging market economies have generally been limited and growth projections for some of the Asia Pacific countries have now started to be revised up slightly. Taking all these developments together, the prospects for UK trade-weighted world import growth have improved modestly, relative to the assessment made at the time of the February Inflation Report.  The MPC has consequently revised up its central expectation for UK export market growth in 2000 to 5%–6%, and left the Table 2.A UK goods export growth  Per cent  Region Share of total Average quarterly changes in export  UK goods  volumes (a) exports in 1997 1998 1999 Q1–Q3 Q4 Q1 European Union 55.8 1.4 -1.2 n.a.

(a) Goods import volumes by the United Kingdom’s trade partners,  calculated using UK trade weights. projection for this year unchanged at around 4%–5%. The MPC’s central projection is for demand growth in the major six overseas economies to exceed UK domestic demand growth slightly this year.   Competitiveness effects have also contributed to the rising trade deficit.  In particular, the real appreciation of sterling over the past three years (see Chart 2.5) has boosted imports and constrained exports.  In addition, trade diversion arising from the depressed demand conditions in Japan and the rest of Asia may have increased the degree of global competition facing British firms. Evidence of these competitiveness effects can be seen in both the United Kingdom’s export and import performance.  On the export side, firms located in the United Kingdom have accounted for a declining share of both EU and non-EU markets over the past two years (see Chart 2.6), as UK exports have failed to keep pace with the (weighted) import growth of the United Kingdom’s trade partners (see Chart 2.7).  This loss of trade share has been particularly striking in EU markets; prior to 1996, the United Kingdom had been increasing its trade share in these markets.  And, on the import side, import penetration now appears to have been greater than previously thought;  data revisions since the February Report have increased the share of imports in domestic demand in 1998. Overall, relative demand conditions are likely to be broadly neutral for the trade deficit this year.  Hence  the dominant influence on the trade balance in 1999 is likely to be the strength of sterling and non-price competitiveness effects.  The MPC’s central projection is for net trade to make another negative contribution to GDP growth in 1999 and for this effect to be more negative than was assumed at the time of the February Report.   2.2 Domestic demand Domestic demand increased by 1.0% in 1998 Q4, up from 0.5% in both Q2 and Q3.  This increase reflected stronger growth in consumption and investment, as well as a rise in the contribution to growth from the change in inventories (see Table 2.B).  Despite this faster quarterly growth, the annual rate of increase continued to slow— in the year to 1998 Q4, domestic demand grew by 2.7%, down from 3.3% in Q2 and Q3.

Although the Q4 outturn was a little stronger than the MPC’s central projection at the time of the February Report, the increase in spending was not evenly based.  In line with the fall in retail sales volumes in Q4, spending on retail goods (which account for about 40% of total consumption) actually declined.  The faster growth of total consumption reflected continued strong spending on most categories of services, combined with a rebound in expenditure on vehicles and energy products. Evidence from retail sales and consumer confidence surveys suggests that household consumption may have grown at a similar rate in 1999 Q1.  Following the decline in Q4, the volume of retail sales increased by 1.1% in the first quarter.  Recent CBI Distributive Trades surveys have confirmed this picture of stronger retail spending and have indicated an expectation among retailers that this sales growth would be maintained in Q2.  Similarly, survey measures of consumer confidence have improved considerably since their low points in October (see Chart 2.9).  Consumer fears about higher unemployment have also partly receded and housing market activity, another indicator of consumer sentiment, has picked up since the end of last year. The previous Inflation Report, and minutes of recent MPC meetings, have noted that the slowdown in consumption growth during 1998 was sharper than the MPC had expected, and have discussed a number of possible reasons for this.  One of these was that past fiscal tightening may have been greater than previously thought.  Unfortunately, this has been difficult to assess, since a number of changes came into effect at around the same time.  These included the July 1997 Budget measures, a new system of self-assessment for income tax, and an extension to the returns deadline.  Since the third of these elements significantly altered the pattern of tax payments between 1997 Q4 and 1998 Q1 (see  Chart 2.10), the full impact of the changes will not be known until the new seasonal pattern of receipts can be determined.  On the basis of the available data, the effective tax rate on households’ income is estimated to have increased by between 1/2 and 1 percentage point in 1998, equivalent to 0.4%–0.7% of GDP.  Higher taxes are therefore likely to explain some of the slowdown in the growth rate of consumption last year.  The actual size of this effect will have been determined by whether households viewed the tax changes as temporary or 1990 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 Percentage changes Quarter on previous quarter Year on previous year + _ Average annual growth rate (1955–98) Chart 2.8 Household consumption growth Table 2.B Quarterly growth rate of GDP(a) Percentage change  1998 Q2 Q3 Q4 Consumption: Households 0.5 0.1 0.6 Non profit making institutions  serving households 0.4 0.2 0.2 Government 0.4 0.6 0.3 Investment  -0.7 2.6 2.9 Final domestic demand 0.2 0.6 0.9 Change in inventories (b)(c) -0.1 -0.1 0.0 Domestic demand 0.5 0.5 1.0 Net trade (b) -0.3 -0.3 -0.9 GDP at market prices 0.3 0.3 0.1 (a) At constant 1995 market prices.

Non seasonally adjusted data. Chart 2.11 Real household pre-tax income growth permanent, and by the extent to which the introduction of the new system of self-assessment encouraged an increase in tax compliance. Looking ahead, the measures introduced in the March 1999 Budget are expected by HM Treasury to leave the effective tax rate on household incomes broadly unchanged over the next three years.  Overall, therefore, the factors which may have caused consumption growth to slow by more than the MPC had expected in 1998— higher taxes, lower consumer confidence, and the unwinding of the windfall payout effects arising from the building society demutualisations—seem likely to have less of a restraining influence in 1999.  This suggests that the growth rate of consumption will become more closely aligned with its fundamental determinants (labour income and total net wealth) this year. As can be seen from Chart 2.11, the growth rate of real pre-tax primary incomes (wages and salaries plus net property income) slowed in 1998.  This was largely because of higher net interest payments by the household sector and weaker growth in equity dividends; the growth rate of real wages and salaries remained reasonably robust.  This slowdown in the growth rate of primary incomes is unlikely to continue in 1999. Households’ net interest payments are likely to fall in 1999, as the rise in official interest rates over the  14 months to June 1998 has now been more than completely reversed.  This fall in official interest rates tends to feed through to lower loan rates for households with a lag, partly because of the impact of fixed-rate loans (see Section 1).  In addition, surveys by the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) have found a recovery in firms’ profit expectations in recent months, suggesting that the growth rate of dividend payments is unlikely to weaken much further in 1999. Household spending will also be affected by wage and salary developments and wealth considerations.  The MPC’s central expectation is that this year’s growth rate of real earnings may be slightly stronger than in 1998 (see Section 6).  Furthermore, there are likely to be positive wealth effects on spending stemming from higher house and equity prices.  Consequently, it seems likely that consumption growth will gradually return to around its trend rate of increase over the next twelve months.  Demand and output 17 Investment demand Whole-economy investment increased by 2.9% in Q4 and the level of investment in Q3 was revised up by 1% relative to the position reported in December.  Business and government investment both increased strongly in the fourth quarter, more than offsetting a 5.7% decline in private sector spending on dwellings.  The Q4 outturn for total investment was stronger than the MPC’s central projection at the time of the February Report. Investment reflects the difference between the current and desired levels of a firm’s capital stock.  This, in  turn, is influenced by the current level of capacity utilisation, expectations about future output and profits, the firm’s financial position, advances in technology,  and the cost of capital.  Unfortunately, the desired capital stock is not directly observable.  As a result, attention (at the macroeconomic level) is generally focused on proxy measures, such as the estimated deviation from trend of the capital stock to GDP ratio and survey measures of capacity utilisation rates and investment intentions. The ONS has recently published revised estimates for the capital stock, following the recommendations of a study undertaken by the National Institute.(1) This study highlighted the possibility that previous estimates of the UK capital stock were too large, since they failed to take enough account of capital scrapping in economic downturns and of the effects of rapid technological change.  In particular, there may have been an increasing amount of investment in assets with shorter lives, notably computers and related equipment. Chart 2.12 shows the business sector capital stock to output ratio on the basis of the new figures.  As a result of revised assumptions about the service lives of assets, the estimated level of the net capital stock in 1997 is now around 4% lower than previously thought.  Despite the strong growth in business investment over the past four years, the capital stock to output ratio has only just returned to its long-run average.  The revisions may help to explain why business spending on capital has exceeded the MPC’s expectations recently, and suggest that this year’s growth rate of investment may not slow by as much as had been previously thought.

Inflation Report:  May 1999 18 Turning to the other influences on investment, the real cost of borrowing faced by firms continues to fall. Interest rates have been reduced further in the past few months;  the London clearing banks’ base rate is now at its lowest level since 1994 Q3.  And equity prices have rebounded strongly since October, with the FT-SE All-Share index reaching new highs in April (see Section 1). The latest BCC survey found that profit expectations among service sector firms recovered in 1999 Q1. Correspondingly, investment intentions in the sector have also improved.  Although these intentions remain below the levels observed in 1997, they are close to the balances recorded during 1994–96 (see Chart 2.13), suggesting that further growth in service sector investment is likely. However, BCC survey results suggest that investment intentions among manufacturers remain significantly weaker than for service sector companies.  The CBI’s measure of capacity utilisation in manufacturing remains well below the levels reached at the end of 1997.  And, although there has been an improvement in confidence about future turnover and profitability, the balance of manufacturing firms expecting to authorise more capital spending remains low by historical standards (see Chart 2.14). The turn of the Millennium is also likely to affect the profile of investment between 1999 and 2000,  with spending both on construction projects and IT equipment being brought forward, boosting investment this year.  Around 40% of firms contacted by the  Bank’s Agents in April indicated that they still had outstanding Millennium-related investment spending plans.  About two thirds of this expenditure was expected to be additional, rather than displacing other investment. Overall, the prospects for business investment growth have improved relative to the position three months  ago.  The MPC has therefore revised its central projection upwards;  in 1999, the annual growth rate  of business investment is expected to slow to around its trend rate of increase.  Given the recent improvement in indicators of housing market activity, private sector investment spending on dwellings (which makes up around 15% of total investment) is also likely to strengthen this year. 20 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Percentage point balances Investment intentions  (plant and machinery) Profit expectations + _ 1989 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 _ Percentage point balances 1989 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 20 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Capacity utilisation (CBI) Profit expectations (BCC) Investment intentions (BCC) 99 + Chart 2.13 Influences on services investment Source:  BCC. Chart 2.14 Influences on manufacturing investment Sources:  CBI and BCC.  Demand and output 19 General government investment is estimated to have increased by 9.1% in Q4, and the level of public investment in the first three quarters of the year was also revised upwards since the February Report.  The March Budget maintained the government’s commitment to increase the ratio of public sector net investment to GDP to 1% by financial year 2001–02.  Since net investment was only 0.4% of GDP in 1998–99, the growth rate of government capital expenditure is likely to remain robust. Inventory investment Whole-economy inventories (excluding the alignment adjustment) increased by £0.7 billion (at 1995 prices) in Q4, in line with the rise in Q3.  Inventory levels in the distributive trades sector were broadly unchanged in the fourth quarter and they fell in the manufacturing sector (see Chart 2.15).  Consequently, most of the stockbuilding was concentrated in other sectors of the economy.  Evidence from the Bank’s Agents and the CBI suggests that concern about stock levels among manufacturers and distributors diminished in 1999 Q1 (see Chart 2.16).  However, there was a pick-up in the CBI Distributive Trades Survey measure of stocks relative to expected sales in April.  Overall, the MPC’s central projection continues to be that stockbuilding will detract from output growth this year.  The recent improvement in the survey evidence does suggest, however, that the size of the unwanted inventory overhang may not be as large as the MPC had previously thought likely.  Precautionary stockbuilding ahead of the Millennium may also affect the quarterly profile of inventory investment. Public sector demand Real general government consumption increased by 1.7% in the year to 1998 Q4.  In assessing the outlook for the public finances, the MPC has taken as its central case the nominal government expenditure plans and effective tax rates from the 9 March Budget statement. The Government intends to expand current nominal spending on goods and services by 5.3% this financial year.  Given that current spending is estimated to have increased by 4.7% in 1998–99, the growth rate of real government consumption is likely to rise.  But, the overall stance of fiscal policy is not expected to  change much—HM Treasury estimate that the government’s cyclically adjusted net borrowing position will decrease by 0.1% of GDP between 1998–99 and 1999–2000.

Inflation Report:  May 1999 20 2.3 Output According to the preliminary estimate, GDP (at constant market prices) increased by 0.1% in 1999 Q1.  This, together with revisions to previous quarters, lowered the annual rate of increase to 0.7% (see Chart 2.17), a little below the MPC’s central projection at the time of the February Report.  The level of the basic price measure of GDP in 1998 Q4 has been reduced by 0.2% since the January National Accounts release, while the level of the market price measure has been lowered by 0.5%.  These revisions were mainly the result of lower estimates of VAT receipts and company profits. The strength of economic activity across different sectors of the economy continues to differ markedly (see Chart 2.18).  Industrial production fell by 1.2% between December and February, leaving the average level in the first two months of 1999 0.2% lower than a year earlier. In contrast, service sector output increased by 0.4% in 1999 Q1, and by 2.3% in the year to Q1.  Much of this divergence has been linked to the industrial sector’s greater exposure to international competition.  However, longer-term structural factors (such as technological progress) have also played a role in the growth of services relative to industrial production.  Such considerations have been particularly pronounced in the communications sector (see the box opposite). Manufacturing output fell again in February, its sixth monthly decline in seven months.  Survey evidence suggests that output may have continued to fall in March.  However, there are some signs that the rate of contraction may be easing.  The CBI’s measure of business optimism improved to -6 in April, from -40 in January, and the balance of firms expecting to increase output over the next four months has become steadily less negative since October (see Chart 2.19).  Similarly, although the BCC’s latest survey continued to indicate lower sales and orders in Q1, the pace of the contraction in orders appears to have moderated.  And, although remaining below the neutral level of 50, the aggregate index of conditions in the manufacturing sector, produced by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS), has been rising since October. Construction output remained weak in the fourth quarter, rising by just 0.1%, following declines in Q2 and Q3. However, the growth rate of activity may have increased in Q1—the volume of new construction orders rose by 2.2% in the second half of 1998 and the CIPS survey of 1993 94 95 96 97 98 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Percentage changes on a year earlier Manufacturing Services GDP + _ Chart 2.18 Annual growth rate of GDP 1993 94 95 96 97 98 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Quarter on a year earlier Quarter on previous quarter Percentage changes 99 Chart 2.17 GDP growth rate(a) (a) At 1995 market prices. 1990 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 50 40 30 20 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 Percentage balances Percentage change on previous quarter ONS data (left-hand scale) Expected output (a) (right-hand scale) + _ 99 + _ Chart 2.19 Manufacturing output Sources:  CBI and ONS.

Demand and output 21 The growth rate of the communications sector (defined as postal and telecommunications services) has averaged about 5% per year since 1960 and 10% per year since the 1990–92 recession.  Communications has been one of the fastest-growing sectors of the economy, accounting for a rising share of output (up from around 1.4% of GDP in 1955 to 3.7% of GDP in 1998). This rapid growth in demand for communications services has had beneficial spill-over effects for the manufacturing sector.  As Chart A shows, production of electrical and optical equipment (which includes much of the hardware used in telecommunications) has increased by more than 40% since 1991, while total manufacturing output has increased by only around 9%.  In addition, improvements in communications technology will also have had beneficial productivity effects for other sectors of the economy. Similar trends are evident in households’ spending patterns.  In recent years, increases in spending on communications services and audio-visual equipment (which includes mobile phones and computers) have far exceeded the rise in total consumption (see Chart B). Total call minutes provided by the telecommunications sector have increased at an average annual rate of around 10% over the past four years.  Given the rising demand for Internet services and mobile phones (subscriptions to mobile phone networks increased by almost 27% in the year to March 1998), further strong demand growth seems likely. Reflecting these developments, increases in the share prices of telecommunications companies have far exceeded the rise in the overall stock market since 1980. The high price-earnings multiples for these companies indicate that the market expects the sector’s strong growth in turnover to continue. Rising demand for telecommunication services has partly reflected sizable price reductions.  Since 1992, prices for household telephone services have fallen on average by almost 3% per year.  Given the rise in other retail prices over this period, the relative price of communications services has declined even more sharply (see Chart C). These price declines have been driven by a number of factors.  In particular, advances in technology have enabled significant productivity improvements.  Since the beginning of the recovery in 1992, output per head has increased by about 75% in the communications sector, compared with 15% for the whole economy.  This productivity improvement was also influenced by the privatisation of British Telecom, increasing competition, and the regulatory pricing formula used by Oftel. 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190 1991 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 Electrical and  optical equipment Communications services 1991 Q1 = 100 Total manufacturing Total services 1991 93 95 97 99 65 75 85 95 105 Jan. 1991 = 100 Retail prices of  telephone services Communications  equipment 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190 200 1991 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 1991 Q1 = 100 Communications services Audio-visual  equipment Total Chart A Output by sector at 1995 prices Chart C Relative price of communications Chart B Consumption by sector at 1995 prices Note: The price of communications-related equipment is defined relative to the producer  price index.

The communications industry The communications sector provides a good example of the way in which changes in technology and tastes have led to rapid expansion in the service sector.  Inflation Report:  May 1999 22 construction activity rose to 57.4 in April, up from 45.5 in Q4. Despite the slowdown in the growth rate of services output in Q1, the sentiment of firms in this sector has improved in recent months.  BCC measures of sales and orders for domestic and export markets rose in the first quarter, and confidence about turnover has bounced back from last year’s lows (see Chart 2.20).  Similarly, the CIPS indicator of service sector business expectations has improved steadily since September, and their overall index of current activity increased to 56.3 in April, above the neutral level of 50.  2.4 Summary In the Committee’s judgment, the prospects for overall activity have changed relatively little since the February Report, but the composition of demand is likely to be different.  The central projection for domestic demand growth has been revised upwards, reflecting the  pick-up in consumer and business confidence,  stronger-than-expected investment, and the impact of lower interest rates.  In addition, the downside risks to output from a significant stock cycle appear to have diminished relative to the position three months ago.  But the stronger stimulus to output is likely to be largely offset by a weaker outlook for net trade.  Reflecting these considerations, the MPC’s central forecast continues to be for a gradual improvement in the growth rate of GDP during the course of 1999.  1990 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 1.0 0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 15 25 35 45 55 65 75 Percentage balances Percentage change  on previous quarter ONS data (left-hand scale) Confidence about turnover (right-hand scale) + 99 Sources:  BCC and ONS.

Nominal earnings growth fell during the second half of 1998, according to the reinstated Average Earnings Index (AEI) and other indicators.  The AEI headline rate picked up slightly to 4.6% in February, but other measures pointed to a further moderation in nominal earnings growth in the first quarter of this year. Earnings growth is likely to have been boosted in April by the introduction of the National Minimum Wage and the implementation of the public sector pay review body awards.  Unemployment has risen slightly and total hours worked have been flat.  But unemployment rates remain close to 20-year lows, and employment has continued to grow quite strongly, matched by a fall in inactivity.  The number of job vacancies is still high relative to unemployment.  But business surveys suggest that skill shortages have abated somewhat, and most measures of employment intentions have fallen further. 3.1 Earnings The official Average Earnings Index (AEI) was reinstated by the ONS on 2 March, following an independent review of the series commissioned by the Chancellor.  The box on the next page summarises the main findings of the review and the methodological changes made.  Chart 3.1 compares the new  headline measure of average earnings growth—a  backward-looking three-month moving average rather than a centred measure as previously—with the version suspended on 2 November last year, and with its predecessor, which was last updated on 6 October. The new measure rises steadily from mid 1995 to a peak of 5.7% in June 1998—above the peaks in the previous two series—before falling back sharply to 4.5% in December 1998 and January 1999.  Headline earnings growth rose slightly to 4.6% in February. As the box discusses, the ONS is carrying out further work to improve the quality of the AEI.  Until this work is completed, it is hard to know how much weight to place on the index.  In some respects, the new series presents fewer interpretational difficulties than the suspended measure.  First, there is no longer a marked  Inflation Report:  May 1999 24 Background The Average Earnings Index (AEI) is a measure of the growth in whole-economy average weekly earnings per head.  It is constructed from monthly survey data on the pay bills and employment of a sample of employers, grouped by size and industrial sector.  To make the sample representative of the economy as a whole, returns from each employer in the sample are first scaled up by a ‘grossing factor’.  The less comprehensive the sample’s coverage of that type of employer, the larger the grossing factor.  Average earnings in each sector are calculated  by dividing total pay by total employment.  And  whole-economy average earnings are derived from these industry measures, combined using sectoral employment weights. The AEI was first published in its present form in 1989. The sample of employers was partly updated in 1994 and early 1998, but the grossing factors and sectoral employment weights remained fixed at their initial values until 14 October last year, when (among other things) the employment weights used in the published series were updated and the new Interdepartmental Business Register was used to reclassify firms and update the grossing factors.  These revisions had a significant impact on the index, and on 23 October the Chancellor commissioned an independent review of the new series.  On  2 November, the ONS decided to suspend the AEI while the review took place.  The review was published on  2 March 1999.(1) Main findings of the review G The review found, first, that responses from some individual firms in the sample were having an excessive influence on the AEI.  The AEI sample was known to under-represent some important parts of the economy, particularly those with a high concentration of smaller firms (mainly in the service sectors).  To compensate for this, grossing factors applied to smaller firms in the sample were increased sharply in the October 1998 revisions.  But this made the aggregate index much more sensitive to the returns of a relatively small number of employers, some of whom reported volatile wages from month to month.  For example, the smallest size band in the financial intermediation sector consisted of only two firms.  Between April and May 1998, large increases in these firms’ reported wages contributed nearly  1 percentage point to the rise in the recorded growth rate of the suspended AEI.   To bring the AEI up to best practice, the review emphasised that the sample must be expanded and made more representative.  In the shorter term, it proposed that small financial intermediation firms be given a lower weight in the index, that the private health and social work sector be excluded from the index before June 1998, and that the ‘other business services’ sector be consolidated with the rest of the business services sector.  The review also recommended that erratic individual returns or ‘outliers’ should be more formally analysed and— where particularly volatile—given a reduced  weight. G Second, historical AEI growth rates were being influenced on a monthly basis not only by changes in respondents’ average earnings, but also by changes in sample composition and changes in the grossing factors applied to firms.  If a firm paying relatively high wages fell out of the sample (because it had ceased to trade or had forgotten to report) measured growth in the old index would fall, even if the average earnings growth of all reporting firms remained the same.  AEI growth rates were also being affected by monthly reassessments of firm size, which sometimes caused sharp changes in the grossing factors applied to individual firms. To address these problems, the review recommended that monthly AEI growth rates be calculated using only those returns from a ‘matched sample’ of employers reporting in both months.  And the grossing factors applied to firms should be changed less frequently, at the same time as the sectoral employment weights, and in a way that did not affect monthly growth rates. G Third, the ONS had faced difficulties allocating some employers to sub-categories within the public sector and, separately, within the agriculture, fisheries and foods sector.  The review therefore recommended that each sector should be consolidated into a single unit. Next steps All of the short-term changes recommended by the review were adopted in the new AEI published on  2 March.  Data based on the improved sample—which is crucial to help bring the AEI up towards best statistical practice—together with statistical measures of volatility in the AEI should begin to be available from September. The ONS is to report to the Economic Secretary to the Treasury by the end of 1999 on the progress made towards implementation of these and the other recommendations of the review.

Second, the new series is, broadly speaking, more consistent with other earnings  measures over the past few years (see Chart 3.2).(1) And third, measured earnings growth is less volatile  than it was on the suspended measure (see Table 3.A). Nevertheless, the new AEI can still move sharply over short periods:  for example, the pick-up in the headline measure in February partly reflected a rise in the  twelve-month growth rate of earnings, from 4.2% in December 1998 to 5.0% in February.  This makes it harder to draw inferences about the underlying trend of earnings growth.  Other indicators—including the Reward Index and surveys from the Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services (FRES) on the pay of permanent and temporary staff—suggest that annual earnings growth continued to fall in the first quarter of 1999.  The FRES measures picked up slightly in April. Earnings growth can be expressed as the sum of  wage settlements and a term known as ‘wage drift’.   The Bank’s estimate of the twelve-month  employment-weighted mean settlement has been stable between 3.6% and 3.7% since April 1998.  So arithmetically, most of the sharp slowdown—and subsequent slight pick-up—in the annual growth of the official average earnings measure since June last year can be accounted for by changes in wage drift (see  Chart 3.3).  Wage drift includes factors such as bonuses, overtime payments, shift premia, merit pay,  profit-related pay, and compositional shifts in the workforce.  So movements in earnings growth since June primarily reflect changes in some or all of these components. Some of the fall in wage drift probably reflects slower growth in bonuses.  Until January this year, firms in the AEI sample were asked to record the amount of bonuses or commissions paid, but only if there had been a significant change.  One difficulty with using these data to measure bonus growth is that bonuses not thought to have changed significantly would not have been (1) The National Accounts wages and salaries measure is benchmarked on an annual basis to estimates of pay data compiled from employers’ tax returns.  These annual data are independent of the AEI, but are only available with a lag.  The quarterly profile is based on data from the AEI, the Workforce jobs series and other sources, subject to a number of technical adjustments.  Some of these adjustments had a significant effect on the growth profile during 1998, and are currently under review by the ONS.

Inflation Report:  May 1999 26 captured.  If some reporting firms thought that payments in a particular month had changed significantly in one year, but not in the same month in the previous year (or vice versa), measured twelve-month growth rates of bonuses would be biased.  Subject to this caveat,  Table 3.B shows that bonuses and commissions recorded in this way boosted earnings growth in the first half of 1998, but were having little or no effect on earnings growth by the three-month period ending in January this year. One reason for paying bonuses is to reward staff for past productivity and profitability gains.  So some of the fall in bonus growth in the second half of 1998 may reflect the slowdown in corporate profit and productivity growth.  But bonuses are also paid to maintain and improve staff retention, so a decline in bonus growth may also signal looser labour market conditions. Although current unemployment has been close to  20-year lows, concerns about future unemployment rose sharply in the second half of last year, according  to the GfK survey (see Chart 3.4).  This may have  reduced the need for firms to make special payments during that period to retain staff.  Respondents to the GfK survey have become less concerned about future unemployment in recent months, consistent with the more general improvement in consumer confidence (see Section 2). It is not possible to identify the contribution of bonuses to the rise in annual earnings growth in February. Starting from February, firms in the AEI sample have been asked to record all bonuses paid, and not just those they consider to be significant.  In the longer run, this should remove the problems with the previous approach. But the substantially higher number of firms now reporting bonuses means that measured annual growth rates are likely to overstate the true rate of bonus growth until February 2000.  In principle, this change should affect only the split of total recorded pay between bonus and non-bonus components:  firms have always been asked to report their total gross pay.  It is possible, however, that some firms have begun reporting bonuses as part of total pay, when previously they had not.(1) That would have raised the recorded annual growth rate of overall earnings in February.  But the ONS says that it has found no evidence of this occurring. (1) The AEI review noted that the reporting arrangements left a degree of ambiguity over whether or not to include bonuses in total pay.  Firms have been reminded by the ONS of the need to include all bonuses.

The labour market 27 Earnings growth has also been depressed by a fall in overtime payments in recent months.  Overtime is sensitive to demand conditions:  in the past, there has been a close relationship between the annual growth in overtime payments as measured by the New Earnings Survey and the annual growth of nominal GDP (see Chart 3.5).  Consistent with the slowdown in output growth, the average number of paid overtime hours per worker in the six months to February was about 8% lower than in the same period a year earlier, according to more recent data from the Labour Force Survey. A third factor likely to have put downward pressure on nominal earnings growth is the fall in inflation expectations over the past twelve months.   Wage-bargainers care about the expected real value of earnings—workers because it determines their expected ability to purchase goods and services, and firms because it determines their expected real labour costs.  When inflation expectations fall, a given rise in expected real wages can be achieved with a lower increase in nominal wages.  Most of the measures of one year ahead inflation expectations from the Barclays Basix Survey fell further between 1998 Q4 and 1999 Q1 (see Table 3.C), and have fallen markedly since the first half of 1998.  Other surveys show a similar pattern. Consistent with the fall in inflation expectations, average employment-weighted wage settlements in 1998 Q4 and 1999 Q1 were lower than in the same periods a year earlier, reversing the previous upward trend (see  Chart 3.6).  These declines were fairly broadly based. According to the Bank’s database, more than 80% of employees covered by settlements concluded in the first quarter of the year received a lower settlement in 1999 than in 1998 (see Chart 3.7). Increases in the pay of some workers to meet the requirements of the National Minimum Wage, outside the standard settlement, are likely to have put some upward pressure on earnings growth in recent months. The National Minimum Wage formally came into effect on 1 April, but there appears to have been significant anticipation, with some firms beginning to pay the National Minimum Wage last autumn and some implementing rises in stages over a period of time. Earnings growth will also have been affected by the implementation of the public sector pay review body awards, which raised the wages of the 1.2 million workers covered by an average of 4.1% on 1 April.

In the chart, LFS data are centred around  March, June, September and December, for comparability with the  Workforce jobs measure. The awards, which unlike last year’s settlements will  not be phased in over the year, are likely to add around 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points to annual growth in  whole-economy average earnings between April and December.  Average earnings in the public sector have been growing less rapidly than private sector pay since early 1993, but have slowed less sharply since the middle of last year.  Overall, however, the news since the February Report suggests that the pressures on nominal earnings growth have eased somewhat.  In light of the slowdown in earnings growth since last summer, the fall in inflation expectations, the reduction in settlements during the first quarter of this year and evidence on the determinants of wage drift, the MPC has lowered the profile for nominal earnings growth in its central projection relative to that in the February Report.  3.2 Employment and unemployment Pay pressure is influenced by both the degree and the rate of change of labour market tightness.  Although quantity indicators give a mixed picture, most suggest that labour market pressures have eased slightly, but remain significant by recent historical standards. Whole-economy employment has continued to grow quite strongly (see Chart 3.8).  Labour Force Survey (LFS) employment rose by 80,000 (0.3%) in the three months to February, and the Workforce jobs measure rose by 48,000 (0.2%) in 1998 Q4. But while the number of people in work rose, average hours worked fell, leaving total hours worked—in principle, a better measure of labour usage—unchanged in the three months to February (see Table 3.D).  The fall in average hours reflected two main factors.  First, average hours worked by those in full-time employment fell by 0.5% in the three months to February, consistent with a fall in overtime.  And second, a relatively large proportion of recent employment growth was accounted for by a rise in part-time workers, who typically work about 40% of the hours of full-timers. It is possible that some of the strength of recent employment growth may have reflected firms taking on staff in the expectation that demand growth will soon pick up again.  The Bank’s regional Agents conducted a survey of their contacts’ employment intentions in March.  Some of those planning to recruit were doing so even though they considered their staffing to be more Chart 3.7 Differences between wage settlements in  1998 and 1999 for those settling in  Q1 in both years(a) 0 10 20 30 40 50 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 Percentage of employees covered 3 _ + Change in settlement (percentage points) Source:  Bank of England.

Employment has grown relatively rapidly compared with the growth in output since the mid 1990s.  Consequently, annual growth in the official measure of whole-economy labour productivity—the amount of output per employed person—has averaged only about 11/2% since 1995, below the longer-run historical average of around 2% (see Chart 3.9).  Developments in labour productivity are important for assessing inflationary pressures.  A change in the rate of labour productivity growth which is not reflected in earnings growth affects firms’ unit labour costs.  And, in the longer run, real earnings should rise in line with trend productivity growth. There is no strong evidence that the trend rate of labour productivity growth has shifted:  since the start of the 1990s recovery, productivity growth has averaged just over 2%, in line with the longer-run average.  But the cyclical behaviour of productivity growth does appear to have been different in the 1990s.  Historically, productivity growth has tended to rise strongly during the early part of a recovery and to fall sharply during  a downturn, reflecting the delayed response of employment to changes in output.  During the 1990s, cyclical swings in productivity have been rather less pronounced.  This is likely to have reflected a range of influences.  But one possible factor is that the labour market reforms of the last two decades, together with other structural changes in the economy, have increased the speed and flexibility with which employers can adjust both the number of employees and the amount of hours worked in response to changes in demand.  In its central projection for inflation, the MPC has assumed that productivity growth will continue to be somewhat less cyclical over the forecast period. Aggregate unemployment has risen slightly, having been stable or falling during last year.  LFS unemployment rose by 32,000 in the three months to February, and the claimant count increased slightly in February and March. The LFS measure of redundancies in the three months to February was 52,000 higher than a year earlier.   Short-term LFS unemployment, the number of people unemployed for less than one year, has been rising since May last year (see Chart 3.10).  The duration structure of unemployment may contain useful information on inflationary pressures in the labour market.

So, for a given level of unemployment, a rise in the share accounted for by the recently employed may increase the stock of relevant skills available to firms, putting downward pressure on wages.  But if the recent rise in the number of short-term unemployed reflects an increasing mismatch between the skills demanded by firms and those offered by people who have recently moved into unemployment, the implications for wage pressure are less straightforward.  Although both  short-term and whole-economy unemployment measures have risen recently, unemployment rates remain low by recent historical standards (see Chart 3.10). The recent rise in both employment and unemployment was associated with a decline in the number of people who are economically inactive (those who are neither employed nor actively searching for work).  The inactivity rate has been falling since early 1998, having been broadly flat since the start of the 1990s recovery. The extent to which changes in employment are associated with changes in inactivity rather than changes in unemployment affects the prospects for inflation, because the inactive are assumed to exert less downward pressure on earnings than the unemployed.  In the past, inactivity has tended to be counter-cyclical, falling in recoveries as people are attracted out of inactivity into searching for—and acquiring—work, and rising in downturns.  So changes in unemployment have usually been rather smaller than changes in employment (see Chart 3.11).  During the 1990s recovery, however, the normal cyclical pattern has been weakened by a trend rise in the number of students and long-term sick.  The MPC has taken account of this in its inflation projections. Indicators of job vacancies and skill shortages provide an alternative way of assessing the relationship between the supply of, and unsatisfied demand for, labour.  Vacancy measures have fallen:  in March, the official number of Jobcentre vacancies was 12,400 below its peak in November last year, and the NTC Press Recruitment Advertising Index was at its lowest level since  December 1996.  Recent Jobcentre data have been distorted by reporting problems in Northern Ireland and the West Midlands, the net effect of which is that the official vacancy data probably overstate the true rise in vacancies since early 1998.  But even excluding these factors, vacancies remain high relative to unemployment when compared with the previous cycle (see Chart 3.12).

Data are also adjusted for an overstated stock of vacancies from 1996 Q2 onwards caused by difficulties with the Jobcentre computer system.  The labour market 31 Alternative measures of the relationship between vacancies and unemployment, based on Jobcentre vacancy and unemployment inflows, suggest a similar picture.  Skill shortages and recruitment difficulties  have also eased since last year, according to business surveys (see Chart 3.13).  The CBI survey suggests that the constraint on output posed by skill shortages is now well below average in manufacturing.  But, despite  recent falls, BCC measures of recruitment difficulties— which cover both skilled and unskilled labour—remain well above average in both services and manufacturing, consistent with continued labour market tightness. Business surveys suggest that employment intentions have weakened since the middle of last year (see  Table 3.E).  After seasonal adjustment, the Manpower whole-economy survey balance stayed below its  long-run average in 1999 Q1.  The outlook for manufacturing employment is still weak on all measures, although the BCC and CBI surveys suggest that the rate of decline in employment intentions may have slowed in Q1.  Employment intentions in the service sector— which accounts for a much larger share of total employment—remain rather stronger, according to the BCC and Manpower measures.  The survey of contacts carried out by the Bank’s regional Agents in March found a similar picture, with more than half of manufacturers reporting that employment levels were expected to be lower over the next six months, but more than three quarters of service sector firms expecting to maintain or raise employment. Previous Reports have set out the MPC’s analysis of  the implications for inflation of recent Government policies designed to affect the supply of and demand for labour, including the New Deal and the Working Families Tax Credit.  The March Budget contained  a number of further measures.  In forming its latest inflation projection the MPC has decided not to adjust its assumptions.  But these assumptions will be kept under regular review as further data and research become available. 3.3 Summary The labour market remains tight.  Unemployment is close to 20-year lows, employment has continued to grow, inactivity has fallen, and the stock of job vacancies remains high relative to the level of unemployment.

Inflation Report:  May 1999 32 National Minimum Wage in April, are likely to continue to underpin earnings growth in the next few months.   Nevertheless, there have been signs of an easing in labour market conditions since the February Report. Nominal earnings growth has moderated since last summer, according to the newly reinstated Average Earnings Index and other measures, and wage settlements have begun to fall, consistent with the slowdown in the growth of output and profits, and a reduction in inflation expectations.  Unemployment has risen slightly, the number of hours worked has been flat, skill shortages have abated, and surveys of employment intentions suggest that employment growth may decline in the coming months.  Taken together, and compared with the February Report, these factors point to somewhat weaker inflationary pressures from the labour market over the forecast period.  33 Costs and prices 4 RPIX inflation has remained stable and close to target since July 1998.  The oil price has risen since the February Report, though prices of other commodities have generally continued to fall.  And the appreciation of sterling’s effective exchange rate since February is likely to place further downward pressure on imported goods prices.  UK producer prices have reflected the rise in the oil price, but overall cost pressures in the manufacturing sector remain subdued.  Inflation has remained higher for services than for goods, though business surveys suggest that cost pressures in the service sector have eased. 4.1 Raw materials and commodity prices Brent crude oil prices rose to around $15 per barrel at the end of March, following a twelve-year low of less than $10 per barrel at the end of 1998.  The rise in oil prices was prompted by production cuts by OPEC.  Since these were introduced in April, prices have risen further, and averaged $16 per barrel over the two weeks to  5 May, similar to the prices prevailing at the end of 1997.  The MPC has assumed that oil prices will remain around current levels over the forecast period. In contrast to oil prices, world prices of raw materials and non-oil commodities have generally continued to fall.  The Economist index of non-oil commodity prices measured in US dollars was around 5% lower in the three months to April compared with the previous three months, and some 17% lower than a year earlier.  The IMF, World Bank, OECD and Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) project lower average prices in 1999 than in 1998.  That is largely a result of the further broadly based price falls seen in early 1999.  Higher prices are forecast for 2000 than in 1999 (see Table 4.A).  The Bank’s sterling non-oil commodity price index is weighted by UK demand and has a higher weight for wholesale food, including UK produce, than the Economist index.(1) Prices of some of the non-oil Table 4.A Non-oil commodity prices in US dollars: forecasts for 1999 and 2000 Annual average percentage changes on a year earlier 1998 Outturn (a) 1999 (b) 2000 EIU -16.1 -8.6 6.8 IMF -14.8 -4.0 1.8 OECD -14.0 -6.2 0.3 World Bank -15.6 -10.6 3.0 (a) 1998 outturns vary because of the different composition of the  basket of goods used in the indices. (b) All forecasts were published in April/May 1999. (1) The Bank’s index is available on a monthly basis and is compared with the Economist index because it is also updated frequently.  The other indices which are shown in Table 4.A are available only on a quarterly basis, though are based on broader weights than the Economist index.  Inflation Report:  May 1999 34 commodities measured by the Bank index have risen since the beginning of the year and the annual rate of deflation of the index has declined (see Chart 4.1).  The fall in wholesale food prices has accounted for more than half of the fall in the Bank’s non-oil commodity price index since its peak in December 1995 (see Table 4.B). This partly reflects the impact of changes in sterling intervention prices under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and falling livestock prices.  But wholesale food prices have risen since January. The February Report noted that, since 1 January 1999, intervention prices under the CAP have been calculated in euros and translated into sterling using the market exchange rate.  Intervention prices in sterling fell during 1999 Q1 as sterling appreciated against the euro.  The ‘Agenda 2000’ package, which includes further changes to the CAP, was agreed by EU Member States at the end of March.  The agreed cuts to intervention prices are less than those originally proposed by the European Commission.  Price reductions are to be phased in over a few years for cereals and beef, and the reduction in milk prices will not be implemented until 2005–06.  The impact on the inflation rate is therefore likely to be negligible over the forecast period. The MPC’s central projection assumes that the fall in  non-oil commodity prices comes to an end in 1999 and, in line with other forecasts, that dollar prices of commodities increase in 2000. 4.2 Import prices and the exchange rate Sterling prices of imported goods and services fell by 5.7% in the year to 1998 Q4, and were 14.8% lower than in 1996 Q2, just prior to sterling’s marked appreciation. Goods account for around 80% of total UK imports and services 20%.  Since 1996 Q2, the prices of imported goods have fallen much more than those of services. Prices in sterling of imported goods have fallen by 16.5% since 1996 Q2, but those for services have fallen by 8.3%.  Over the past twelve months the prices of imported services have risen. Import prices both of goods and services were initially slow to respond to the appreciation of sterling.  Despite falling world prices for manufactures during 1997–98, the decline in imported goods prices broadly matched the extent of the appreciation only by 1998 Q4 as sterling fell back a little (see Chart 4.2).

Costs and prices 35 on UK sales, perhaps because they thought that the appreciation was temporary.  Section 1 discussed how, in 1997 and 1998, Consensus Economics forecasts showed a sharper projected fall in the real exchange rate than actually occurred.  The ratio of UK import prices of goods and services relative to average export prices of the United Kingdom’s major trading partners rose in 1997 (see Chart 4.3).  But it fell back in 1998 as overseas suppliers appear to have narrowed their relative margins on UK sales.  Falling world prices for semi-finished and finished manufactures suggest that excess global capacity and the increased competitiveness of Asian exports in world markets may have had an effect. Producer prices in local currencies in the major overseas economies, except the United States, continued to fall in January and February.  That, combined with the recent appreciation of the exchange rate, suggests some further falls in UK imported goods prices are likely.  The MPC’s central projection assumes that sterling import prices will be weaker than expected at the time of the February Report.  Import prices continue to fall in the first half of 1999 but rise thereafter, as the effects of sterling’s appreciation fade and world demand growth picks up. 4.3 Costs and prices in manufacturing Inflation in the manufacturing sector has remained subdued.  Recent increases in fuel prices have broadly offset continued falls in both input and output prices of other manufactured goods.   Input prices fell by 0.4% in 1999 Q1, the slowest rate of decline since 1997 Q3.   And the April Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) survey of manufacturing pointed to less steep falls in input prices than in the previous nine months.  Output prices rose in February and March as  a result of changes to excise duties and higher fuel prices.  Excluding excise duties, output prices were broadly flat in 1999 Q1 and were 0.7% lower than a year earlier.  The CBI survey measure—which in the past has moved fairly closely with producer output prices (see Chart 4.4)—points to small falls in prices over the next four months.   4.4 Costs and prices in the service sector Survey data for the service sector pointed to lower costs and output price inflation in the second half of 1998, but survey balances rose a little in 1999 Q1.  The CIPS services survey index of the cost of all inputs fell in the second half of 1998 but rose in the first four months of 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 1985 87 89 91 93 95 97 1995 = 100 1992 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 40 30 20 10 0 10 20 30 40 8 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 Four-month annualised  percentage changes Percentage balance Output price inflation (a)    (right-hand scale)  CBI price expectations (b)   (left-hand scale) + – + – Chart 4.3 Ratio of UK import prices to major six  overseas economies’ export prices(a) Chart 4.4 Producer output price inflation and the  CBI price expectations balance Sources:  CBI and ONS.

Inflation Report:  May 1999 36 1999.  The CIPS survey measure of prices charged was above the neutral level of 50 in March and April, following five months when the balance of responses was consistent with downward pressure on prices.  The BCC survey measure of output price inflation in the service sector was unchanged in 1999 Q1, though cost pressures from settlements and other overheads were reported to have increased. The ONS is developing an aggregate measure of corporate services output inflation (see page 35 of the February 1999 Report).  The twelve sub-component series which are published generally pointed to lower inflation in 1998 Q4:  six pointed to lower price increases in 1998 Q4 than in Q3 and two showed no change.  Three of the four series where price increases were higher related to the transport sector. 4.5 Retail prices Retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments (RPIX) inflation remained close to target in 1999 Q1. The rise in RPIX inflation in March, to 2.7%, was a result of the temporary effect of changes in the timing of excise duties announced in the Budget (see below). RPIY inflation, which also excludes indirect and local authorities’ taxes, fell to 1.7%.  The headline RPI inflation rate was unchanged at 2.1%, as a fall in mortgage interest payments offset the impact of  higher duties (see Chart 4.5).   The Budget in 1999 was earlier than in 1998, and increases in fuel duties took effect before the March collection date for the RPI.  Fuel duties therefore affected the March RPI this year but not last year. Increases in tobacco duties were brought forward to March from December.  These changes, if passed on in full, would have added around 0.4 percentage points to RPIX inflation in March.  The increase will be largely reversed in April when the 1998 increase in road fuel duties (of close to 0.3 percentage points) drops out of the annual inflation rate.  And in December 1999, the effect of last year’s increase in tobacco duties will drop out of the annual inflation rate. The February Report noted that services price inflation has been above that for goods since December 1996. The gap widened from 1.0 percentage points in 1997 Q1 to 2.3 percentage points in 1998 Q4, as falling import prices bore down on goods price inflation.  The gap remained wide in 1999 Q1.

RPIY = RPIX excluding VAT, local authorities’ taxes and excise duties. (a) Adjusted by the Bank of England for ONS error in under-recording  aggregate price indices between February and May 1995.  Other  charts and tables in this Report that include measures of retail price  inflation are similarly adjusted.  Costs and prices 37 a little lower at 3.4% in 1999 Q1, and goods price inflation rose by 0.1 percentage point to 1.3%. Services price inflation has moved more closely with measures of domestically generated inflation (DGI) than goods price inflation over the past two years because of the lower import content of services.  Measures of DGI provided mixed signals about the direction of inflationary pressure at the end of 1998 (see Chart 4.6). The measure of RPIX inflation excluding import prices fell to 4.5% in 1998 Q4, its lowest rate since 1996 Q3. Inflation measured by the GDP deflator excluding export prices has remained close to 4% since the beginning of 1996.  The unit labour costs inflation measure rose to 4.4%, as productivity slowed. The DGI measures derived from RPIX and the GDP deflator are a combination of  domestic weighted costs and a mark-up of prices over costs.(1) In the short run, pricing behaviour will depend on the reasons for changes in costs and their interaction with current and expected demand conditions.  Firms may delay adjusting prices fully to an increase in costs if they view the change to be temporary.  But firms may be quicker to respond to a change in costs that has affected all firms in the same way—for example, an increase in general wage pressure.  There is also some evidence for the United Kingdom that the mark-up of prices over costs tends to rise when demand increases, but with a short lag.  The strength of demand in 1997 and early 1998 probably boosted prices relative to costs.  The subsequent slowdown in demand will tend to put downward pressure on prices relative to costs.  Section 6 discusses the behaviour of prices relative to costs over the forecast period. 4.6 Other price indices The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) is constructed from the same price quotes as RPIX but it has a different coverage, and a different method of index construction, so that it is directly comparable with HICP inflation rates of other EU Member States.(2) In March, UK HICP inflation was 1.7%, 0.7 percentage points higher than euro-area inflation.  Eurostat has recently published estimates of HICP inflation for the euro area prior to 1997.  UK HICP inflation was a little below that of the euro area between January 1993 and June 1995, 1993 94 95 96 97 98 Percentage changes on a year earlier 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 RPIX excluding import prices + – GDP deflator excluding   export prices (a) Unit labour costs    adjusted for trend    productivity (b) Chart 4.6 Measures of domestically generated inflation (a) Using GDP measured at market prices.

(2) Further details on the construction of HICP were set out in the February 1999 Report, page 38 and in Economic Trends, December 1998.  Inflation Report:  May 1999 38 but has been above it since then (see Chart 4.7).  UK services price inflation has been considerably higher than that in the euro area since 1996 (see Chart 4.8). That is perhaps a result of higher domestically generated inflation in the United Kingdom than in the euro area since then.  By contrast, UK goods price inflation has generally been lower than that for the euro area.  In the past two years that has probably reflected the rise in sterling’s effective exchange rate. Underlying developments in the rate of inflation are sometimes masked by sharp movements in individual prices.  Such price changes should be included in a measure of the cost of living.  But it is also useful to look at inflation rates excluding erratic price movements to gauge underlying inflationary pressure.  The Bank looks at two measures which reduce the effect of extreme price movements:  the median inflation rate and the trimmed mean inflation rate, which excludes the highest and lowest 15% of price changes.  These measures usually lie below RPIX inflation, as the price increases excluded from the measures generally exceed the price falls excluded (see Chart 4.9).  The measures showed a more gradual build-up in inflation towards the peak in the early 1990s.   In the recent past they have reduced the fluctuations resulting from sharp movements in seasonal food price inflation, and changes in the timing of duties.  Inflation on these measures fell slightly in early 1999. Inflation measured by the consumers’ expenditure deflator rose to 2.3% in 1998 Q4 from 2.0% in Q3.   That led to a pick-up in the annual inflation rate of the GDP deflator at market prices, which measures  whole-economy inflation.  It rose to 2.6% in 1998 Q4 from 2.2% in Q3.   4.7 Summary RPIX inflation has remained stable and close to target since July 1998.  Oil prices have risen since the February Report, while the world prices of other commodities have continued to fall and import prices have declined further.  UK manufacturing output prices were broadly flat in 1999 Q1.  But in most major overseas economies they continued to fall.  Combined with the higher exchange rate, that points to some renewed downward pressure on UK goods prices from abroad.  Inflation in the service sector has persisted at annual rates of above 3%, though survey data have continued to point to lower increases in costs.

The recent appreciation of sterling may place renewed downward pressure on goods prices in the short run; thereafter, the gap between domestic and imported inflationary pressures is expected to narrow gradually.  40 5 Monetary policy since the February Report This section summarises the economic developments and monetary policy decisions taken by the MPC since the February Report.  The minutes of the February, March and April meetings and the press notice from the May meeting are attached as an Annex to this Report. The Bank of England’s official dealing rate—the repo rate—was reduced from 5.5% in February to 5.25% in April, and was maintained at that level in May. At the time of the February Report, the central projection was for RPIX inflation to remain close to target over the two-year forecast period.  The risks around the projection were broadly balanced in the first year but were slightly on the downside in the second year. Greater than usual uncertainty surrounded the forecast, partly because of the difficulty of assessing labour cost pressure.  Some Committee members took the view that the inflation profile should be somewhat lower, because of expectations of stronger productivity growth or weaker world prices than assumed in the central projection. At its meeting on 2–3 March, the Committee noted that the prospects for global activity and prices were little changed since the February Report.  Outside the major industrial countries, renewed difficulties in Brazil had led to a further weakening of the real;  but other South American currencies did not appear to be under pressure. Though the risk of contagion remained, it had not materialised.  The sterling effective exchange rate had risen by 2% since the February Report.  Sterling had appreciated against the euro but depreciated against the US dollar;  these movements possibly reflected changes in expectations about relative demand prospects for the euro area, United States and United Kingdom.  The stronger exchange rate would, by itself, tend to reduce import prices and retail prices.  But the Committee judged that it was too soon to tell whether the appreciation would persist. There were two key domestic activity developments. First, the composition of expenditure had been published for 1998 Q4 and this included a small downward revision to the level of GDP at market prices.  Inventory accumulation made a larger contribution to GDP growth  Monetary policy since the February Report 41 than in Q3, offset by a larger negative contribution from net trade, primarily because of weaker exports.  Second, surveys had picked up somewhat from lows in the autumn;  and the improvement had been broadly based, including both domestic and export activity.  These two developments could be interpreted in a number of ways. The lower level of GDP could point to weaker demand than previously thought.  And the weaker outturn for exports could point to some of the downside risks to external demand feeding through.  But the rise in survey data, albeit from low levels, might point to a slightly better picture than previously expected.  Overall, the Committee judged that activity was in line with what had been expected at the time of the February Report, but the improvement in survey data, if sustained, could prove significant. Nominal price and cost pressures appeared to have weakened in the second half of 1998.  The Average Earnings Index (AEI) had been published again, following the independent review.  The level of earnings at the end of 1998 on the newly published series was broadly in line with the assumption in the February Report.  But earnings growth in the first half of 1998 had been higher than previously thought, and had then slowed more markedly than had been assumed.  The rate of increase of wage settlements had also slowed, and the Reward Index had declined on a broadly similar path to the Average Earnings Index in 1998.  The effective exchange rate was higher, though oil prices had also risen.  On balance, these developments suggested slightly lower prospective inflation than thought at the time of the February Report.  In its discussion of the immediate policy decision, some members of the Committee considered that the news on the month did not amount to a sufficient case for a further reduction in interest rates.  More evidence was required on the exchange rate, earnings and confidence. Another view was that the central projection in the February Report had been around 0.2 percentage points too high—the news on the month had suggested weaker activity and inflation, and so justified a cut in interest rates of 25–50 basis points.  The Committee voted to leave the repo rate unchanged at 5.5%. At its meeting on 7–8 April, the Committee discussed whether prospects for the world economy had improved over the previous month.  In the United States, domestic demand had continued to grow strongly, with little sign of a pick-up in inflation.  But there were few signs of  Inflation Report:  May 1999 42 recovery in Japan.  Output remained below potential in a number of euro-area economies, though expectations of an easing of monetary policy had increased.  Spreads on emerging market debt had narrowed during the month. Sentiment and, in some cases, activity was a little stronger in parts of Asia and Latin America.  So the downside risks to activity highlighted in the February Report appeared to have diminished slightly.  There were some signs that the fall in commodity prices was coming to an end, and oil prices had risen sharply.  But with most economies outside the United States below their productive capacity, the Committee viewed the scope for a generalised pick-up in inflation as limited.  The main news on domestic activity was the revisions to the levels of GDP and composition of expenditure in 1997 and 1998.  The estimated level of GDP at market prices in 1998 Q4 had been reduced by 1/2%, but by only 1/4% when measured at basic prices.  The composition of expenditure showed an upward revision to consumption and investment, with business investment significantly higher.  But the revisions resulted in a larger negative contribution from net trade, largely as a result of higher imports.  At the same time, inventory accumulation was revised downwards, and suggested that the risks of a significant stock cycle in 1999 had diminished.  Survey evidence suggested an improvement in business confidence, albeit from a low base.  The Committee agreed that the Budget had little altered the outlook for inflation.  Overall, the prospects for activity remained broadly as expected at the time of the February Report.  In assessing the prospects for inflation, the Committee discussed the implications of lower earnings growth and settlements.  Earnings growth had remained on a downward trend;  but the implications for inflation would depend on a variety of factors including productivity and margins.  Productivity had been low relative to its long-run average over the past three years; so unit labour costs were correspondingly higher.  But the pass-through from unit labour costs to prices was not straightforward.  It would depend on cyclical conditions and on other input prices.  The Committee decided to consider these issues further in the context of the May Report.  The effective exchange rate had remained higher over the past month and was more than 2% higher than assumed in the February Report, which by itself would tend to dampen inflation. In its discussion of the immediate policy decision, the Committee considered that the prospects for activity  Monetary policy since the February Report 43 overall were little changed and that some of the previously identified downside risks to both the world and the UK economy appeared to have diminished.  The prospects for inflation had shifted further towards the downside.  The effective exchange rate was stronger, and nominal earnings growth seemed lower, than expected. Against this background, the Committee voted to cut the Bank’s repo rate by 0.25% to 5.25%. At its meeting on 5–6 May, the Committee voted to leave the repo rate unchanged at 5.25%.  44 6 Prospects for inflation 6.1 The inflation projection assumptions This Report, which the Committee approved on 7 May, contains the Committee’s assessment of developments in the economy since February, and prospects for the medium term.  Charts 6.1 and 6.2 below show projections for GDP growth and RPIX inflation up to two years ahead, and the uncertainties surrounding them. The projections assume that the Bank’s repo interest rate will remain unchanged at 5.25% during the next two years, and are conditioned on the assumptions described below. After successive downward revisions to global economic prospects through the autumn and winter months, there has been a slight improvement in the outlook for world activity since the February Report.  Momentum in the US economy appears stronger than judged earlier, raising forecast GDP growth there in 1999.  However, prospects for the euro area are slightly weaker than estimated three months ago.  Recent GDP growth has been sluggish, although the 0.5% cut in ECB interest rates in early April should support future activity.  The outlook for Japan remains depressed.  Outside the major industrial countries, there are some encouraging signs of recovery in the emerging Asian economies.  Interest rate spreads on emerging market debt over US Treasuries have fallen over the past three months, although they remain well above the levels of the first half of 1998. Overall, there has been a small upward revision to the central projection for global growth.  The MPC now assumes that growth in UK-weighted export markets will rise from 4%–5% in 1999 to the 5%–6% range in 2000, still well below the average over the 1990s.  Moreover, UK exporters may continue to lose market share, as the effects of the appreciation of sterling continue to work through.   Global inflationary pressures remain quite weak. Manufactured goods prices continue to edge down internationally as current demand falls short of production capacity.  And although some rise in non-oil commodity prices is assumed over the forecast period, they fell further than expected over the winter months. In contrast, oil prices have risen sharply recently, in response to the OPEC plan to scale back production.  The  Prospects for inflation 45 planned supply reduction has brought forward the recovery in oil prices projected in February.  Oil prices are expected to be higher in the short to medium term than anticipated in February, but no change is expected in the long-run level.  Taking these developments together, there is little change in the relatively subdued outlook for world inflation.  However, import prices in sterling are likely to be weaker than expected in the February Report, given the further appreciation of the exchange rate. The sterling exchange rate, as measured by the effective Exchange Rate Index (ERI), averaged 104.0 in the  15 working days up to and including 5 May.  This forms the starting-point for the exchange rate profile assumed in the projection.  It compares with a starting-point of 100.1 at the time of the February Report and an implied level of 99.4 for May.  The starting-point for the exchange rate is thus some 41/2% higher than the path assumed in February.  The recent rise has been particularly marked against the euro.  Changes in market perceptions of future interest rates at home and abroad could account for a significant portion of the recent increase in sterling. The MPC takes both interest rate differentials and risk factors into account in formulating assumptions on the path of sterling.  In the central projection, the sterling ERI declines to 99.6 by the end of the two-year forecast period, consistent with bilateral sterling exchange rates of about $1.62 and 0.69 against the euro (equivalent to DM 2.82).  On average, sterling is expected to decline more steeply than in the central projection.  Outside forecasts reported by Consensus Economics imply that the exchange rate is expected to decline more rapidly than in the central projection, reaching 96.7 after two years.  But some Committee members considered that the balance of risks around the central projection for the exchange rate was on the upside. The MPC continues to base the central projection on the Government’s announced public spending plans and forecasts of effective tax rates.  The May projections are based on the March Budget.  There is relatively little difference in the overall fiscal stance from the autumn pre-Budget statement, which formed the basis for the February projection.  Lower levels of social security transfers offset the reduction in taxation announced in the Budget. The National Minimum Wage came into effect on 1 April, following the introduction of the Working Time  Inflation Report:  May 1999 46 Directive in October 1998 and the New Deal in early 1998.  Previous projections incorporated assumptions about the effects of these labour market reforms.  No changes have been made to these assumptions in the central projection, although the upside risk to earnings from a stronger minimum wage impact has been reduced. 6.2 The medium-term inflation projection Output rose marginally in the first quarter of 1999 according to the preliminary GDP release in April.  The outturn was close to the flat central projection in the February Report, and by itself contained little news. However, prior to this, the February GDP release and the National Accounts published in March revised down the level of GDP and altered the estimated composition of demand in recent quarters.  At the end of 1998, the level of GDP measured at market prices was around 1/2% lower than previously estimated, although only 1/4% lower when measured in basic prices.  The implications of those revisions to output for future inflation are ambiguous.  On the one hand, the lower level of activity could indicate a reduction in pressures on capacity which, depending on the lags, could dampen future inflation.  On the other, the short-run trade-off between activity and inflation could be less favourable than previously thought.  The Committee concluded that, on either view, the revisions were not large enough to warrant a material change in the assessment of inflationary pressures. The composition of demand in the second half of 1998 differed from the central projection in the February Report in three main respects.  First, business investment rose strongly in the fourth quarter of 1998 and was revised up in earlier quarters.  Second, the degree of inventory build-up was rather lower, largely offsetting the impact of higher fixed investment on total domestic demand.  Third, net trade made a more negative contribution to GDP.  Imports were stronger than projected. The ratio of business investment to GDP rose further to a new record level.  The Committee considered two explanations for this apparent strength.  The first was that it might be linked to the Millennium, with companies bringing forward IT-related and construction spending.  Evidence from a recent survey of Bank Agents’ contacts provided some support for this view. The second explanation was that the desired level of  Prospects for inflation 47 business investment had been boosted, perhaps by higher IT-related spending which might have a shorter life-span than other components of the capital stock.  The Committee assigned some weight to both explanations, and having regard also to survey data on investment intentions, raised the projection for investment, particularly in 1999. The lower-than-expected level of inventories in the second half of 1998 has reduced the risks of a major stock correction in 1999.  Survey evidence suggests that manufacturers and retailers continued to shed stock in the early part of this year, but not sufficiently rapidly to lead to a dip in overall output.  The latest CBI survey for manufacturing suggests that stocks remain above desired levels, but that the extent of any overhang has been reduced.  However, the latest survey for distributive trades indicates that stocks were built up in April as demand failed to meet expectations.  Further falls in stocks seem likely in the coming months to eliminate the remaining excess.  This inventory reduction will detract from GDP growth.  Precautionary stockbuilding ahead of the Millennium may affect the timing from quarter to quarter.  The Committee judges that there is a risk that the aggregate stock-output ratio could fall less sharply than in the central projection, raising GDP and inflation. After the data revisions, the share of imports in domestic demand in 1998 was higher than estimated at the time of the February Report.  Bank Agents’ contacts report continued pressure from foreign competitors in both domestic and international markets, exacerbated by the further rise in sterling in recent months.  In assessing the overall prospects for net trade, the Committee judges that the dampening influences of stronger import penetration and the rise in sterling since February will outweigh the stimulatory effect of slightly stronger world trade growth.  The central projection is that net exports will depress GDP growth in both 1999 and 2000, and by more than expected three months ago. Although there were some modifications to the quarterly profile, consumer spending growth in the second half of 1998 was in line with expectations in the February Report.  Sales over the Christmas period were sluggish. More recently, there have been tentative signs of recovery.  The GfK consumer confidence indicator has returned to positive territory.  Housing market indicators, which provide another barometer of consumer sentiment, have turned up.  Personal lending figures are also rather stronger and mortgage approvals are up sharply, while  Inflation Report:  May 1999 48 the rise of over 10% in equity prices since the February Report has increased personal wealth.  These indicators provide support for the central projection that consumer spending growth will strengthen in the coming months in line with expectations at the time of the February Report. The Committee judges that the prospects for overall activity have changed relatively little from the February Report, although there are significant changes in some of the demand components.  Stronger investment and the impact of lower interest rates have raised the central projection for domestic demand growth.  But the additional stimulus to demand has been largely offset by a weaker outlook for net trade. The central projection is for the four-quarter growth rate of GDP at constant market prices to recover later this year from the current rate of between 1/2% and 1%, as domestic demand growth strengthens, and to return to assumed trend rates by the middle of next year (see Chart 6.1).(1) The four-quarter growth rate continues to rise thereafter, as the period of weaker growth drops out of the calculation, before levelling off by the end of the  two-year horizon. Recent survey evidence is consistent with the recovery in growth in the central projection, as business confidence indicators on a broad front have risen from the very weak levels of last autumn.  Indeed, the survey indicators are consistent with quarterly growth rates having passed their trough. Although recent outturns for activity were broadly in line with expectations, news on nominal variables over the past three months suggests that underlying inflationary pressures are weaker than previously thought.  The exchange rate has risen appreciably.  Broad money growth has continued to slow to a pace more consistent with the inflation target.  Surveys of inflation expectations have fallen further, which, other things being equal, should lead to lower growth in nominal wages and prices. The Average Earnings Index (AEI) was reinstated in early March, following the review commissioned by the Chancellor.  It will take time to implement all of the recommendations of the review and raise the quality of the index to the best statistical standards.  In the interim, the index remains an uncertain guide.

Prospects for inflation 49 suggests that nominal earnings growth fell more rapidly in the second half of 1998 than assumed at the time of the February Report, but from a higher peak in the spring.  However, the revised data for January and the preliminary estimate for February suggest that earnings growth may no longer be declining.  In contrast, wage settlements in the private sector appear to be lower than a year ago.  It is possible that earnings growth remains substantially higher than settlements because of bonuses and merit-based pay, although this is hard to assess given a statistical break in the information on irregular pay from February.  Increases in the pay of some workers to meet the requirements of the National Minimum Wage, outside the standard settlement, could also be a factor. Other indicators are mixed:  the Reward Index of earnings growth continued to slow in the first quarter, while the Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services survey reported an edging up of pay rates in April.  Implementation of the public sector pay review bodies’ recommendations will have added to earnings growth in the public sector from April.  But overall, the evidence from earnings and settlements, together with information from the Bank’s regional Agents, indicates a weakening in nominal pay pressures.  At the same time, the substantial reduction that has occurred in inflation expectations means that real earnings growth has fallen by less than nominal earnings growth and may on some measures have risen.  The Committee has lowered further the central projection for nominal earnings growth since the February Report. Over the past three months, employment has continued to rise, albeit at a slower pace than in the second half of last year.  Unemployment has edged up from near 20-year lows, partly as a greater number of previously inactive individuals have sought work.  The central projection continues to assume that employment growth will slow further, and indeed that employment may fall for a time while output growth is below trend. Productivity growth has an important influence on firms’ unit costs.  As noted in the February Report, measured productivity growth has been below trend for several years.  Moreover, productivity growth weakened further over the past year as employment continued to rise robustly when output growth was slowing.  Various explanations for the recent behaviour of productivity have been reviewed further.  In its central projection, the Committee has assumed that structural changes in the labour market have reduced the variability of productivity over the cycle.  While the reforms are  Inflation Report:  May 1999 50 beneficial, they may have temporarily reduced measured productivity growth in recent years.  Reforms may have encouraged firms to take on additional employees and to adjust hours worked more quickly than in the past, as well as leading to the creation of new jobs which may have lower than average levels of productivity.  Although a natural corollary would be that firms would also reduce labour more quickly in a cyclical downturn, the combination of a relatively tight labour market and perceptions that the slowdown was likely to be relatively moderate may have pushed in the opposite direction in recent months.  The Committee judges that productivity growth will return to its long-run historical average over the next two years, although the projected rise in measured productivity growth is somewhat less rapid than assumed in February. Empirical evidence suggests that firms tend to lower prices in relation to weighted costs when demand falls relative to supply capacity, although the effect may take time to feed through fully.  The central projection remains that companies will reduce price-cost margins further in response to the period of weak growth through late 1998 and 1999.  The Committee judges the effects of a change in demand on pricing behaviour to be similar on average over the cycle to the assumptions embodied in the February Report, but the central projection incorporates the view that a more flexible labour market has reduced the extent to which production is below its desired level, and hence the degree of downward pressure on margins.  The Committee recognises that the cyclical behaviour of productivity and price-cost margins is an area of considerable uncertainty. The Committee’s projection for the twelve-month RPIX inflation rate—based on the assumption that nominal interest rates are held constant at 5.25%—is shown in Chart 6.2.(1) It is presented alongside the projection from the February Report, which was based on constant interest rates at 5.5%. There are some differences between the current inflation profile and that shown in February.  The starting-point is slightly higher than in February, although this is entirely owing to the temporary effects on duties from the timing of the Budget.  As this effect drops out in the second quarter, RPIX inflation is a little weaker than in the earlier projection:  the combination of lower non-oil commodity prices, a higher exchange rate and slower earnings growth more than offset the impact of higher oil (1) Also shown as Chart 2 in the Overview.  Prospects for inflation 51 prices.  Inflation may fall below target for a time.  As the temporary effect of the higher exchange rate on imported inflation fades, lower interest rates and slightly stronger prospective output growth than in February underpin the rise in inflation to the target level in early 2001. Risks to activity are relatively evenly balanced throughout the forecast period, as the Committee judges that global prospects are no longer weighted to the downside around the central projection.  A possible fall in equity prices is a downside risk for activity;  the possibilities that sterling could be weaker and that stockbuilding could be stronger are counterbalancing upside risks.  The risks to inflation are slightly on the upside in both years:  the possibility that the exchange rate falls more than implied by interest rate differentials is the main factor.  However, some Committee members see greater downside risks to inflation from a stronger exchange rate profile, weaker world activity and prices, and greater pressure on margins, than assumed in the central projection.  Charts 6.4 and 6.5 show the overall balance of risks to inflation at the two-year horizon. Table 6.A presents the MPC’s judgment of the probabilities of various outcomes for inflation and GDP growth.

Inflation Report:  May 1999 52 The market expectation of the likely path of interest rates has risen slightly since the February Report.  On  5 May, implied interest rates on short-sterling futures contracts suggested that the market expectation was, on balance, for official rates to remain close to current levels or a little below in the near term.  There were some expectations of a small rise in rates in 2000.  So the MPC’s projections for inflation and output growth under the assumption that official rates follow market expectations are almost identical to the constant rate projection (see Charts 6.6 and 6.7).

Prospects for inflation 53 6.3 Other forecasts Chart 6.8 shows the distribution of central forecasts for the twelve-month rate of RPIX inflation in 2001 Q2, based on information gathered from 26 forecasters surveyed by the Bank in late April.  The mean forecast for the year to 1999 Q4 was 2.2%, rising to 2.3% in 2000 Q4, and reaching 2.4% in 2001 Q2.  The estimates for 1999 and 2000 are slightly higher than the projections made at the time of the January survey.  The forecasters assign a 45% probability to inflation being above the target in the second quarter of 2001, and a 55% probability to it being below (see Table 6.B). These estimates have changed slightly since the February Report, with more weight being placed on higher outturns for inflation. The forecasters’ average projection for GDP growth in the year to 1999 Q4 is 11/4% (with a range of projections from 1/4% to 21/4%), rising to 3% in the year to 2001 Q2 (with a range of 2% to 33/4%).  The mean projections are both half a percentage point higher than in January.  The forecasters on average assign a 9% probability to output growth falling below zero in the year to 1999 Q4, compared with 20% at the time of the January survey. The implications of the latest projections for the stance of monetary policy are discussed in the Overview at the beginning of the Report.

The international environment:  activity 2 The Committee’s interest rate reductions over the past few months had been heavily influenced by a weakening international environment.  In preparing its February Inflation Report, it had assessed the cumulative news since its November projections. 3 The strength of the US economy continued to surprise.  The official estimate of GDP growth in 1998 Q4 was significantly higher than the Committee had been expecting.  The longer such strong growth persisted, the greater the risk that the economy would encounter capacity constraints and rising inflationary pressures, but so far US inflation had remained low.  There was also a risk of a negative shock to demand.  The strength in the US stock market, and therefore household wealth, was obviously contributing to buoyant consumption, encouraging low private sector savings out of income.  The outlook was vulnerable to the possibility of a sharp equity market correction.  It was also possible that the increasing trade deficit associated with such strong demand growth would intensify trade policy tensions, although it had to be recognised that the US economy was operating at or above capacity overall.  Any possible trade tensions might be ameliorated by the recent appreciation of the yen, although that potentially exacerbated the weakness of aggregate demand in Japan.  While continuing robust US demand growth was possible in the short run and was helping to sustain global activity, the balance of risks in the medium term was on the downside. 4 The prospects for the global economy would be better if there were a more positive outlook for demand growth in the euro area.  While consumer confidence indicators were quite strong, measures of industrial sentiment were weak.  It was not clear whether this reflected recent weakness in activity growth, or whether it was a leading indicator of further output weakness. Possible explanations for the fall in business confidence in continental Europe included the cumulative effects of the emerging market economy crises on export markets and import competition; and uncertainty about economic policies.  There seemed to be divergent views in the euro area on the importance of supply-side policies, including structural reform of labour markets;  and on the desirable mix of fiscal and monetary policy.  A related area of uncertainty was the prospective policy response of the European Central Bank (ECB) if the outlook for demand remained sluggish. Some commentators had speculated that as long as inflation (as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices) was in the range 0%–2%, the ECB’s definition of price stability, ECB interest rate policy would be in a ‘zone of inaction’;  ie that the ECB might not respond to expected changes in inflation so long as it was set to remain in that range.  Uncertainty about ECB policy at this early point was probably inevitable.  It was also noted that the outlook in some of the smaller EMU countries was more buoyant than in Germany, France and Italy;  and that the ECB’s figures for the three-month centred average of the annual rate of growth of euro area broad money remained slightly above its 4.5% reference rate. 5 Japan remained a concern, with the recession likely to last longer than thought earlier and with the balance of risks in the short run on the downside.  There were some positive signs that policymakers would tackle the structural problems in the financial sector.  If embarked upon with determination, this would not only be beneficial in itself but might also give a positive signal about policy more generally, and so help to restore confidence.  In addition, a consequence of the long recession was that corporate balance sheets were also generally weak, so that financial sector reform—while necessary and important—might well not be sufficient to restore growth. 6 In the emerging market economies, the main event since the Committee’s January meeting had been the floating of the Brazilian real, and the questions which that had raised about Brazil’s monetary policy and about fiscal sustainability given the structure of its domestic and external debt.  So far direct spillover effects seemed to have been small, perhaps because the float had been discounted by markets.  The spread of the yield on emerging market US $ bonds over US Treasury Bond yields had, however, risen back towards the highs seen shortly after Russia’s default in  mid-1998.  The situation remained fragile. 7 Taking these developments together, the Committee agreed that the recent news about the international environment underlined its concerns about the world economic outlook, rather than substantially shifted its view compared with a month ago.  In particular, the Committee remained concerned about the current and prospective imbalances in the global economy.  Given reduced net capital flows to many emerging market economies, the industrialised world probably needed to stimulate domestic demand, to help offset weaker net trade, if world demand growth was to be sustained.  So far, with domestic demand very weak in Japan and sluggish in the euro area, the United States had effectively been acting as ‘consumer of last resort’.  But it was uncertain how long that could last, given the already prolonged period of above-trend growth in the United States.  While the balance of risks to activity in Japan was on the downside in the short run but possibly on the upside in the medium run, it was probably the other way round in the United States.  The industrialised world therefore faced a formidable challenge in balancing current and prospective aggregate world demand with potential supply.  It would be difficult to manage the scale and timing of any adjustments to domestic demand;  and industrial countries would need to accept larger current account deficits (or smaller surpluses) while domestic demand was stimulated.  The process might in principle be helped by exchange-rate adjustments amongst the major floating currencies, but this was highly uncertain in practice. The international environment:  prices 8 Against this background, the Committee debated the proposition that the world economy could conceivably be on a path to generalised price deflation.  The prices of a range of internationally traded goods and services had been falling. Evidence from further along the price chain could be seen in UK manufacturing input and output prices:  following a fall of nearly 9% in the twelve months to December, input prices were down to the level prevailing in 1986, and output price growth (which reflected labour costs as well as input prices) had been flat for the first time since 1960.  The risk of domestic inflation expectations falling sharply could, on this view, be exacerbated by the coincidence of weak world prices with the prospect of the RPI falling to historically low levels on account of the recent reductions in mortgage interest rates.   9 A number of arguments were made against the prospect of global price deflation.  First, the prices of some higher-value-added internationally traded goods and services were still rising.  Second, Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 3–4 February 1999  Inflation Report:  May 1999 58 the path of sterling input prices over the past couple of years had been affected by sterling’s large appreciation from August 1996. Third, many G7 central banks were pursuing de facto inflation targets (ie annual increases in average prices) of around 2%;  for example, the UK’s target was 21/2% and the ECB defined price stability as 0%–2%.  Achieving sustained low inflation was consistent with—indeed probably required—falls in the nominal price of some goods and services while those of others rose, reflecting for example different rates of productivity growth in different sectors, and/or shifting patterns of relative demand.  Not all firms could rely on rises in the nominal price of their products and some might have to accept that their prices would normally be falling;  but, given the UK’s poor inflationary record over the  past 25 years or so, it might take time for this to be reflected in firms’ behaviour.  Fourth, money growth in the United States  and in Europe remained reasonably strong.  In the medium to  long run central banks should be able to determine the average  rate of inflation, and the average rate of money growth was a reasonable broad indicator of the trend rate of increase of nominal variables. 10 Overall, the Committee agreed that in the short term there were downside risks to UK domestic prices from weaker than expected world prices.  Judgments on the extent of this risk varied. Monetary conditions 11 Sterling’s effective exchange rate had not changed much over the past month.  The Committee noted that its recent interest rate reductions had not been accompanied by a fall in sterling. 12 Inflation expectations, as measured by surveys, had fallen further over the past month.  It was suggested that they might now be better anchored around the 21/2% target. 13 The recent trend in the broad money numbers had been more comforting than during much of 1998.  Annual growth in December was 8.1%, and the three and six-month growth rates slightly lower.  M4 lending growth had also eased back.  Much of the recent fall had been accounted for by the Other Financial Companies sector, and it was too early to tell whether this simply reflected a larger-than-usual seasonal shrinking of balance sheets around the year-end.  Household broad money growth, at around 61/2%, was higher in December than during most of 1998. 14 Unsecured consumer credit taken out by the household sector had continued to grow strongly.  However, it appeared possible that over the past few years this had mirrored lower borrowing via mortgage equity withdrawal, which had been negative since the early 1990s.  Work by Bank staff suggested that there had not been a marked change in the relationship between consumption and total borrowing for consumption (as measured by unsecured borrowing plus mortgage equity withdrawal). 15 Overall, the Committee judged that, since its November projections were finalised, the upside risks to inflation from cumulatively strong money growth had eased;  and that there was a smaller risk of sterling depreciating by more than implied by interest rate differentials. Domestic demand:  household balance sheets and consumption 16 The Committee noted that the preliminary estimate of 0.2% GDP growth in 1998 Q4 was consistent with the degree of slowdown expected in its November central projection.  Some members had feared lower growth, and the possibility of revisions remained.  Surveys suggested that consumer and business sentiment had stopped deteriorating and had perhaps improved slightly, possibly helped by the 150 basis point reduction in official interest rates since October.  The preliminary data on Q4 expenditure suggested, however, that household spending might have grown by less in relation to income and wealth than the Committee had assumed in November. 17 In this context, the Committee discussed the household sector balance sheet.  The ratio of debt-to-net worth was lower than in recent cycles, but this was in part attributable to high equity prices, and so was potentially vulnerable to a fall in the stock market, which among other things might be triggered by a fall in the US market.  The ratio of debt service charges-to-household income was also low by recent standards, although this largely reflected low nominal interest rates.  On the other hand, the  debt-to-income ratio was quite high.  Overall the Committee did not regard this as a material concern:  the personal sector had increased its debt following the financial liberalisations of the 1980s, so that earlier periods were not a good guide.  On this view, the state of household balance sheets was unlikely to provide an explanation for the weaker-than-expected consumption. 18 The Committee noted that some savers had been adversely affected by the fall in interest rates.  Some commentators had argued that this would reduce aggregate demand.  A number of observations were made about this.  The fall in medium-long run nominal interest rates—for example conventional gilt yields— largely reflected quite a large fall in expected inflation.  The earlier higher nominal yields had been compensating for the erosion, via inflation, of the real value of their wealth, so that households may in the past have been consuming part of the real capital value of their investment.  They could continue to do so in a low inflation environment, but this would mean realising part of their investment rather than spending from high nominal income receipts.  It was possible that not all savers understood this, in which case lower nominal rates on savings products might have had a small dampening affect on consumption.  But it was unclear why this inflation illusion should influence savers more than borrowers. 19 Against this background and its earlier discussions on this broad issue (reported in the minutes of its December meeting), the Committee noted that it had decided, in preparing its latest projections, to make some allowance for the possibility that consumption growth over the forecast period might not offset the weaker-than-expected outturns of the past few quarters. Conditions in labour and product markets 20 The outlook for conditions in the labour market was very uncertain.  In particular, the recent rate of earnings growth was unusually uncertain, given the continued absence of the Average Earnings Index;  and it was unclear why measured productivity growth had recently been below trend. 21 As regards earnings growth, the Committee considered the outlook for pay settlements and for wage drift (the difference between earnings growth and settlements).  Settlements had been fairly stable since the middle of 1998;  and an informal survey undertaken by the Bank’s regional Agents had recorded that more firms expected settlements in 1999 to be below the 1998 level than expected them to be above:  wage drift also seemed likely to moderate.  Average hours worked had in fact already fallen, so there had probably been a fall in overtime payments.  The Reward Index was suggesting that earnings growth had been slowing.  The Working Time Directive and the National Minimum Wage were, by contrast, likely to put upward pressure on labour costs.  The Committee noted that lower growth in nominal earnings than previously expected would be consistent with the fall in  survey-based measures of inflation expectations.  The Committee also received an oral progress report on the independent review, commissioned by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, of the official Average Earnings Index.  No figures were yet available for the Committee, but the indications were that the review would not be inconsistent at least with the starting point for the path of nominal earnings growth assumed by the Committee.  Monetary Policy Committee 59 22 Some members of the Committee were concerned about  the potential knock-on effects from the recently announced settlements for public sector workers.  Other members thought  that, with a reasonably integrated labour market, the public sector could be expected to settle close to the economy-wide average over time. 23 The Committee agreed to incorporate a materially lower profile for nominal earnings growth in its February projection compared with November, although its central projection was still above the average of outside forecasts. 24 There was considerable uncertainty about recent and prospective growth in productivity, and so in unit labour costs. Employment having risen strongly over the past few years, productivity growth had, at around 11/2% annually, been significantly below trend.  The various possible explanations had quite different implications for the outlook for inflation.  One possibility was simply mismeasurement.  A second was that firms thought the slowdown in activity growth would not last long so that, given the costs of adjusting the size of their labour forces, they were content to employ more people than needed for current activity levels;  ie they were hoarding labour.  That would mean current levels of employment exaggerated the degree of capacity utilisation at present.  Correcting for this would imply lower margins and inflationary pressures. 25 A third possibility was that as unemployment had fallen so had productivity growth, through people entering the workforce into lower productivity jobs, with lower pay, following the various structural reforms to the labour market.  In that case, productivity would be expected to grow in the future at its past trend rate but starting from a lower average level.  Productive capacity, at any particular level of employment, would in that case be lower than implied by previous relationships.  This would have less benign implications for inflation than the labour hoarding explanation. 26 The Committee agreed to give some weight to each of these possible explanations in its central projection.  However, some members did not attach weight to the third possible explanation, pointing to recent robust growth in labour productivity in the United States despite very low unemployment there;  excluding it would reduce the central projection for inflation by around  0.2 percentage points. The MPC’s February projections 27 The Committee reviewed its projections, which were described more fully in the Inflation Report published in the week following the meeting. 28 Output growth was expected to fall during 1999 but to recover during 2000, partly reflecting planned increases in public sector spending.  As in November, the balance of risks to activity was on the downside over the whole of the forecast period.  The shape of the central projection for inflation was broadly flat over most of the forecast period, rising slightly towards the two year horizon.  The balance of risks to inflation was slightly on the upside until the middle of the year 2000 and then slightly on the downside. Uncertainty about the projections (ie the variance) had been adjusted to reflect the continuing suspension of the Average Earnings Index. 29 For any given level of interest rates, the level of the projections for both output growth and inflation was lower than in November.  The main changes to the output projection were lower consumption and the weaker outlook for world demand and UK exports.  The inflation projection was also affected by the lower path assumed for nominal earnings growth.  If interest rates were left at 6%, both the central projection for inflation and the average projection (taking account of the balance of risks)—ie both the mode and the mean—were materially below the 21/2% inflation target.  The projections therefore pointed towards a further reduction in interest rates. 30 The Committee discussed the predictions of a sample of outside forecasters.  The median forecast for inflation was around 21/2% in 2001 Q1.  It was possible that this simply reflected a belief that the Committee would pursue a policy that would succeed in achieving the 21/2% target at that horizon.  The assumptions of outside forecasters about interest rates were also likely to differ from the constant rate assumption used in the Bank’s own projections. 31 The Committee noted that the level of short term interest rates implied by financial markets fell to around 5% by the end of 1999.  Using market interest rates in the Bank’s projections implied that both the central projection for inflation and the average projection (taking account of the risks) would be above the 21/2% target from the middle of 1999, and materially so by the end of the two year forecast horizon. The immediate policy decision 32 The Committee discussed whether its latest projections for GDP growth and inflation had implications for the timing of any policy changes.  In particular, should any further reductions in interest rates be made quickly given that the most significant weakness in activity was expected over the next six months? Would cuts now endanger the inflation outlook over the medium run given that towards the end of the forecast period output growth was expected to reach trend and inflation to be rising?  The Committee agreed that various time paths for interest rates would be consistent with achieving the inflation target.  Its central projection was for the annual rate of output growth to be below trend for the next six quarters, so that an immediate easing of policy could stimulate activity and reduce downward pressures on inflation in the short run without causing an overshoot of the target over the medium run.  Policy might then have to be tightened at some point in the coming two years if output growth recovered as expected, but that could not yet be judged, and it did not need to be. 33 Against that background, there was agreement that interest rates needed to be reduced again.  A 25 basis point reduction, taking the Bank’s repo rate to 5.75% would leave the central projection below target throughout the second year of the forecast period.  A 50 basis point reduction, to 5.5%, would bring the central projection broadly into line with the target throughout the forecast period.  At the two year horizon, the central projection would be just a little above the target;  the average projection (taking account of the balance of risks) would still be slightly below target.  It was noted that some of the risks reflected in the forecast were of a kind to which the Committee could respond if and when they materialised.  Setting aside risks of this kind, the average rate of inflation at the end of forecast horizon with constant 5.5% official interest rates was also close to the target.  These considerations pointed towards a 50 basis point reduction. 34 A second argument made in favour of 50 basis points was that it would provide a degree of insurance against some of the downside risks.  In particular, the international outlook looked slightly more fragile than a month ago, and there was a risk of labour market pressures proving materially weaker than assumed in the Committee’s projections. 35 A third argument for 50 basis points was that any consequential fall in sterling would be helpful in alleviating the continuing imbalances in the economy, without endangering achievement of the inflation target. 36 One view was that at this point of the economic cycle interest rates should be close to, or possibly below, their ‘neutral’ level;  ie, providing neither stimulus nor constraint to the economy. While that level could not be stimulated with great accuracy, a  Inflation Report:  May 1999 60 reduction of 50 basis points, on this view, would take the nominal short term rate into its probable neutral range.  Three reasons were given why, on this view, a reduction of more than 50 basis points might be needed.  First, it might already be too late to stop RPIX inflation falling materially below target over the next year.  In that case, a larger cut would help to anchor inflation expectations closer to the target over the medium run.  Second, it was plausible, judging from the reports of the Bank’s regional Agents and from surveys, that earnings growth would be lower in 1999 than in 1998, contrary to the assumption used in the Committee’s central projection.  Third, the Committee’s inflation projection did not place enough weight on the possibility of world price inflation being weaker than assumed.  However, evidence on each of these uncertainties would materialise over the next few months, and a larger than 50 basis point reduction now might unsettle financial markets.  On this view, therefore, a cut of 50 basis points was the right step for now. 37 On another view, there were arguments for a reduction of 75–100 basis points.  First, the central projection for inflation was around 0.2 percentage points too high because the level of productivity would be higher than assumed for the reasons explained in paragraph 26.  The average (ie mean) projection for inflation, should also be lower both for that reason and also because of the possibility of weaker world prices.  Second, given that monetary policy was expected generally to affect activity growth with a shorter lag than it affected inflation, it would be possible to ease policy by more than 50 basis points now with a view to supporting activity in the relatively near term without endangering achievement of the inflation target.  On this view, these two factors together made a reduction in the range 75–100 basis points desirable. 38 The Governor invited members of the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate be cut by 0.50% to 5.5%. Eight members of the Committee (the Governor, Mervyn King, David Clementi, Alan Budd, Charles Goodhart, DeAnne Julius, Ian Plenderleith and John Vickers) voted for the proposition.  Willem Buiter voted against, preferring a cut of 0.75%. 39 The following members of the Committee were present: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Alan Budd Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers 40 Andrew Turnbull was present as the Treasury representative.  Monetary Policy Committee 61 1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by the Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee on 29 January 1999, in advance of its meeting on 3–4 February 1999.  At the start of the Committee meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and that information is included in the Annex. I Monetary conditions 2 Notes and coin had risen by 0.6% in January and the annualised three and six-month growth rates had picked up to 7.1% and 6.1% respectively, after adjusting for the effects of the introduction of the 50p and £2 coins.  However, new estimates of seasonal factors had led to the December monthly growth rate being revised down from 1.2% to 0.6%.  In the past, there had been some correlation between monthly changes in notes and coin and current and future changes in the value of retail sales. 3 The twelve-month growth rate of M4 had been 8.1% in December, the lowest since June 1995.  Annualised three and  six-month growth rates had been below the twelve-month rate.  The slowdown had been driven by other financial corporations (OFCs): the twelve-month growth rate of OFCs’ M4 in 1998 Q4 had been 16.0%, the lowest since 1995 Q2.  This figure could have reflected a temporary contraction of OFCs’ balance sheets at the end of the financial year.   4 Households’ M4 growth had continued to pick up in  1998 Q4.  The three-month annualised growth rate in the quarter had been 9.0%, the highest since 1997 Q1, and the six-month annualised rate of 8.1% had been the highest since 1997 Q2. 5 The £0.2 billion fall in private non-financial corporations’ (PNFCs’) deposits during 1998 Q4 had been the first fall since  1995 Q2.  The twelve-month growth rate had fallen to 3.5% in Q4 from 5.2% in Q3.  Firms may have been using bank deposits as a form of ‘buffer stock’ to smooth fluctuations in cashflows as they adjusted to changes in demand. 6 M4 lending had also continued to slow in December.  The twelve-month rate, at 7.5%, had been the lowest since April 1995, while the three and six-month annualised growth rates had remained below the twelve-month growth rate.  As with M4, the slowdown had been led by OFCs.  The twelve-month growth rate of OFCs lending had fallen to 9.7% in 1998 Q4, down by  6.0 percentage points from 1998 Q3, and the lowest level since 1994 Q3.  As with their M4 deposits, contraction of financial institutions’ balance sheets at the year end had contributed to weak OFCs’ lending in Q4. 7 M4 lending to the household sector had remained firm in 1998 Q4, growing by 7.5% on a year earlier.  Within the comprehensive measure of lending to individuals, the growth of secured lending had been steady at 5.9%, despite a slowdown in the housing market.  Growth in unsecured lending had remained high in Q4, at 16.3%. 8 The recent strength of unsecured lending contrasted with the relative weakness of consumption.  One interpretation was that this was a shift from other forms of borrowing such as mortgage equity withdrawal.  Wider measures of consumer borrowing, which included equity withdrawal, had continued to show a closer relationship with consumption in recent quarters. 9 The twelve-month growth rate of M4 lending to PNFCs had picked up in 1998 Q4 (by 0.5 percentage points, to 6.4%), although the three and six-month growth rates had remained below the twelve-month rate.  Total external borrowing by PNFCs in Q4 had fallen slightly, by £0.3 billion to £7.3 billion, mainly reflecting lower net capital issues in foreign currency. 10 Banks and building societies had announced further cuts to standard variable mortgage rates following the reduction in official rates in January.  Mortgage rates had been reduced by the full  150 basis point cut in the repo rate since October.  Credit card rates had fallen again in December, especially among long-established lenders.  This was indicative of competition from new entrants in the market. 11 Inflation expectations for 1999 as measured by surveys of professional forecasters, conducted by Consensus Economics (forecasts of average 1999 RPIX inflation), HM Treasury (forecasts of 1999 Q4 RPIX inflation) and the Merrill Lynch survey of fund managers (forecasts of RPIX inflation in the year to December 1999) had remained largely unchanged in January, and were between 20 and 40 basis points below the Bank’s inflation target. Inflation expectations for 2000, measured by the same institutions and on the same basis, had all been 2.2%.  The Merrill Lynch survey had been conducted prior to the cut in the repo rate on  6 January. 12 Estimates of short real rates had been made by subtracting the Merrill Lynch survey measure of inflation expectations from the corresponding-maturity wholesale money-market rate.  This calculation had suggested that the one-year real forward rate for 2000 had fallen during December, by around 20 basis points.  II Demand and output 13 GDP had risen by 0.2% in 1998 Q4 and by 1.6% compared with a year ago.  Service sector output had grown by 0.6%, compared with 0.8% in Q3.  December manufacturing output data had not yet been published, but in the three months to November, output had fallen by 1.1%.  Car production had fallen by almost 4% in 1998 H2 compared with 1998 H1:  production for export markets had risen by 7%, whereas production for home markets had declined by 17%.  But there had been anecdotal reports that export orders for cars were falling.  Within services, distribution, hotels and catering output had been flat in Q4. 14 Retail sales volumes had fallen sharply in December, by 0.9%, more than reversing November’s rise.  In Q4 overall, sales volumes had fallen by 0.2%, the first quarterly fall since 1992 Q3. The annual growth rate had stood at 1.4% in Q4.  The underlying trend in retail sales growth had still been downward. 15 Quarterly growth in retail sales and National Accounts data for spending on retail goods had not always been consistent.  For example, there were different surveys for food.  And car registrations data had implied a rise in spending on cars in Q4.   It was possible that, overall, consumption growth in Q4 had not been as weak as the retail sales data suggested. 16 Surveys for plant and machinery investment had continued to indicate a slowdown in investment growth.  The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) Industrial Trends and British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) surveys for Q4 had indicated that, on balance, manufacturers had intended to reduce investment, though there had been some easing in the CBI survey balance (from -32 to -21).  The BCC survey balance for the service sector had continued to show positive investment intentions, though the balance had fallen from +27 in Q2 to +17 in Q4.  Around 50% of whole-economy investment tended to be accounted for by investment in buildings. And construction new orders had been rising during 1998. Annex:  Summary of data presented by Bank staff  Inflation Report:  May 1999 62 17 The CBI survey had suggested that although manufacturers had sharply reduced their stocks of finished goods in Q4—the balance had fallen to -14 from +3—stocks had remained high relative to expected demand.  An unwinding of stocks had been consistent with falling manufacturing output in Q4.  The CBI Distributive Trades survey had also indicated that retail stocks had remained excessive relative to demand in December. 18 The total goods trade deficit had widened in November, mainly because of a deterioration in the non-EU balance.  The total deficit in the three months to November had been £6.3 billion, the highest since October 1989.  In December, the non-EU goods deficit had narrowed slightly.  For 1998 as a whole, the non-EU goods deficit had been a record £15.7 billion;  the value of exports to South East Asia had fallen by 27%, and the value of imports from that region had risen by 3%.  Total goods export volumes (excluding oil and erratics) had been falling—by 2.2% in the three months to November—whereas import volumes had risen by 2.7%. The fall in exports had been largely explained by cars and other consumer goods.  The CBI export orders balances had recovered a little in Q4, but still pointed to falling export volumes. 19 The Halifax house price index had risen by 0.5% in January, after having fallen by 0.1% in December, taking the annual inflation rate to 4.4% from 4.5%.  The Nationwide index had risen by 1.4% in January, with annual inflation up to 7.4% from 7.0% in December.  Activity as measured by particulars delivered had been 8% down in the three months to December on the previous three months, and leading indicators of housing market transactions had pointed to flat or falling transactions in the coming months.  New house-building activity had also remained weak, though the House Builders’ Federation survey reported that nearly two thirds of builders planned to increase starts in 1999.  20 GfK consumer confidence had risen in January.  But the survey balance was not seasonally adjusted, and tended to rise in January.  It had remained negative (-2.2) and below its level a year earlier.  The divergence between consumers’ perceptions about the general economic situation and their own financial situation, which had emerged in mid 1998, had remained evident.  Consumers had still expected the general economic situation to deteriorate, but had expected their own situation to improve. 21 Companies had appeared to be in a stronger financial situation than they were in the late 1980s-early 1990s.  An examination of the distribution of gearing across quoted companies had suggested that most of these companies should have been able to service their debt with relative ease.  And the market valuation of the corporate sector had suggested that future profits would also be high relative to the interest costs of servicing debt.  But income gearing had been rising, and (possibly associated with that) the rate of insolvencies had begun to increase. 22 The deterioration in manufacturing survey balances for orders and expected orders had eased:  the CBI export optimism balance had risen to -18, from -41 in 1998 Q3 and a low of -50 in Q2.  But they had still pointed to a decline in manufacturing output in 1999 Q1.  Supporting this, the Chartered Institute of Purchasing Supply (CIPS) manufacturing output index for January was 42.3: below the 50 ‘no change’ level.  The BCC home orders balance for the service sector had declined further in 1998 Q4, from +11 to +5, suggesting a further slowdown in service sector output growth in 1999 Q1.  But the BCC survey had also indicated that the balance of firms in the manufacturing and service sector that had been operating at or above full capacity in 1998 Q4 had been relatively high. III International environment 23 In the United States, GDP had risen by 1.4% in Q4. Consumers’ confidence about current conditions had risen in January, but expectations of future conditions had continued to fall. Non-farm payrolls had risen sharply in December, keeping employment growth at 2.3% on a year earlier.  However, there continued to be sharp sectoral differences:  employment had been falling from month to month in manufacturing for most of 1998, while growth in the rest of economy was still robust.  Capacity utilisation had fallen slightly in November.  Survey measures of slack had also pointed downwards.  24 The trade deficit had widened to $15.5 billion in November, but the trend over recent months had been unclear.  The overall consumer price index had increased 1.6% on a year ago in December.  The difference in goods and service price inflation had persisted.  This had partly reflected differences in labour cost inflation.  The Employment Cost Index for services had risen more sharply than for manufacturing in 1998. 25 In Europe, recent production data had been stronger and consumption data had been weaker, somewhat against the recent trend.  French industrial production had risen by 1.0% in November and by 0.7% in October.  Italian industrial production had shown a stronger trend, but November production had fallen by 1.5% on a month ago.  German industrial production had fallen by 2.2% in November, and manufacturing orders had pointed to a further sharp slowdown in the coming months.  German GDP in the fourth quarter had probably fallen.  French household consumption had fallen in December for the third consecutive month.  Industrial confidence in the euro area had fallen to -9 in December, from -8 in November and +1 in December 1997.  Consumer confidence had risen in December in most countries, although not in Spain or Germany.  Euro-area HICP fell to 0.8% in December.  26 In Japan, the Economic Planning Agency had expected positive GDP growth in the fourth quarter, resulting from increases in private consumption, public investment and net trade.  But despite discounting by retailers, Japanese retail sales had remained weak in December.  Employment had continued to fall in manufacturing and the construction sectors, though public works spending had slowed the fall in construction.  Central government new construction orders had increased from September onwards, but they had been more than offset by the contraction in local government new orders.  Industrial production had risen strongly in December.  But for 1998 as a whole, industrial production had fallen by 6.9%, the largest fall since 1975.  Inventory levels and the inventory/shipments ratio had both fallen in December.  Overall, there had been little evidence of a recovery in private sector activity.  Bank lending had continued to decline at record rates, the outlook for consumption had remained weak, and public works spending had remained ineffective. 27 The Consensus Economics mean forecast for Japanese GDP growth had fallen by 0.5 percentage points to -1.1% for 1999;  for US GDP growth, it had been revised up, from 2.3% in December to 2.4% in January;  and for GDP growth in Germany in 1999, it had fallen from 2.0% to 1.8%. Emerging markets 28 The devaluation and subsequent float of the Brazilian real had resulted in a 32% depreciation against the US dollar between 12 January and 3 February.  Short-term interest rates had been increased by just over 9% since the devaluation, to 39%. 29 The more pessimistic scenarios that had been discussed in the market assumed financial contagion from Brazil to a much wider range of countries.  There had been evidence of pressure on fixed exchange rates in, for example, Argentina and Hong Kong, but not as yet a wider impact such as that which had followed the Russian default.  The pre-EU accession countries in central Europe had been in a position to borrow externally and to ease monetary policy.  The Asian crisis countries (except Indonesia) had had some, albeit limited, access to external funds, in some cases with the guarantee of Japan or the World Bank.  Nevertheless, the  Monetary Policy Committee 63 external financing prospects of emerging countries in aggregate had continued to deteriorate.  IV The labour market 30 LFS employment had grown by 98,000 (0.4%) in the three months to November, compared with the previous three months, consistent with the Workforce jobs growth figure, released in the previous month, of a rise of 97,000 in the three months to September.  The increase in LFS employment had been largely accounted for by a large rise in employees, but self-employment had also risen, ending the steep decline earlier in the year.  The total number of hours worked had risen more slowly than employment (by 0.1% in the three months to November), implying a fall in the number of hours worked per person, consistent with the increase in LFS employment over this period being concentrated in part-time jobs.  Hours worked per person were 0.8% lower than a year earlier.     31 Strong increases in employment had contrasted with survey evidence.  The CIPS manufacturing and construction surveys for January had suggested that employment was continuing to fall.  The CIPS services survey for January had suggested that employment was now falling in services too.  Forward-looking surveys had suggested that this pattern might persist.  The BCC services survey for Q4 had shown that employment intentions were broadly unchanged, while the manufacturing balance had become more negative.  The CBI manufacturing survey balance had also become more negative, to its lowest level since 1992 Q3.  The Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services survey had also suggested that the demand for employees was falling. 32 The number of new notifications at job centres had fallen by 3,500 in December, while the stock of vacancies had fallen by 3,900.  The National Press Recruitment Advertising index had stabilised in recent months.  The BCC survey for Q4 had suggested that recruitment difficulties in manufacturing and services had eased slightly.  But the CBI Industrial Trends survey for Q4 showed a small rise in expected skill shortages in manufacturing in the next few months.  33 Both of the main measures of unemployment had fallen on the latest data.  LFS unemployment had decreased by 26,000 in the three months to November.  The LFS unemployment rate had been unchanged from the three months to October, at 6.2%.   Claimant-count unemployment had fallen by 14,000 in December to its lowest level since June 1980, though the rate had also remained unchanged, at 4.6%.  There had been little sign of increased redundancies in the claimant-count inflow numbers, while the exit rate from unemployment had remained high. 34 Labour market inactivity had not seemed to be following a normal cyclical pattern.  It had been increasing in the first half of 1998, but had reversed since June.  According to the LFS, inactivity had fallen by a further 33,000 in the three months to November. The fall in inactivity in this period had been smaller than in recent months and, in an accounting sense, this had explained why the latest employment increase had—unlike those of recent months— been accompanied by a fall in unemployment. 35 There had been no new official earnings data:  the Average Earnings Index was still suspended.  The Reward index of  earnings growth had slowed further to 4.8% in December from 5.4% in June. 36 The twelve-month employment-weighted average settlements measure had remained flat in December, at 3.7%.  But most settlements tended to be concentrated between January and April.  Private and public sector settlements remained unchanged, at 4.0% and 3.3% respectively.  The three-month  employment-weighted mean increased from 3.8% in November to 4.1% in December, while the median fell from 3.8% to 3.7%. 37 Details of the settlements for public sector workers covered by the Pay Review Bodies had been announced on 1 February. Overall, the paybill of workers covered by the Review Bodies was to increase by 4.1% and the settlements would not be staged. 38 The Bank’s regional Agents had conducted an informal survey of contacts on the prospects for earnings growth in 1999.  Of the firms sampled that had a company-wide settlement, 46% had expected it to be lower in percentage terms in 1999 than in 1998. Only 13% of firms had expected their settlement to rise.  But 29% of firms had expected growth in total earnings per employee to be higher in 1999, with 38% expecting it to be lower. 39 The inflation outlook and company prospects, particularly in the manufacturing sector, were highlighted by these respondents as factors likely to depress earnings growth in 1999.  A majority had cited recruitment difficulties as an upward pressure on earnings growth.  Other widely quoted upward pressures had included productivity growth and bonuses, the latter reflecting increased use of performance-related pay across firms.  Some respondents had also mentioned the National Minimum Wage, the Working Time Directive and the phased end of Profit-Related Pay (PRP) tax benefits. V Prices 40 On the basis of provisional data, in the Bank’s index of commodity prices excluding oil had shown a small rise in December.  The annual rate of inflation had risen slightly to -6.2% from -6.3%, and the underlying growth rate (three months on a year earlier) had risen to -5.3%, the highest rate since August 1997. That had been driven by recent growth in UK agriculture prices and a slowdown in metals price deflation.  Nonetheless, market commentators had forecast a slight fall in commodity prices in 1999, before a pick-up in 2000.  Commodity prices including oil had continued to fall, by 2.5% in December, according to the Bank’s index. 41 Oil prices had risen to more than $12 per barrel at the beginning of January, following reports of a big fall in US oil inventories in the first week of December.  But, thereafter, markets had been subdued by profit-taking and the lack of further OPEC production cuts.  The price had fallen to $11.46 per barrel by  6 January. 42 Input prices had fallen again in December, by 1.2%, giving annual deflation of -8.9%.  Since their peak in September 1995, input prices had fallen by 22.4%, and prices were at a level last recorded in 1986.  Output prices excluding excise duties had been unchanged in December, giving annual deflation of -0.8%.  And total annual output price inflation had fallen to zero, its lowest rate since March 1960.  The CBI Industrial Trends survey had suggested a further fall in prices in January.   43 There had been no obvious reaction so far to sterling’s depreciation from export or import price inflation.  Total import prices from the world had fallen by 6.0% in the year to November (-7.0% to October), and total export prices to the world had fallen by 4.7% in the year to November (-5.5% to October). 44 RPI inflation had fallen by 0.2 percentage points to 2.8% in December.  RPIX inflation had risen by 0.1 percentage points to 2.6% in December;  RPIY inflation had risen by 0.2 percentage points to 2.0%.  Seasonal food had become the most inflationary sector in the RPI, as unfavourable weather had again affected supply.  Household goods prices had risen strongly, but over the past decade, household goods prices had risen in December and then fallen sharply in January ‘sales’.  The gap between goods and services price inflation had narrowed in December. 45 The only new data on other measures of inflation since the January MPC meeting had been on the retail sales deflator and the  Inflation Report:  May 1999 64 harmonised consumer prices index (HICP).  Retail sales deflator inflation had risen by 0.4 percentage points to 1.3% in December. HICP inflation had increased by 0.1 percentage points to 1.5%. The increase had been similar to RPIX and for the same reasons, but the 1.1 percentage point gap between the two inflation rates had remained unusually high.  The effect of using the geometric mean in calculating HICP inflation had continued to account for much of that difference.  The geometric mean effect had increased over the past decade, while inflation had declined. 46 The UK HICP had been 0.4 percentage points above the EU average in November.  Although UK goods price inflation had been below the EU average in November, UK services price inflation had been well above average.  VI Agents’ national summary 47 The Bank’s regional Agents gave their assessment of economic developments, drawn from discussions with contacts over the past month.  Construction output had continued to grow, boosted by Millennium, railway and public sector work, but growth had been expected to slow during the course of 1999, reflecting weaker orders.  Housing starts had remained subdued, but there had been some evidence of a recovery in the secondary housing market in certain regions.  Manufacturing contacts had continued to report falling output and excessive stocks, despite extended shutdowns in some areas.  Competition from cheaper imports had remained intense.  Further reductions in output had been expected in the first quarter of 1999, although there appeared to have been some recovery of manufacturing sentiment in some regions, reflecting an improvement in perceived export prospects.   48 Retailers had seen a late surge of sales before Christmas, and there had been quite a strong early start to the January ‘sales’.  But sales of most goods had subsequently fallen off, and most retail contacts still considered their stock levels to be excessive.  Sales of consumer services had continued to grow, but at lower rates than earlier in 1998.  Business service growth had remained strong in a number of regions. 49 Banks had been reporting lower demand for borrowing, as manufacturers deferred new investment plans.  And several of the Bank’s Agents had been told of a rise in late payments by small and medium-sized firms.  But there was some evidence that banks had been attempting to address credit problems more proactively and earlier than they had done in the previous cycle. 50 Manufacturing employment had continued to fall.  A spate of redundancy announcements in the durable goods sectors and elsewhere in recent weeks had yet to reach the official figures, and several firms had indicated that they would be reviewing employment levels again during the first quarter.  Services employment had continued to grow, but at a lower rate. VII Information from financial markets Foreign exchange 51 The sterling effective exchange rate index had appreciated by 1.1% since the 6–7 January MPC meeting and by 0.2% from the (15-day average) starting-point in the November Inflation Report. The central projection in the November Report had assumed a small depreciation over this period and so ‘news’ about the exchange rate amounted to a small appreciation.  But movements  in yield curves in the United Kingdom and overseas had suggested that news about monetary policy had not explained the most  recent appreciation.  Outside forecasts for sterling made at the  start of the year had been on average for a fall of nearly 4% in effective terms through 1999, slightly more than implied by forward rates.   52 Over the month as a whole, the dollar had strengthened markedly.  The appreciation of the euro at the start of its life had been short-lived;  soft data, particularly from Germany, had led to expectations of lower euro interest rates relative to those for the United States.  Initially, the dollar had also fallen sharply against the yen (to a low of ¥108.2 on 11 January), as further short yen positions had been squeezed out.  The floating of the Brazilian real had created some initial nervousness, but had had only limited impact on other currencies. Government bond and money markets 53 UK data and survey releases had raised slightly interest rates implied by the nearest short sterling contracts.  But the longer contracts and the UK bond market had rallied further.  Nominal and real gilt yields had been very low by historical standards and by comparison with other countries with similar or lower inflation. Recovering market confidence and low gilt yields had led to some recovery in non-government sterling bond issuance in the fourth quarter, but a significant proportion had been by supranational bodies.  The yield spread over gilts paid by credits below top quality remained high. 54 UK forward rates implied by gilt yields were below those implied by German government bond yields from five years out. However, forward rates from swap curves had shown  UK-German convergence at medium (7–10 year) maturities. Institutional demand for gilts and limited net issuance might have been having a material effect on gilt yields, pushing them below the level implied by expectations of future interest rates.  Equity and corporate debt markets 55 Although the Brazilian real float had had a positive impact on the local stock market, it had checked the recovery of equity prices in most major countries, though not in Japan.  In a number  of countries, including the United Kingdom, bank share prices  had both fallen absolutely and relative to general indices.   Credit spreads in bond markets and in the swaps market had generally fallen, particularly for lower-rated companies.   Spreads for UK bank bond yields over other UK corporates had also fallen. 56 Downward profit warnings by UK companies in January had again been more numerous than a year earlier.  Trading statements from some general retailers had adversely affected their share prices, although the sector as a whole had not fallen relative to the market.  Small company shares had continued to underperform. Underperformance had appeared cyclical.  Monetary Policy Committee 65 1 The Committee discussed the prospects for the world economy;  money and financial markets;  demand and output;  the implications of the Budget projections for the macroeconomic outlook;  the labour market;  prices;  and other considerations bearing on the decision this month, before turning to its immediate policy decision.  The world economy 2 Activity in the United States economy had again been stronger than expected over the past month.  Indeed, provisional estimates suggested it had contributed around half of the increase in world demand in 1998, well in excess of its 20% share of world output.  The National Association of Purchasing Managers (NAPM) index had strengthened—partly reflecting an improvement in export orders.  This was surprising given recent weakness in the world economy and the strength of the US dollar.  There were, perhaps, some parallels with the UK survey data.  However, the prospects for the US economy as a whole still seemed to be for slowing growth over coming quarters.  On balance, prospects for growth in the euro area had weakened over the month, but with considerable inter-regional variation.  The weak Q4 output data in Germany and Italy had more than counterbalanced some stronger than expected French data.  In Japan, there were now signs that financial restructuring was taking place but, in the short run, this might exacerbate the weakness in credit conditions.  The immediate prospects for activity there did not seem to have changed much over the past month.  Overall, there seemed to be little change in the prospects for UK export demand from developments in other major industrial economies. 3 The situation outside the OECD had not changed much over the past month.  There had been renewed difficulties in Brazil, and the real had weakened.  There was still a risk of contagion, but other major countries in South America were not obviously under pressure.  The lower oil price had already led to lower imports by the oil exporting countries and this could be seen in UK exports, but otherwise developments over the month were much as expected overall. Money and financial markets 4 Narrow money growth continued to be quite strong, and was possibly being influenced by the past reductions in interest rates. Broad money growth was continuing to ease, and it was noticeable that the shorter three and six-month annualised growth rates were below the twelve-month growth rate.  The risks from past rapid growth in broad money had diminished. 5 The sterling effective exchange rate was currently over 2% higher than the 15 day average used as the starting-point for the February Inflation Report projections.  The FT-SE All-Share index had risen by 2% since the February Report.  The rise in share prices was broadly based, with both the FT-SE 100 and Small Capitalisation indexes rising over the period.  This was in contrast with earlier periods when the FT-SE 100 had grown faster than the Small Capitalisation index. 6 The rise in the sterling effective exchange rate reflected the balance of two offsetting bilateral movements;  sterling had depreciated against the US dollar but had appreciated against the euro.  The implications for UK inflation would depend on the reasons for the changes.  Political and economic developments in the euro area probably accounted for some of the depreciation of the euro against the dollar and sterling over the past month.  It was possible that the weakening euro reflected the market’s expectation that prospects for euro-area demand and output growth were weaker than for the United States, and perhaps for the United Kingdom as well given the possibility of faster growth here in late 1999 and 2000.  There was evidence that the movement in interest rate differentials could account for some of the rise in sterling. 7 The rise in the exchange rate and in equity prices would have opposite effects on the central projection for inflation, but the movement in the exchange rate was thought to be the more significant of the two.  To the extent that sterling’s strength persisted it would increase the imbalance between the traded and non-traded sectors of the economy, and would require a strengthening of domestic demand if inflation were not to fall below target. Demand and output 8 The level of GDP in 1998 Q4 had been revised down by 1/4% since the preliminary output estimate available at the time of the February Inflation Report.  The expenditure composition had also been published, and this showed slightly weaker final domestic demand than assumed in the central projection.  The rise in inventories had also been stronger than expected, leaving domestic demand growth a little stronger overall.  But faster domestic demand growth had been offset by a larger negative contribution from net trade (primarily weaker exports), and so GDP growth in the fourth quarter was, at 0.2%, unchanged from the time of the February Report.  The statistical discrepancy between the expenditure and average measure of GDP was 0.6% in 1998 Q4. But due to the suspension of the Average Earnings Index there was no income measure of GDP available for Q4.  Within the output breakdown, the fall in construction output for the third successive quarter seemed surprising given recent orders and survey data. 9 Consumption growth had been revised down in 1998 Q3, but the level in Q4 was not materially different from that expected at the time of the Report.  Hence, the puzzle as to why consumption growth had weakened so much through 1997–8 remained.  Retail sales (around 40% of consumption) had recovered in January, but the underlying picture remained fairly weak.  Consumer confidence in January had risen for the third successive month on the GfK measure.  It was likely that the five reductions in interest rates since the autumn had played a material role in stabilising confidence, but it was difficult to be sure how robust the recent recovery was. More work was needed to understand how consumer confidence was affected by changes in interest rates.  There were also some signs of a pick-up in the housing market, particularly in the indicators which are at the start of the house buying process, such as House Builders Federation site visits and reservations.  There seemed little news in the latest house price figures. 10 The build-up in inventories appeared a little puzzling as it was not apparent in either the official manufacturing or retail distribution figures, where any signs of weaker than expected demand might be expected.  The rise in stocks in the fourth quarter—and for 1998 as a whole—had been concentrated in the ‘other industries’ sector, which included the quarterly alignment adjustment (between the expenditure and output measures of GDP). It was possible that this rise in stocks could partly reflect a change in the pattern of car registrations this year, which would not as yet be accounted for in the usual seasonal adjustment. 11 The news in the national accounts and recent surveys could be interpreted in several ways.  First, the lower level of GDP than in previous estimates, coupled with the build up of inventories, might point to a weaker picture for demand than previously thought.  In particular, the weaker outturn for exports in Q4, and the sharp fall in the volatile non-EU exports figure in January, Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 2–3 March 1999  Inflation Report:  May 1999 66 might point to some of the downside risks to external demand coming through.  But the changes in the composition and revisions to the level of GDP were not particularly large. 12 Second, the lower level of GDP, coupled with the latest survey data, raised the question of whether the low point in output growth might have come a little earlier than previously expected. 13 Third, the surveys, though generally remaining weak, had all been stronger over the past month.  That uniformity was somewhat surprising, and might indicate a slightly better picture than previously thought.  Some of the survey indicators were recovering towards levels recorded last summer, before the sharp deterioration occurred.  Of particular note had been the improvement in export orders in both the CBI and CIPS surveys over the past month.  So to the extent that the surveys had for a while been painting a weaker picture for exports than the ONS data, that gap now appeared to be closing. 14 Overall, the data did not significantly change the picture for demand and output.  The improvement in survey data might prove significant, but had yet to be seen in the official data. The forthcoming Budget 15 Prior to the meeting, the Committee was briefed by Treasury officials about the forthcoming Budget’s expenditure and revenue projections and macroeconomic forecasts, but not the detailed measures.  The overall fiscal position was reported to remain stable, and was in line with the assumptions in the February Inflation Report.  16 At the MPC meeting, the Committee briefly discussed the lower than planned Net Departmental Outlays seen in the first ten months of the 1998/99 fiscal year.  This was primarily related to social security rather than other government departments’ spending on goods and services.  But since the control framework was new this year, it was not known what would happen to spending at the end of the year:  departments had less of an incentive to spend their budgets in the final weeks of the fiscal year as they could carry spending forward to future years, which could have timing consequences for the pattern of real demand. Labour market 17 The Committee had been briefed by Mr King and by Bank staff before the meeting on the review of the Average Earnings Index, which was published on 2 March.  Earnings growth was now estimated to have reached a peak of 5.7% in May 1998, before falling back to 4.5% in November on the headline measure. Preliminary estimates of unit wage costs produced by Bank staff using the revised Average Earnings Index suggested a stronger picture for the first half of 1998 than previously thought, and a weaker picture in the second half of the year with the rate of change flat at around 33/4%. 18 The general pattern of earnings growth through 1998 was broadly consistent with the assumptions that had been made at the time of the February Inflation Report.  That gave the Committee members somewhat greater confidence in the starting assumptions for earnings growth than they had felt at the time of the Report. However, the pace of slowdown in earnings growth was more marked than had been assumed:  starting from a higher level and ending a little below the February assumption.  The level of earnings at the end of 1998 was close to that assumed in the projections.  A preliminary analysis suggested that after making a rough adjustment for hours worked, the profile of the growth of earnings per hour through the second half of the year was broadly flat.  Hence the rise and fall in the headline measure through 1998 was, perhaps, consistent with a higher, then lower, contribution from overtime.  More analysis of the new figures was needed, for example of the contribution of bonuses to earnings growth.  The fall in earnings growth through 1998 would need to be reconciled with the rise in employment and fall in unemployment over this period.  One possible explanation was the fall in inflation expectations discussed at previous meetings.  Among the recommendations made in the review of the AEI were a number of further improvements to the way the series was compiled to bring it up to best practice.  Hence the Committee concluded that it should not, as yet, place great weight on the index.  19 The Bank’s settlements series showed some signs that the peak might have been passed on the twelve-month employment weighted mean measure.  The Reward index had declined on a broadly similar path to the revised Average Earnings Index over 1998. 20 The Committee noted that its central projection for earnings growth remained towards the top end of the range of other forecasts, despite a broadly similar projection for inflation in these forecasts.  The Committee had discussed this during the February Inflation Report round in the context of recent movements in productivity.  It would be necessary to look at the reasons for the differences in projections of real earnings growth, and hence implied profit margins, in the light of the new earnings data. 21 The latest data continued to show rising employment and falling unemployment, though total hours worked had fallen in December.  The rise in employment was partly accounted for by an increase in the number of women in part-time employment.  Both the stock of vacancies and number of new vacancies seemed surprisingly high and seemed to bear out the picture in the employment and unemployment data, suggesting a still tight labour market.  But the latest Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services (FRES) survey showed that the job market index was at its lowest level since 1992.  The three CIPS surveys for manufacturing, construction and services all pointed to falling employment.  It seemed likely that a turning point would soon be seen in the official data. Prices 22 Non-oil commodity prices had risen in January in sterling terms.  There were tentative signs that the deflation might be coming to an end.  The level of commodity prices was still much lower than a year ago, but they would have to keep falling to lower the central projection for inflation compared with February. 23 Contacts of the Bank’s regional Agents were increasingly mentioning that consumers were more ‘price sensitive’ than previously.  The Committee discussed possible explanations for this.  The comment might simply reflect inflation illusion.  Lower inflation over recent years may have made it easier for people to distinguish movements in relative prices from general price inflation.  It seemed likely that the comments also reflected continuing structural changes in the retail industry, for example through a greater use of discount stores, which might be lowering margins.     24 The Committee also noted the rise in inflation expectations at longer maturities over the past month, as measured by the difference between implied forward interest rates on nominal and index linked bonds.  It was too early to place much weight on this movement, which was in any event small by historical standards. There had not been much movement in shorter-term survey-based measures of inflation expectations over the past month. 25 Inflation had turned out a little higher than expected in January, but this reflected movement in the highly volatile seasonal food component.  It was possible that better weather in February would lower some seasonal food prices.  This had no implications for inflation two years or so ahead.  The Committee noted that the timing of the Budget would mean that annual changes in fuel duties—from the previously announced ‘escalator’—would be included in the March RPI figure this year, rather than in April as had been the case in 1998.  This would mean a temporary rise in  Monetary Policy Committee 67 RPIX inflation in March, all other things being equal.  The Committee noted that inflation outturns had been at, or above, 21/2% since the introduction of the new policy framework in 1997.  These outturns were more surprising given the mainly dampening shocks to world demand and prices.  It would be important to consider whether there were any lessons from this. 26 The GDP deflator had risen 2.8% in the year to 1998 Q4, and was the highest for some time.  However, the increase in the annual rate partly reflected a low figure in 1997 Q4 dropping out of the comparison, as well as some terms of trade effects.  The rise in the household expenditure deflator was still below 2% in the year to Q4.   Other considerations bearing on the decision this month 27 Before turning to the immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed a number of other considerations.  First, should the Committee seek to offset the projected weak GDP growth in the first half of 1999?  Even if demand and output were turning out weaker than expected, the lags in the operation of monetary policy had previously been assumed to be such that only a limited effect on activity would be possible.  However it was possible that there were signs, for example in the confidence surveys, of a more rapid response to changes in interest rates than had been the case in the past.  One possible explanation was that the new monetary policy regime provided greater confidence in the commitment to the inflation target which was consistent with the fall in inflation expectations, and might help to explain the moderation of earnings growth since mid 1998. 28 Second, the exchange rate had risen, especially in recent days, to a level above that implied by the central projection in the February Inflation Report, despite the 50 basis point reduction in interest rates at the previous meeting.  By itself this would tend to reduce import prices and retail prices, and might justify a reduction in interest rates.  But it was too soon to judge whether the rise would persist, and what reaction there would be to a further reduction in rates.  In any case, it would not be sensible for policy to react to high frequency movements in the exchange rate, as this could lead to a volatile path for interest rates from month to month, and might make it more difficult for others to understand the motives for interest rate changes.  29 Third, the Committee considered whether there was any particular significance in changing interest rates so soon after an Inflation Report round.  Some members felt that clear news was needed for rates to change so shortly after the last forecast; otherwise, it would appear to downgrade the value and role of the projections. The immediate policy decision 30 There were four key developments over the month.  First, the revised earnings data had been published.  Second, the effective exchange rate had strengthened.  Third, if anything, the GDP figures were weaker than expected, particularly if weight were placed on the rise in inventories and/or the sharper than expected fall in exports.  Finally, there had been a uniform strengthening of survey measures, albeit from a low level.  On balance, these four factors suggested slightly lower prospective inflation than thought at the time of the February Inflation Report.  31 Some possible reasons for a further reduction in interest rates were identified.  If, for example, it was expected that the rise in sterling would be maintained, there might be a case for a 25 basis point reduction in interest rates this month.  Second, maintaining rates at their current level this month might be interpreted as a signal that a floor in rates had been reached, which might stall—or even reverse—the recovery in business and consumer sentiment.  32 One view was that the news on the month did not, as yet, amount to a sufficient case for a further reduction in interest rates. It would be better to see more evidence, in particular whether the strength in the surveys was maintained and whether it began to feed through to the official data.  There would also be a benefit in undertaking more analysis of the revised earnings data.  On this view, the repo rate should be maintained at 5.5%.  Among those members holding this view, some felt that it was now slightly more likely than a month ago that there would be a further reduction. 33 The Committee discussed whether, even though there was not a compelling case for an immediate 25 basis point reduction in rates, there might be a case for a smaller reduction.  There could be a case for moving in smaller steps than 25 basis points if the data warranted it.  However, since the Committee had not previously made changes in anything other than multiples of 25 basis points, there would be a risk of providing a confusing signal to markets. Some members also thought it would imply a degree of fine-tuning beyond what was sensible.   34 Another view was that interest rates should be close to or possibly below the ‘neutral’ level at this point in the economic cycle.  On that view, the reduction in rates of 50 basis points at the February meeting had brought the level of interest rates into its probable neutral range.  The news over the past month reinforced the view that interest rates might need to be reduced further.  But we had only started to see the effects of previous interest rate reductions, and nominal long and short-term interest rates were now close to their lowest level for many years.  The reactions of firms and households—both savers and borrowers—to such historically unusual levels were difficult to predict with much confidence.  Although the direction of interest rates was still more likely than not to be down, there was no urgency this month and it was best to observe how the economy reacted to the earlier interest rate reductions.  On this view, therefore, the repo rate should be maintained at 5.5%. 35 Another view in February had been that a reduction in rates of 75–100 basis points was required.  That view had been predicated on the assumption that first, the central projection in the Inflation Report was around 0.2 percentage points too high;  and second, that it was possible to ease with a view to supporting activity in the near term without endangering achievement of the inflation target.  This was especially true if the transmission mechanism was faster than had, on average, been the case in the past.  The news on the month suggested that both activity and inflation might be a little lower than expected, and could justify a reduction in interest rates over and above what had been thought necessary a month ago.  On this view, a reduction of 25–50 basis points was now required. 36 The Governor invited members of the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate be maintained at 5.5%. Eight members of the Committee (the Governor, Mervyn King, David Clementi, Alan Budd, Charles Goodhart, DeAnne Julius, Ian Plenderleith and John Vickers) voted for the proposition. Willem Buiter voted against, preferring a reduction of 0.4%. 37 The following members of the Committee were present: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Alan Budd Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers 38 Gus O’Donnell was present as the Treasury representative.  Inflation Report:  May 1999 68 1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by the Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee on 26 February, in advance of its meeting on 2–3 March 1999.  At the start of the Committee meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and that information is included in the Annex. I Monetary conditions 2 Growth of notes and coin had picked up in February.  After adjusting for the effects of the introduction of the new 50 pence and £2 coins, the three-month growth rate was 7.0%, compared with 6.7% in January, and the six-month growth rate was 6.2%, compared with 5.9% in January.  The one-month growth rate was 0.5%, the same as in January and a little higher than the average figure for 1998.  A small increase in these growth rates might  have been expected following interest rate cuts in the second half  of 1998, which reduced the opportunity cost of holding notes and coin. 3 The stock of M4 had fallen by £10 million in January.  The twelve-month growth rate had fallen to 7.3%, the lowest since June 1995. 4 Within M4, the balances of other financial corporations (OFCs) had fallen by £2.6 billion in January, making it less likely that December’s modest increase was a purely temporary effect associated with the end of the financial year.  The twelve-month growth rate, at 11.0%, had more than halved over the past year. 5 Following the introduction of self-assessment, January had become a more important month for payment of income tax.  It seemed unlikely that this had yet had its full effect on the estimated seasonal component, which may in turn explain why the strong flow into household sector M4 in December (+£5.5 billion) had been followed by a much weaker January (+£1.7 billion).  Looking at the average flow over these two months, the gradual pick-up in household sector M4 towards the end of last year appeared to have continued. 6 Private non financial corporations (PNFCs’) holdings of M4 had risen by £0.9 billion in January, largely reversing a £1.0 billion fall in December.  Payments of corporation tax in January had been significantly lower than in recent years.  Hence there was a risk that the process of seasonally adjusting the monetary aggregates, which looks at the past behaviour of each series, had artificially lowered PNFCs’ M4 in December 1998 and artificially boosted it in January 1999.  Averaging over these two months, the flow was close to zero. 7 Sterling lending by M4 institutions had grown by 0.5% in January, the same rate as in December.  But the three, six and twelve-month growth rates had all fallen, and remained below rates during the first half of 1998. 8 M4 lending to OFCs had fallen by £0.3 billion in January. This was smaller than the fall in their M4 deposits, so OFCs’ net recourse to banks had increased.  During the fourth quarter of 1998, lending to OFCs had been underpinned by lending to financial leasing companies.  According to less comprehensive data from the Major British Banking Group, the contribution of lending to financial leasing companies in January was again strong (up by 1.0%). 9 M4 lending to the household sector had risen by 0.6% in January.  Total lending to individuals (excluding lending to unincorporated businesses, but including lending by a number of non-M4 institutions) had also risen by 0.6%.  The twelve-month growth rate was 7.7%.  Lending secured on dwellings had risen by 0.5% in January, as in each month since August 1998.  There had been a small rise in the rate of unsecured credit growth, from 0.7% in December to 1.4% in January.  The three and six-month annualised growth rates were 14.3% and 15.6% respectively, below those during the first half of last year. 10 Turning to price indicators of monetary conditions, more than half the institutions sampled by the Bank had not passed on in full the most recent cut in official rates to their standard variable mortgage rates.  For the time being, this was probably of limited significance;  since September 1998, standard variable mortgage rates had fallen by 198 basis points, only 2 basis points less than the fall in official rates over the same period. 11 Since the February MPC meeting, there had been some rise in medium to long-term inflation expectations (as derived from a comparison of the yield on nominal and index-linked gilts).  Much of the rise, particularly at the ten-year horizon, occurred on  4 February, the day when official rates were reduced by 50 basis points.  By contrast, there had been little change in survey measures of inflation expectations for end 1999 and end 2000.  These remained at around 2.2% to 2.3%. II Demand and output 12 GDP at constant market prices had grown by 0.2% in  1998 Q4, but the annual rate had been revised down to 1.3% from 1.6%.  The expenditure breakdown had shown domestic demand growing by 1.2% in Q4, reflecting a sharp increase in investment and inventories.  Net trade had made a negative contribution to GDP growth of -1.1%.  The shortfall of the expenditure measure of GDP relative to the average measure was 0.6% of GDP in Q4. 13 Growth in household spending had increased to 0.4% from 0.1% in Q3.  Bank staff had not expected total household spending growth in Q4 to be as weak as had been suggested by retail sales volumes.  The level of spending in Q3 had been revised down by 0.1 percentage points, but there had been upward revisions in the first half of 1998. 14 Investment had grown by 2.0% in Q4.  Growth had also been revised up in Q3 to 1.8% from 1.1%.  The strength in Q4 was partly because of erratic factors.  Nevertheless, sectoral growth rates had been broadly consistent with survey evidence on investment intentions:  service sector investment growth had remained strong at 5.2%, and manufacturing investment had declined by 3.1%.  The annual growth of whole-economy investment had slowed during 1998. 15 Inventories had risen sharply by £1.9 billion in Q4, but the level had been revised down by a cumulative £215 million in the first three quarters of 1998.  Stock building in ‘other industries’ had accounted for £1.6 billion of the rise.  This category includes the quarterly alignment, which was constrained to sum to zero in the year as a whole.  Unless there had been very large revisions to the alignment adjustment—and stocks data had not supported this—it could explain only a part of the overall increase in other industries’ stocks.  ‘Other industries’ included car dealers, for whom stocks may have been boosted by the switch to twice-yearly registration periods starting in March.  Stocks in the manufacturing and retail sector had made a negative contribution to GDP growth. Manufacturers’ stocks of finished goods had risen by £113 million, less than half the increase in Q3.  But survey evidence had indicated a continued stock overhang.  The CBI monthly trends survey had recorded a small increase in the balance on excess Annex:  Summary of data presented by Bank staff  Monetary Policy Committee 69 stocks of finished goods to +24 in February from +23 in January, and the balance had remained well above its long-run average. 16 In Q4, exports had declined sharply by 2.4%, and imports had increased by 0.9%.  In 1998, there had been tentative signs that the slowdown in final demand had reduced import growth. Looking ahead, the CBI survey shows exporters increasingly less pessimistic about prospects, with the balance on optimism rising to -18 in January from -41 in October.  But the CBI export orders balance had remained negative.  Monthly trade data had shown that the decline in exports to non-EU countries had continued in January, with goods exports, excluding oil and erratic items, declining by 6.8%. 17 Manufacturing output had fallen by 1.3% in Q4.  Service sector output had increased by 0.6%, compared with 0.8% in Q3. Within the service sector, output had continued to grow strongly in the transport/communications and finance/business sectors.  Output had been unchanged in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, consistent with weak retail sales in Q4.  Construction output had declined for the third quarter in a row, by 0.2%. 18 The gross operating surplus of corporations had declined by 0.2% in Q4.  19 Retail sales volumes had risen by 1.1% in January, more than reversing the decline in December.  But the underlying trend had been unchanged, with sales volumes in the three months to January 1.5% higher than a year earlier.  Sales of clothing, footwear and household goods had grown particularly strongly, partly because of sharp price-discounting.  A survey by the Bank’s regional Agents covering 108 retailers had supported the view that spending was weak.  A majority of respondents had reported declining sales values in December and January relative to a  year earlier.  Consumer confidence was cited as a key reason.   This had implied a sharper slowdown than indicated by the official data. 20 House price inflation had slowed.  The Bank’s house price index based on Land Registry data had risen 5.9% in the year to Q4 (down from 7.9% in Q3) and the Halifax house price index had risen by 3.7% in the year to February (down from 4.4% in January). There had been preliminary signs that activity might have turned up.  The House Builders’ Federation survey in January had shown the first positive balances in seven months on visitors to sites and on net reservations compared with a year earlier.  These had been leading indicators of housing transactions in the past.  Particulars delivered had risen in February for the second month running.  But the recovery was from a low level, and transactions had been 3% lower than a year earlier.  The firming-up in housing activity had been consistent with some recovery in consumer confidence.  The GfK confidence indicator had risen to -0.6% in February from a trough of -8.2% in October. 21 Survey evidence had continued to indicate declining manufacturing output in the first two months of 1999 Q1.  The output balance of the CBI Trends survey was -10 in February compared with -13 in January.  The CIPS survey output balance had remained below 50 in February, for the eleventh month running. But there had been continued signs of an easing in the rate of decline of new orders, mainly because of a bottoming-out in export orders.  In the service sector, the CIPS business activity index had remained below 50 for the fourth successive month, indicating contracting output, although the rate of decline had eased. III International environment 22 US GDP had risen by 1.5% in the fourth quarter, according to the preliminary estimate.  Industrial production was flat in January, and had been growing at around 1.7% on a year earlier for the past three months.  Although monthly data had suggested some stabilisation in the trade balance, further falls in net exports were expected in 1999, reflecting slowing growth in the euro area and Latin America.  Retail sales growth had slowed in January but this may have simply reflected one-off factors.  Consumer confidence had risen again in February, most notably in the ‘current conditions’ index.  Industrial confidence, as measured by the National Association of Purchasing Managers Index, had also risen in February.  Manufacturing employment had continued to fall, but service sector job growth remained robust, so that overall employment growth remained above that of the labour force. Despite strong monetary growth and robust real GDP growth, annual inflation remained subdued and was unchanged in January at 1.6%. 23 In the euro area, imbalances between the consumer and producer sectors had persisted.  Euro-area GDP had risen by 2.7% on a year earlier in the third quarter.  French GDP had risen by 0.7% in the fourth quarter.  In Germany, GDP had fallen by 0.4% in the fourth quarter.  The contribution from net trade to quarterly German growth was -0.8 percentage points, the largest quarterly negative contribution since 1993 Q2.  German services output had grown by 1.0% in the fourth quarter, compared with 1.1% in the previous quarter.  The French survey of service sector output had tracked the official measure of output fairly closely in recent years, and pointed to a moderate slowdown in service sector growth in 1999 Q1.  Euro-area industrial production growth had fallen by 0.4% in the year to December, compared with 3.2% in the year to October.  Euro-area industrial confidence had stabilised in January, close to its historical average.  Euro-area consumer confidence had risen to zero in January from -1 in December;  this compared  with -9 in January 1998.  Inflation in the euro area on the harmonised measure fell to 0.8% on a year earlier in December, from 0.9% in November.  In January, the three-month moving average of the twelve-month growth rate of M3 increased to 4.9%, compared with the reference rate of 4.5% set by the European Central Bank. 24 The Bank of Japan had lowered the overnight discount rate to a range below 15 basis points on 12 February.  The Ministry of Finance had also partially reversed its position on Trust Fund Bureau purchases of Japanese government bonds (JGBs), allowing the Bureau to resume outright purchases of JGBs in the secondary market.  The yen had subsequently weakened further and 10 year bond yields had fallen back below 2%.  Retail sales had remained weak in January, falling by 4.5% on a year earlier.  Industrial production had risen by 0.8% in January, but it was still down by 7.5% over the past twelve months.  Industrial production had fallen by 6.9% in 1998 as a whole.  The inventory index was at its lowest level since February 1995.  The Japanese trade surplus had widened in January to 760 billion yen, compared with 386 billion yen in January 1998.  The growth in the surplus had reflected the weak state of Japanese private demand in 1998.  It had also reflected the fall in commodity prices which, alongside more recent strength in the yen, had lowered the value of imports.  The Consensus Economics average of forecasts for GDP growth in 1999 was unchanged at -1.1% in February.   IV The labour market 25 Employment had continued to grow strongly at the end of 1998.  According to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), employment in Q4 was 122,000 (0.4%) higher than in Q3, and 305,000 (1.1%) higher than in 1997 Q4.  The main contribution to the rise in Q4 had come from growth in the number of employees, but the number of self-employed people had also risen, reversing the recent downward trend.  A full sectoral breakdown was not yet available, but monthly data had showed that manufacturing jobs had fallen  by some 2% in the year to Q4.  The February manufacturing  survey from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) had suggested that employment in the sector had continued to fall in early 1999, though at a slightly slower rate.  The  CIPS surveys on services and construction, and the report on jobs from the Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services  Inflation Report:  May 1999 70 (FRES), had pointed to declines in employment, as they had for some time. 26 Though employment had continued to rise in 1998, hours worked had been broadly flat.  Total hours worked had fallen by 0.2% in Q4, and average hours per worker were 0.6% lower.  About half of the fall in average hours worked had reflected a rise in the number of part-time jobs.  The other half had reflected a fall in average hours worked by full-time workers, consistent with a reduction in overtime working. 27 The number of jobs advertised in national newspapers had fallen in January, according to the Press Recruitment Advertising Index.  The stock of unfilled Job-centre vacancies had also fallen, by 2,200 in January.  But new vacancy notifications had remained at a high level, rising by 9,300 in January after falls in November and December.  Overall, the Bank’s regional Agents had reported a broadly unchanged level of skills shortages.  But significant sectoral differences had persisted.  Skills shortages were declining in the financial sector, according to the most recent CBI/Price Waterhouse Coopers survey, and were flat to falling in the small business sector, according to the Small Business Research Trust. But shortages in the construction sector were reported to be back at their 1997 peaks by the Federation of Master Builders. 28 The rise in employment in Q4 had been accompanied by further falls in both inactivity and unemployment.  The LFS measure of unemployment had fallen by 15,000 in Q4, and the claimant count had fallen by 5,700 in January.  But unemployment rates had been unchanged, at 6.2% and 4.6% respectively.  There was still no evidence of the reported rise in redundancies in the inflows to the claimant count, which fell by a further 6,500 in January.  Exit rates had remained at historically high levels. Unemployment of six months or more among 18 to 24 year olds had been falling by around 6,000 a month.  Some of this probably reflected the impact of the Government’s New Deal for young people.  But, in net terms, all of the rise in employment in Q4 had been accounted for by workers aged 35 or over. 29 The Average Earnings Index had been reinstated on 2 March, following the conclusion of an independent review commissioned by the Chancellor.  The headline earnings measure had been available up to July 1998 under the suspended series.  According to the new series, headline whole-economy annual average earnings growth had fallen from 5.1% in August to 4.5% in November, reflecting a decline in the growth of both regular and irregular pay. There had also been extensive revisions to the back data, reflecting a number of changes in the method of calculation.  In contrast to the suspended series—which had been relatively volatile—the new series showed headline earnings growth rising steadily from a trough of around 21/2% in 1995 to a peak of 5.7% in May 1998. 30 Other data had also suggested a more subdued outlook for settlements and earnings in recent months.  The Reward index  of annual earnings growth had continued to fall, from a peak  of 5.4% in June 1998 to 4.6% in January.  The Bank’s  employment-weighted twelve-month mean measure of  whole-economy settlements had remained at 3.7% in January, but the private sector measure had fallen by 0.1 percentage points to 3.9%.  In a matched sample of firms from the Bank’s settlements database, 86% of employees settling in January had received  a lower settlement in 1999 than they had in 1998.  The employment-weighted mean for this sample had fallen from 3.8% in 1998 to 3.2% in 1999.  The three-month settlements measures from the CBI, Industrial Relations Services and Engineering Employers’ Federation had also all fallen in January.  And the Bank’s regional Agents reported that falling profits and subdued business optimism had led to an easing in pay pressures in manufacturing.  But it was possible that there would be some rise in whole-economy settlements in April, when the National Minimum Wage and the settlement agreed by the Public Sector Review Bodies both came into effect. V Prices 31 Commodity price deflation had continued to moderate;  in January the Bank’s (provisional) index, excluding oil, had fallen by 5.2% on a year earlier, compared with -7.4% in December.  Natural disasters and sterling’s depreciation had increased the sterling price of imported commodities in January;  the (provisional) index had risen by 1.1%.  Food price deflation had moderated following the unwinding of the downward shocks experienced since mid-1996. Annual inflation had been zero in December.  But forthcoming potential reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy looked likely to decrease prices.  The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was estimating a direct effect of up to -0.3 percentage points on the RPI in the year following implementation, assuming full  pass-through of the cuts to retail prices. 32 The one-month futures price of Brent crude oil had averaged $10.50 in February, down from $11.09 in January—the effects of a report of falling inventories and cold weather in the United States in January had been short-lived.  Manufacturers’ material input prices had risen by 0.4% in January, reflecting the rise in oil prices, but there had been no clear change in the downward trend.  Annual inflation had remained negative at -6.7%. 33 Manufacturers’ output price inflation had remained at historically low levels.  Excluding excise duties, prices had fallen for the seventh consecutive month in January, by 0.2%, leaving them 0.8% below their level a year ago.  Total output prices had been flat year on year.  The CBI industrial trends survey had pointed to further price falls. 34 Trade prices for goods had continued to decline in December.  Total import prices of goods had fallen by 6.4% in the year to December;  total export prices of goods had fallen by 3.8%. In contrast, national accounts data showed that services export prices had risen by 1.4% and import prices by 0.1% in Q4.  The annual rate of increase of the GDP deflator had risen to 2.8% in  Q4 1998, from 2.0% in Q3.  The sharp rise was partly explained  by the volatile path of quarterly inflation in 1997, and by increased contributions from government, trade and inventories prices.   The household expenditure deflator, at 1.9%, had remained below RPIX inflation.  That rise had led to a 0.8 percentage point rise in the GDP deflator based measure of domestically generated inflation, to 3.2%.  The RPI-based measure had remained unchanged at 4.9%. 35 RPIX inflation had remained at 2.6% in January.  RPIY inflation had been 2.0%.  RPIX services inflation had fallen by  0.1 percentage points to 3.4%, and RPIX goods inflation had remained at 1.4%.  Total food price inflation had risen above RPIX inflation.   36 HICP inflation had increased by 0.1 percentage points in January for the third consecutive month, to 1.6%.  The difference between HICP and RPIX inflation had fallen by 0.1 percentage points to 1.0 percentage points, of which  0.5 percentage points was due to the method of calculation and 0.4 percentage points to the exclusion of various owner-occupied housing costs. VI Agents’ national summary 37 The Bank’s regional Agents reported on their assessment of the economy drawn from their discussions with contacts over the past month.  Overall, the recent decline in manufacturing activity appeared to have eased significantly, and destocking was well under way.  Nonetheless, performance had remained dependent on sector.  For example, railway and aerospace demand had been strong, while textiles, ceramics and electrical components manufacturers had continued to suffer from intense import competition.  There had been few reports of any increases in output. One exception had been exports to Europe, where some contacts had won back orders as sterling had depreciated.  But demand from  Monetary Policy Committee 71 France and Germany had begun to decline by the end of the period. Construction sector activity had remained buoyant, but enquiries and orders had begun to decline.  Demand for commercial developments had been weaker in the north of the United Kingdom than in the south east.  Housing market activity had increased since January, especially at the higher-quality end of the market. Increased investment in city-centre property had been reported. Growth in output of business services had declined, reflecting weak manufacturing activity.  For example, hauliers had reported falling demand, and corporate travel suppliers had noted trading-down to less expensive travel options.  But demand for financial services and telecommunications had remained strong.  Retail sales growth had been weak in February;  as yet, retailers had reported little increase in consumer demand following the recent interest cuts. Consumer demand for leisure services, such as gymnasiums, overseas holidays and restaurants had remained strong. 38 In the manufacturing sector, employment had fallen and the decline was expected to continue.  That had increased concern about employment prospects, and had reduced wage demands. Declining activity had lowered overtime and bonus payments. Growth in service sector pay settlements had remained above manufacturing but had continued to fall, reflecting a decline in activity.  Skill shortages had persisted (heavy goods vehicle drivers, precision engineers, accountants and lawyers, for example), but not worsened.  Raw materials, intermediate and finished goods prices had continued to fall.  Retailers had continued to cut prices in order to reduce high stock levels.  Investment intentions had declined across the board.  Manufacturers had continued to invest to improve productivity, rather than to expand capacity.  And an increasing number of service sector contacts had postponed expansion plans. VII Information from financial markets Foreign exchange 39 The US dollar had continued to strengthen since the previous meeting, and now stood about 7% higher against both the yen and the euro compared with the beginning of the year.  The yen had weakened following a cut in interest rates, and there had been statements by the Japanese authorities indicating that they were more comfortable with a weaker yen.  The euro had weakened following the release of weaker-than-expected economic data for the euro area. 40 Sterling had appreciated in effective terms, although it was now at an 18-month low against the stronger dollar.  Sterling’s implied volatility had risen since the previous MPC meeting, but was still lower than at the beginning of the year.  Options data suggested that the probability of a large sterling fall against the euro had declined. Government bond and money markets 41 Expectations for UK interest rates in 1999 had fallen, but had risen looking two years or more forward.  The market’s reaction to the minutes of the previous MPC meeting had been a major reason for this.  Three-month Libor rates were now expected to rise after falling to a level of 5%.  In the United States, rates expected for next year and beyond had risen by around 50 basis points, primarily because of Fed Chairman Greenspan’s  Humphrey-Hawkins testimony.  Near-term euribor rates had remained broadly unchanged.  The gilt yield curve had flattened, with yields rising most for maturities between five and ten years. In general, bond prices abroad had also weakened since the previous meeting, with the exception of Japan. Equity and corporate debt markets 42 The UK stock market had risen, and the FT-SE 100 index  had touched an all-time high.  In contrast, the US market had  fallen since the previous MPC meeting, driven by the  Humphrey-Hawkins testimony.  The other main international indices had remained broadly unchanged. 43 In the United States, credit spreads for the most highly rated firms had fallen by 8 basis points, but spreads for lower-credit firms had risen by 5 basis points.  In the United Kingdom, credit spreads for highly rated firms had fallen by about 15 basis points, and by more than 30 basis points for lower-credit firms.  Swap spreads in the United States had risen slightly, but had fallen at all maturities in the United Kingdom. 44 Analysts’ and fund managers’ forecasts of corporate earnings in 2000 had been revised up slightly since the previous MPC meeting.  Profit warnings had declined in February compared with the previous three months, and for the first time in several months the level was below that recorded a year ago.  Compared with February 1998, there had been a sharp decline in the proportion of firms citing the strength of sterling or problems in emerging markets as the reason for their worsened performance.  Inflation Report:  May 1999 72 The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee today voted to maintain the Bank’s repo rate at 5.5%. The minutes of the meeting will be published at 9.30 am on Wednesday 17 March. Text of Bank of England press notice of 3 March 1999 Bank of England maintains interest rates at 5.5%  Monetary Policy Committee 73 Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 7–8 April 1999 1 The Committee discussed the prospects for the world economy;  the exchange rate, money and credit;  demand and output (including business confidence indicators);  the housing market;  the labour market;  prices;  and other issues including tactics, before turning to its immediate policy decision. The world economy 2 The Committee discussed whether the prospects for the world economy had improved over the past month.  In the United States, domestic demand in particular had continued to grow strongly, with little sign yet of any slowdown in growth or any pick-up in inflation.  Supply side developments in the United States appeared to be more favourable than in the euro area, although in several European countries output remained below potential. Growth was sluggish and industrial sentiment weak, particularly in Germany.  Meanwhile expectations had grown of a reduction in interest rates by the European Central Bank (ECB).  In Japan, the Nikkei had recovered strongly in the last few weeks of the financial year, with buying from foreign investors amid signs of a higher probability of corporate restructuring.  But any recovery in business sentiment had been muted—and might be reversed—while consumer confidence could be further damaged by record levels of unemployment. 3 Outside the major industrial countries, spreads on emerging market sovereign dollar debt—as measured by J P Morgan—had fallen by over 200 basis points during the month.  Sentiment—and in some cases activity—was a little stronger in East Asia and Latin America, where some countries had benefited from higher oil prices.  The markets appeared to have discounted a deterioration in prospects in Russia.  So in general, developments in the world economy seemed much as expected in the February Inflation Report, although the downside risks to activity might have diminished somewhat.  A major uncertainty was over the events in Kosovo, where the effects on consumer and business confidence elsewhere, and on the budgetary positions of the NATO countries, were not yet clear. 4 There were some signs that commodity prices had begun to bottom out, and oil prices had risen sharply as a result of agreed cutbacks in supply.  While it was too soon to judge whether these increases would persist, the cutbacks appeared to have greater credibility in the market than had sometimes been the case.  The downward pressure on world prices from oil and other commodities might therefore be less than in the recent past.  But with most economies outside the United States below productive capacity, the scope for a generalised pick-up in inflation was limited. The exchange rate, money and credit 5 For most of the month sterling had been stronger than at the time of the previous meeting of the Committee, particularly against the euro, although it had weakened a little in recent days.  But the effective exchange rate index remained over 2% higher than implied by the central projection in the February Inflation Report. Many possible explanations had been advanced for sterling’s strength, and discussed by the Committee in this as in previous meetings.  If this strength in the exchange rate were sustained, it would tend to dampen inflation, and also activity in the internationally traded sectors of the economy. 6 So far as money was concerned, growth rates for M4 had continued to slow, as expected, with a sharp decrease in the contribution from other financial corporations (OFCs).  Growth in M4 lending had also slowed further. Demand and output 7 The Committee discussed the revisions made to the estimates of the level and composition of GDP for 1997 and 1998.  Since the February Inflation Report, the estimated level of GDP at market prices in 1998 Q4 had been reduced by 1/2%, although by only 1/4% when measured at basic prices.  This had consequences for measures of the output gap and labour productivity.  The implications for future price developments were unclear.  On one interpretation, this implied that there was less pressure on capacity and that, given the lags involved, the effects of slower GDP growth had yet to feed through fully into lower inflation.  On an alternative view, it suggested a less favourable short-run trade-off between activity and inflation;  inflation was unchanged and either capacity utilisation was lower, core inflation higher or estimates of capacity had been reduced.  But the size of the changes had not been large, and it was not clear on either view how much significance should be attached to this. 8 Estimates for the growth of GDP in 1998 Q4 had also been revised downwards, to 0.1% over the previous quarter.  Within this total, the weakest demand components had been government consumption and net trade.  In contrast private consumption and investment had been revised up, significantly so in the case of business investment.  At the same time, the downwards revision to inventories suggested that the risks of a significant stock cycle in 1999 had diminished, particularly since stocks held by manufacturers and retailers appeared under control.  This interpretation was in line with earlier survey evidence for these sectors.  But because of the downwards revision to the level of GDP, the estimated stock-output ratio was little changed. 9 Retail sales volumes had declined in February, and on a three month average had been only 1% above the levels of a year earlier. But the CBI distributive trades survey suggested that a trough might have been reached, and spending on services, which was not included in retail sales, had continued to grow faster than spending on goods.  The GfK consumer confidence index was now positive for the first time in nine months.  When taken together with other information on consumer spending, the data appeared in line with the Inflation Report projections for consumption in the first quarter of 1999. 10 The Committee considered the prospects for investment. The financial deficit of the private non-financial corporations (PNFCs) had widened to 3% of GDP, the highest level since 1990. This might in part reflect the growth of business investment in the second half of 1998.  The increase appeared to have been most marked in the services sector, and might represent a bringing forward of IT-related spending ahead of the millennium.  The millennium might also boost spending on construction this year, with signs, perhaps, that next year would be less buoyant.  All  this might have implications for the profile of activity over the next two years.  But work by Bank staff suggested that movements in the credit and money holdings of the PNFCs were consistent both with the recent strength of investment, and continued growth in 1999. 11 The Committee agreed that the Budget contained little that altered the outlook for inflation.  At its previous meeting it had decided that the figures for the overall fiscal position, on which the Committee had been briefed, were in line with the assumptions made in the February Inflation Report.  Following the Budget itself, an analysis of the implications of the detailed measures for the composition of demand suggested that these should not have a significant additional effect on the prospects for activity and inflation over the forecast period.  Inflation Report:  May 1999 74 12 Forward-looking survey evidence continued to suggest an improvement (from a low base) in business confidence in all sectors of the economy.  But official data and that from surveys indicated that manufacturing output was still declining, and information from the Bank’s regional Agents suggested that in this sector in particular, confidence remained fragile.  By contrast, the CIPS index for services output had risen above 50, indicating growth rather than contraction, for the first time since October.  The  sharp fall seen in the second half of 1998 might have been partly  in response to events in financial markets at that time.  A recovery in confidence had therefore been expected, with the readings  now consistent with the central projection for output in 1999 contained in the February Inflation Report.  The CIPS survey for construction had also strengthened, in line with other indicators for that sector. 13 All in all, the data suggested that the prospects for activity were little different from those expected at the time of the February Inflation Report.  The downwards revision to the level of GDP had been interpreted by some commentators as reducing inflationary pressures, but the size of the revision of GDP measured at basic prices was small, and the implications for inflation ambiguous.  At the same time, significant changes had been made to the composition of demand, particularly to investment and stockbuilding.  While the recovery in business confidence had yet to be reflected in official figures, this was to be expected given the lags involved. The housing market 14 There had been a sharp increase in the Halifax and Nationwide house price indices in March.  Data from the House Builders Federation on net reservations and site visits, together with figures on loan approvals and particulars delivered, suggested that turnover in the housing market had risen.  The increase had followed a sharp fall towards the end of 1998, and the turnaround might have been influenced by the fall in interest rates since October. The labour market 15 Employment had continued to rise, with the LFS measure increasing by 119,000 in the last three months.  However, much of this increase had been in part-time employment, and on a full time equivalent basis the increase had probably been closer to 50,000. Total hours worked had fallen, and the unemployment rate had risen.  The effects of this on consumer confidence may not yet have been seen.  The surveys were mixed;  while some suggested a sharp downturn in the demand for labour, with the Manpower survey showing the weakest job prospects since 1993, the CIPS employment index had risen slightly, but remained below 50. 16 The latest data for average earnings growth continued the fall seen since the new series was released.  The headline figure had reached 4.3% in December.  This decline was linked to a reduction in hours worked per head, and to a negative contribution from bonuses. 17 Data on settlements also indicated a decline in nominal wage pressures, although inflation expectations appeared to have fallen by even more.  The decline in settlements was not yet apparent from the headline twelve month figures, but for a matched sample of firms from the Bank’s database, settlements this year were running at 3.3% in January and February, as against 4% the previous year. Prices 18 The implications of a reduction in earnings growth for inflation would depend on a variety of factors, including developments in productivity, margins and import prices. Productivity growth over the past three years had been below its  40 year average.  It was difficult to know how much weight to attach to observed productivity growth over such a short period. But relatively small differences in assumptions about productivity could have a material effect on the projections for inflation over the next two years.  More generally, the pass-through from unit labour costs to prices was not straightforward.  It would depend, among other things, on cyclical conditions and on other input prices. These issues would be looked at again in the forthcoming Inflation Report round. 19 Oil prices were much higher than a month ago, although some rise had already been assumed in the central projection in the February Inflation Report. These increases would exert some upwards pressure on input prices, particularly since the falls in  non-oil commodity prices might be coming to an end.  Depending on the path of the exchange rate, domestic inflationary pressures might come more to the fore in determining the path of RPIX, even if competition from imports remained intense.  On the other hand, the recent falls in non-oil commodity prices had been steeper than expected, and the exchange rate had strengthened.  The balance between domestic and international inflationary pressures would be examined in the context of the next Inflation Report. 20 The most recent figure for RPIX inflation—at 2.4%—had been below the target for the first time since the Committee had been established.  This had been despite some strength in the price of seasonal foods, which might unwind in coming months.  But the difference from the 2.5% target was very small, and of little relevance to the prospects for inflation two years ahead.  Next month it was very likely that RPIX inflation would be above target as a result of the timing of Budget measures, which would affect petrol prices in March as compared with April last year.  But this effect would last for only a month, and should have no implications for inflation in two years’ time. Tactical considerations 21 The Committee noted that a reduction in rates was widely expected this month, although rather less universally than had been the case a week earlier.  There was also a growing feeling in the market that the ECB might reduce its rates later that day.  Should either factor influence the Committee’s thinking? 22 It was possible that a decision to leave interest rates unchanged would be interpreted as a signal that current levels would be the trough of this interest rate cycle.  It was also possible that a similar conclusion might be reached from an unexpectedly large reduction in rates.  Given that any decision was open to misinterpretation, the Committee agreed that this was not a factor which it would take into account. 23 There was also the issue of the exchange rate.  While this was little changed from its level at the time of the previous meeting, its strength against the euro continued to surprise many observers. But the reaction of sterling to any change in UK interest rates was unclear. The immediate policy decision 24 Over the past month, there had been further revisions to the level and composition of GDP, a continuing recovery in survey data from the low points reached in the latter part of 1998, and some easing in labour market pressures, including lower settlements and earnings growth.  This was against the backdrop of a world economy in which some of the downside risks had diminished, oil prices had risen sharply, and the exchange rate was over 2% higher than assumed in the February Inflation Report. 25 Given this background the Committee discussed the case for no change to rates, a reduction of 25 basis points, and a reduction of 50 basis points.  Monetary Policy Committee 75 26 The Committee considered various developments which could have suggested leaving rates unchanged this month.  The prospects for activity were much as expected, with some signs that past reductions in interest rates were beginning to sustain activity. The changes to the composition of demand were at least as important as the downwards revision to GDP, and suggested that the downside risks to output from a stock cycle or weak investment during 1999 were less now than previously thought.  Financial wealth had risen, with share prices up further during the month and the housing market showing signs of recovery.  Survey measures of confidence had also recovered somewhat.  Overall, the evidence appeared consistent with positive, if slow, growth in GDP during the rest of this year, as set out in the central projection of the February Inflation Report.  And while there were signs that labour market pressures had begun to ease, the evidence was not conclusive (for example on earnings per hour) and the link between this and prices required further analysis.  Finally, oil prices were sharply higher. 27 But other developments pointed to the need for a further reduction in interest rates.  The effective exchange rate had been stronger throughout most of the previous month.  Earnings growth seemed to be lower than expected, a view supported by information on settlements, although assessing the implications of this for prices required more work.  Finally, confidence, although improved, probably remained fragile.  With a reduction in interest rates widely expected a decision to maintain rates at their current levels could be seen as a policy tightening, which might have an unnecessarily damaging effect on confidence and activity. 28 The previous month several members had felt that not much additional news would be required to justify a further reduction in rates.  They took the view that the balance of evidence since then supported a reduction in interest rates this month.  While the prospects for activity were little changed over the month, the risks to the inflation outlook had shifted somewhat to the downside.  It was therefore appropriate to reduce rates by 25 basis points in order to meet the inflation target. 29 Another view which favoured an immediate reduction in the repo rate of 25 basis points was that there was a growing risk that the inflation target would be undershot, given the lags between output and inflation, the intensity of price competition from overseas and the deceleration seen in settlements and earnings. Short-term inflation expectations as measured by surveys had declined, and might fall further given the sharp decline in the RPI measure of inflation.  The size of the PNFC deficit was a concern, and the growth in investment might well be a temporary  pre-millennium effect.  Finally, the intensifying Balkans conflict increased the downside risks of a further blow to confidence in the global economy.  It was therefore necessary to keep interest rates on a downwards path, and a reduction in rates of 25 basis points this month was appropriate. 30 Another view was that in March, a reduction of 40 basis points had been required.  Since then the revisions to GDP had contained little news, although given the underspend in 1998, it was possible that government final demand might increase by less than planned.  With price developments favourable, and the future earnings profile likely to be below that contained in the February Inflation Report, it was preferable to reduce the repo rate by 50 basis points now, in order to prevent inflation falling below the target and to underpin activity. 31 The Governor invited members of the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate be reduced by 25 basis points to 5.25%.  Eight members of the Committee (the Governor, Mervyn King, David Clementi, Alan Budd, Charles Goodhart, DeAnne Julius, Ian Plenderleith and John Vickers) voted for the proposition.  Willem Buiter voted against, preferring a reduction of 50 basis points. 32 The following members of the Committee were present. Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Alan Budd Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers 33 Andrew Turnbull was present as the Treasury representative.  Inflation Report:  May 1999 76 1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by the Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee on 1 April, in advance of its meeting on 7–8 April 1999.  At the start of the Committee meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and that information is included in the Annex. I The international economy 2 In the United States the final estimate of GDP in 1998 Q4 had been 1.5%, in line with the preliminary estimate.  Some special factors which may have supported robust growth in Q4, such as the seasonality of trade data, had possibly begun to unwind in Q1.  The trade deficit had widened to $17.0 billion in January from $14.1 billion in December.  However, other factors supporting rapid growth in Q4 had persisted in early 1999.  The outlook for consumption had been little changed:  retail sales growth had remained rapid in the first two months of the year and consumer confidence had risen again in March.  The NAPM index of industrial sentiment had risen further in March.  The sharpness of the rise in the NAPM index in recent months had suggested at least that the slowdown in industrial production growth might have bottomed out.  Employment growth had been strong in February, but had weakened in March.  This month-to-month volatility may have reflected some weather-related erratic influences.  The unemployment rate had fallen to 4.2% in March.  Annual growth in average hourly earnings had continued to ease, falling to 3.6% in March, and consumer price inflation had remained muted.  Since the March MPC meeting, market expectations of interest rates in the United States had declined, while equity prices in mid-1999 were expected by the market to be slightly higher. 3 Within the euro area, Italian GDP had declined by 0.3% in 1998 Q4.  This decline had been exaggerated by the smaller number of working days in the quarter compared with Q3, though the data had still revealed unexpected weakness in domestic demand growth.  In the euro area as a whole, industrial sentiment had weakened slightly in February.  The western German Ifo index had fallen in February to its lowest level since August 1996.  Yet consumer confidence had remained buoyant.  French retail sales had fallen in February but underlying growth had remained robust. The three-month centred moving average of annual broad money growth in the euro area had risen to 5.1% in January from 4.9% in December.  Monthly data showed that year on year growth had slowed to 5.2% in February from 5.6% in January, partly reflecting weaker growth of overnight deposits.  Annual growth in the  euro-area HICP had remained at 0.8% in February, and there had been little sign of inflationary pressure from intermediate prices. Since the previous MPC meeting, the euro had depreciated against the dollar and market expectations of short-term interest rates had declined.  In its spring forecast, the European Commission had revised down its projections for GDP growth in the euro area in 1999 and 2000, to 2.2% and 2.7% respectively. 4 Japanese GDP had fallen by 0.8% in 1998 Q4.  There had been evidence of earlier fiscal stimulus in the data on government investment, which had contributed 0.9 percentage points to growth in that quarter.  But all other major components of GDP had remained weak in Q4.  In February, the unemployment rate had risen to a record high of 4.6% and inactivity had increased. Employment had continued to fall.  In February, personal incomes had continued to decline.  Real consumption had fallen by 3.8% in the year to February.  The March Tankan survey of industrial sentiment had recorded a slight improvement in business confidence, owing primarily to an easing of financial conditions. But other indicators within the Tankan had remained weak.  Since the March MPC meeting, ten-year government bond yields had continued to fall, by around 25 basis points.  Market expectations of Japanese short-term interest rates had remained relatively stable, as had the yen. 5 Spreads on government bonds in emerging markets over  US Treasuries had narrowed over the month, although they remained higher in Latin America than in Asian countries. Agreement on a new IMF financial package for Brazil had been reflected in the appreciation of the Brazilian real since the previous MPC meeting.  But available data for the first two months of this year had shown that capital flows to emerging markets were unlikely to be markedly larger in Q1 than in Q4.  II Monetary and financial conditions 6 Growth of notes and coin had remained stable in March. After adjusting for the effects of the new 50 pence and £2 coins, the one-month growth rate had remained at 0.5%, as in January and February.  The annualised three-month growth rate had fallen to 6.0% in March from 6.9% in February. 7 The stock of M4 had increased by £4.2 billion in February compared with £1.2 billion in January.  The February figure included a £3.9 billion rise in repos (not seasonally adjusted).  The slowdown in annual M4 growth had continued in February:  the twelve-month growth rate of M4 had fallen to 7.4%, from 7.7% in January. 8 The growth of M4 lending had been relatively weak in February at £3.6 billion, despite strong reverse repo activity, partly reflecting a substantial securitisation.  The twelve-month growth rate of M4 lending had been 6.9% in February compared with 7.8% in January (after adjustment for the securitisation, the twelve-month growth rate was 7.1%).  This slowdown had partly reflected strong February 1998 figures dropping out of the calculation.  9 Private non-financial corporations’ (PNFCs’) holdings of M4 had grown by 1.6% in February.  The strong flow had been distorted by the proceeds of a large corporate debt issue being held on deposit.  Excluding the estimated effects of this issue, the twelve-month growth rate had risen to 6.2% in February from 5.8% in January.  When adjusted in the same way, the three and  six-month growth rates in February had fallen below their rates in January.  M4 lending to PNFCs had fallen by £0.2 billion in February.  Analysis by Bank staff had suggested that the coincident pick-up in the growth of PNFCs’ M4 lending and slowdown in M4 deposits over the previous six months might have been due to the strength of business investment in 1998 H2.  The same analysis had indicated that the current level of PNFCs’ M4 deposits and lending might suggest that business investment would remain relatively robust this year. 10 Households’ holdings of M4 had increased by £2.0 billion in February, compared with an increase of £1.9 billion in January. The weak figure for January had been attributed, in part, to the effects of concentrated income tax payments following the introduction of self-assessment.  While it was possible that these effects had also been present in the February data, the new information might imply a more general slowdown.  Households’ M4 borrowing had remained steady at £3.2 billion in February. Total lending to individuals had increased by 0.6% in February, much the same as the average since February 1998.  Within individuals’ lending, secured lending had increased by 0.5% in February.  Again this was broadly in line with one-month  changes since February 1998.  But the one-month growth rate  Annex:  Summary of data presented by Bank staff  Monetary Policy Committee 77 of unsecured lending had fallen from 1.3% in January to 0.9% in February. 11 The stock of M4 held by other financial corporations (OFCs) had increased by £0.3 billion in February compared with a fall of £1.8 billion in January.  The twelve-month growth rate in OFCs’ M4 had fallen to its lowest level since 1995 Q1.  M4 lending to OFCs had increased to £1.7 billion in February from £0.3 billion in January. 12 Turning to price indicators of monetary conditions, sterling interest rate expectations had fallen since the March MPC decision. Short-term interest rates had implied that financial market participants expected the repo rate to fall to around 5% during 1999.  Longer-term nominal interest rates had also fallen:   three-year forward rates had fallen by around 20 basis points since the March MPC meeting.  The falls had been concentrated at the short end of the yield curve. 13 Measures of short-term inflation expectations from monthly surveys had remained broadly unchanged at 2.2% to 2.3%. Measures of two-year inflation expectations from quarterly surveys had shown falls for almost all groups surveyed:  for example, the Barclays Basix survey had reported that trade unions’ average RPI inflation expectations for the next two years had fallen by 40 basis points since the 1998 Q4 survey.  Inflation forward rates, derived from index-linked bond yields, had shown little change since the March MPC meeting.  Since the February Inflation Report, however, inflation forward rates at all maturities had risen from a range of 2.5% to 2.9% to around 3%.  One explanation offered by Bank staff was that nominal yields may have been artificially depressed earlier this year as a result of institutional investors’ demand to hold liquid instruments. 14 The FT-SE 100 index had risen by 6.8% since the March MPC meeting.  Implied volatility had fallen further, and to below the levels seen before the Russian debt crisis.  The FT-SE SmallCap index had risen more than the rest of the market, reflecting in part the strength of the General industrials sector over the period.  The Resources sector had also performed very strongly alongside the rise in oil prices. 15 The effective exchange rate had fallen in recent days, after an earlier appreciation, to stand 0.3% lower than at the March MPC meeting.  Sterling had changed little against the euro and had depreciated slightly against the US dollar.  III The Budget 16 Staff presented a short summary of the Chancellor’s recent Budget.  HM Treasury’s forecast of PSNB (including the windfall tax) for 1998/99 had been revised up slightly.  Lower receipts had more than off-set lower spending.  The Budget had announced measures that would increase borrowing by £1 billion in 1999/00, £1.4 billion in 2000/01 and £3.6 billion in 2001/02.  However,  other changes to HM Treasury’s forecasts for spending and receipts over these years had led to lower projected borrowing over the same period.  Lower forecasts for social security payments and  debt interest payments had more than offset lower projected receipts. 17 Overall, the outlook for the fiscal stance was little changed since the Pre-Budget Report:  a small deficit had still been projected in 1999/00 and 2000/01 but this was cyclical in nature; the structural deficit had been projected to be broadly balanced. The ‘Golden Rule’ was expected to be met with a small margin of safety over the next three years.  The net debt to GDP ratio had been projected to fall well below 40% by 2001/02. 18 The Budget measures had been aimed at targeting help on families with children, improving work incentives and promoting enterprise through microeconomic reform.  These had included reductions in personal income tax rates;  changes to National Insurance contributions;  measures to reduce taxation for  small businesses;  and the introduction of a Children’s Tax  Credit along with increases in existing benefits to families with children. IV Demand and output 19 The 1998 Q4 National Accounts release had included revisions back to 1997 Q1.  The level of GDP at constant market prices in 1998 Q4 had been 0.3 percentage points lower than the February estimate, and 0.5 percentage points lower than the preliminary estimate.  Revisions to GDP at constant basic prices had been more limited.  Downward revisions to the level of the income and output based measures of GDP had reduced the shortfall of expenditure relative to the average measure.  In 1998 as a whole, GDP had grown by 2.1% (revised from 2.3%) compared with 3.5% (unrevised) in 1997.  The quarterly growth rate of GDP at constant market prices in Q4 had been revised down to 0.1% from 0.2%.  Within the expenditure measure of GDP, upward revisions to consumption and investment growth and the contribution of net trade had been matched by a large downward revision to changes in inventories. 20 Household spending growth in Q4 had been revised up to 0.6% from 0.4%, following an outturn of 0.1% in Q3.  Spending on vehicles and energy had been particularly volatile in Q3 and Q4. Household spending growth had slowed overall in 1998:  the annualised rate of growth had eased to 1.2% in 1998 H2 from 3.0% in H1.  Despite strong consumption growth, the household saving ratio in Q4 had risen to 7.4% from 6.3%.  This had reflected a sharp decline in tax payments which had led to an increase of 1.8% in post-tax income.  Compensation of employees had risen by 1.5% in nominal terms in Q4.  The erratic path of tax payments and household income during 1998 had partly been related to the introduction of self-assessment.  The level of tax payments made by households had risen sharply in 1998 by 17%, leading to virtually no growth in real post-tax household income. 21 Whole economy investment growth in Q4 had been revised upwards to 2.9% from 2.0%.  Business investment had grown by 5.5%.  The ratio of business investment to GDP had increased sharply in recent years—in line with the ratio in the US—to exceed its previous peak in 1989 Q3.  But the increase in the capital stock to output ratio had been more moderate.  In both the UK and the US part of the recent strength in business investment was due to IT spending. 22 Changes in inventories in Q4 had been revised downwards to £0.9 billion from £1.9 billion.  If alignment adjustments are excluded, stockbuilding had increased by less in Q4 than in Q3. The revisions had been concentrated in ‘other industries’ and manufacturing.  Manufacturers and retailers had destocked in Q4, consistent with earlier survey evidence.  But lower stockbuilding had been to some extent offset by a downward revision to output so that the stock-output ratio had been little changed.  The March CBI monthly Industrial Trends survey had continued to indicate that stocks were more than adequate:  the balance had been +20, above its average of +13 since 1985. 23 The contribution of net trade to GDP growth in Q4 had been revised to -0.9 percentage points from -1.1 as a result of upward revisions to exports and imports.  The level of exports and, to a larger extent, imports back to 1997 Q1 had also been revised upwards.  The revisions to imports had helped to reduce the puzzle about their relative weakness following sterling’s appreciation. Monthly trade data for January had shown a sharp decline in exports to EU and non-EU countries (of 3.3% and 6.7%) and a continued rise in imports.  Though the decline in exports to non-EU countries had unwound in February, overall these data had suggested another negative net trade contribution to GDP growth in 1999 Q1.  Inflation Report:  May 1999 78 24 Service sector output growth in Q4 had been revised down to 0.5% from 0.6%.  Manufacturing output had declined by an unrevised 1.3% in Q4.  Construction output growth had been revised up to 0.1%.  On the income side of the accounts, the main news had been the decline in financial company profits in Q4. 25 Retail sales volumes had declined by 0.3% in February, following January’s strong rise.  Though the three month annual growth rate declined further to 1.0%, the CBI Distributive Trades survey had suggested that the decline in sales volumes growth might have reached a trough.  The balance on reported sales in March had risen to +14—the highest since September 1998—and the orders balance had risen for the second month running.   New car registrations had fallen sharply in January and February relative to a year ago, but had been difficult to interpret because of changing seasonal patterns following the change in registration practices. 26 Industrial production had declined by 0.5% in January— because of a sharp fall in output in the energy extraction and supply industries—but had risen by 0.1% in February because of a rise in energy-related output.  Manufacturing output had shown a small increase of 0.1% in January, following five successive monthly declines, but had fallen by 0.1% in February.  Growth in industrial production over the three months to February compared with the previous three months had been -1.0% (-0.9% in January);  and for manufacturing output it had been -0.8% (-1.0% in January).  The CBI and CIPS surveys had indicated another decline in manufacturing output in 1999 Q1, though it appeared that this would be less than in 1998 Q4. 27 The CIPS Report on Services had reported a rise in all indices in March:  the output index had risen from 49.5 to 53, the first positive reading since October 1998;  the incoming new business index had also risen above 50 to 53.9, the highest level since June 1998 and above the average for 1998 as whole;  and the business expectations index had risen to 76.4 from 72.1 in February. 28 The Nationwide house price index had increased by 1.5% in March—the largest monthly rise since June 1997—and had been 7.6% higher than a year earlier;  the Halifax index had increased by 1.2% in March and had been 4.5% higher than a year earlier.  The RICS survey had suggested price rises across all regions in February.  The HBF survey balances on site visitors and net reservations had continued to indicate an increase in housing transactions in coming months.  Particulars delivered had increased for a third consecutive month, to stand 4.5% higher in the three months to February compared with the previous three months.  The GfK consumer confidence indicator had risen for the third month running. V Labour market 29 LFS employment had grown by 119,000 (0.4%) in the three months to January, compared with the previous three months, somewhat stronger than the Workforce Jobs figure of 69,000 in the three months to December.  The difference between the two measures, probably due to timing and the coverage of the surveys, was accounted for by the larger rise in employees in the LFS, driven by a large increase in part-time jobs.  Total hours worked had fallen by 0.2% in the three months to January, and average hours per worker had been 0.7% lower.  The fall in average hours worked had reflected the large rise in part-time employment and a 0.7% fall in average hours worked by full-time workers, consistent with a reduction in overtime working.  30 The strong increases in employment had contrasted with survey evidence.  The CIPS surveys for March had suggested that employment was continuing to fall in the manufacturing and construction sectors, though there had been a small increase in employment in the service sector.  Forward-looking surveys had suggested that this pattern might persist.  The Manpower survey for Q1 had shown the weakest job prospects since 1993, for the second quarter in succession.  The outlook in manufacturing had worsened, while employment intentions in the service sector had been little changed.  31 The stock of unfilled job-centre vacancies had edged down by 3,500 in February and the number of jobs advertised in national newspapers had fallen, according to the Press Recruitment Advertising Index.  But the number of permanent placements by job agencies had increased in March for the first time in six months, according to the FRES survey on the demand for staff. 32 LFS unemployment had risen by 37,000 in the three months to January, taking the rate to 6.3%.  This had been the first rise in the rate, in non-overlapping periods, since early 1993.  The number of people unemployed for more than one year had fallen by 17,000 in the three months to January, offset by a rise in short-term unemployment.  Claimant unemployment had risen by 4,300, but the rate had remained unchanged at 4.6%.  Inflows into unemployment had been broadly flat, and the exit rate from unemployment had fallen, but remained at a high level.  The rise in employment had been associated with a fall in inactivity of 117,000.  In net terms, all of the rise in employment had been concentrated among workers more than 25 years old, which had been roughly matched by falls in inactivity. 33 Headline whole-economy annual average earnings growth had fallen to 4.3% in December, reflecting a decline in the growth of irregular pay.  The slowdown in headline earnings growth since the peak in May had been sharp, but this measure referred to growth in earnings per head.  It was likely that the growth in earnings per hour had fallen less rapidly, reflecting the reduction in average hours worked over this period.  The Reward index of annual earnings growth had continued to fall, from a peak of 5.4% in June 1998 to 4.5% in February.  The growth of wages and salaries had been broadly flat since mid-1997.  The rise in 1998 Q4, which had contrasted with the fall in growth measured by the Average Earnings Index over the same period, could be explained by volatility in pension contributions and balancing adjustments between different measures of GDP.  34 The Bank’s employment-weighted twelve-month measure of whole economy settlements had remained at 3.7% in February, but the three-month measure had fallen by 0.3 percentage points to 3.3%.  In a matched sample of firms from the Bank’s settlements database, mean settlements in January and February had fallen to 3.3% in 1999, from 4% in 1998.  The proportion of employees in this sample who had received a lower settlement in 1999 had been 78%.  The three-month measure from Industrial Relations Services had also fallen in February. 35 Annual productivity growth had fallen from 1.1% in Q3  to 0.7% in Q4, the lowest rate since 1991.  The revisions to Workforce Jobs, announced in December, had caused a generally downward revision to productivity growth.  Because the growth of wages and salaries per head had increased and productivity growth had fallen in Q4, the growth of unit wage costs had continued to rise. 36 The Bank’s regional Agents had conducted a survey of their contacts about employment prospects and the adequacy and quality of their labour force.  They had asked whether contacts had expected employment to change over the next 6 months:  36% of respondents had reported that the level of employment was expected to be unchanged, whereas the number of companies who had been planning to increase staff had been the same as the number planning to shed labour (32% each).  Over 50% of manufacturers had reported that employment levels were expected to be lower whereas in the service sector over 40% of respondents expected higher employment.  There had also been some differences across regions, but most had presented a picture consistent with the overall results.  Monetary Policy Committee 79 37 The Agents had also asked about the adequacy of the existing labour force in relation to current output.  About 30% of respondents had reported that their current employment was more than adequate, whereas less than 20% had reported that their labour force was less than adequate.  In manufacturing, there had been many more firms who had reported that they were over-staffed than under-staffed, whereas in the service sector, there had been slightly more firms reporting an under-resourced rather than over-resourced labour force.  Some contacts had been recruiting staff even if their existing workforce had been more than adequate, either because they were expecting a significant upturn in demand conditions or because they had been recruiting different types of staff, perhaps with specialist skills. 38 The Agents also asked whether the quality of recruits had changed in the last 12 months.  Around two-thirds of their contacts had reported that the quality of recruits had been the same recently. There had been little evidence of lower quality recruits overall. However, in the service sector, especially retail, there had been more dissatisfaction with the recent quality of recruits than in manufacturing. VI Prices 39 Oil prices had risen by over 20% in March in response to an agreement to new OPEC production cuts.  The effect on RPIX inflation and GDP if oil prices were to remain at these levels was likely to be limited.  The Bank’s index of commodity prices excluding oil had fallen by 0.4% in February, and 1.2% including oil prices.  The trend in both measures had continued to be one of moderating deflation.  The measures to reform the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which had been agreed at the Berlin summit in March, included smaller and later price cuts than in the original proposals.  The 0.3% (upper-limit) effect on the RPI which had been estimated by MAFF on the basis of the original proposals was likely to be smaller in light of the agreement.  Producer price inflation had remained weak in February:  input prices fell by 0.1%—as in January, the movement had been largely accounted  for by the oil price (10% of the index);  output prices excluding excise duties had risen by 0.2%, to a level 0.6% lower than a year earlier.  The CIPS and CBI surveys had continued to suggest further falls.  40 Import prices had fallen by 0.6% in January whereas export prices had risen by 0.6%.  The difference between the annual rates of export and import price inflation had reached 1.5 percentage points in January, the largest difference since June 1997—though both had remained sharply negative (imports -4.9%, exports -3.4%). The GDP (market prices) deflator in the year to the fourth quarter of 1998 had grown by 2.6%, revised down from 2.8%.  The equivalent measure for the implied household consumption deflator had been revised up by 0.4 percentage points to 2.3%—close to the annual rate of RPIX inflation in the fourth quarter (2.5%).  The unit labour costs based measure of domestically generated inflation had become available again, and had continued to rise in the fourth quarter of 1998.   41 RPIX inflation had fallen by 0.2 percentage points to 2.4% in February;  both RPIY and RPI inflation had also fallen, to 1.8% and 2.1% respectively.  The fall had been largely due to goods price inflation falling by 0.3 percentage points to 1.1%.  The HICP inflation rate had also fallen, by 0.1 percentage points to 1.5%, for the same reasons as RPIX.  Annual RPIX inflation was likely to increase temporarily in March—largely due to the difference of timing of the budgets in 1998 and 1999—and fall in April. VII Reports by the Bank’s Agents 42 The Agents had reported on their general discussions with contacts.  Firms in the service sector had tended to report slower growth.  But conditions had remained fairly positive overall, particularly in leisure, finance and business services.  Growth in the retail sector had continued to be relatively weak, though there had been an increasing polarisation in performance between stores reporting quite strong growth and those reporting no growth or even falling sales volumes.  Service firms with an exposure to the manufacturing sector—such as road hauliers—had  experienced adverse trading conditions.  But Agents had felt that the rate of deterioration in manufacturing activity may have eased.  Stock corrections that had started in 1998 Q4 had largely been completed. But competition in the domestic market from imports had been increasing, particularly from European-based firms as European markets had remained relatively weak.  The exchange rate had remained a concern for UK exporters and was considered an obstacle to recovery.  Demand from the United States had continued to be strong and some East Asian markets had seen a rise in trade enquiries.  43 Construction sector activity had remained buoyant and this was expected to continue into next year.  Housing market activity had shown signs of improvement although it had remained fairly subdued in many areas.  But there was less construction work available beyond mid-2000.  Firms had suggested that public sector work was likely to be an important factor next year.  The outlook for investment more generally had remained positive, though still cautious, and the focus of spending had continued to be on improved efficiency and product development.  Investment in some sectors—such as oil and steel—had been reduced or moved overseas. 44 The service sector had continued to be the main provider of new jobs, though tighter control on numbers and increased flexibility had been evident.  More firms had been introducing annualised hours contracts and making more use of part-time and temporary contract staff.  There had been evidence that some firms were reluctant to shed staff as demand slowed because of likely recruitment difficulties in any upturn.  Natural wastage had been employed to reduce staff  numbers by small amounts.  Pay awards had moderated in both the manufacturing and service sectors, more so in manufacturing where there had also been a rise in the number of zero or deferred awards. VIII Market intelligence 45 There had been a broad market consensus that interest rates would be lowered in April, based on the improving inflation picture, with some also expecting an ECB rate cut.  Survey and asset price evidence had suggested a wider divergence of views on UK rates over the next year or two, based on alternative forecasts for growth and inflation up to 2000.  Long-term rates had fallen slightly over the past month.  Sterling had appreciated during 1999 versus the euro, and had appeared little affected by domestic factors in the month.  Some of the factors influencing sterling—such as demand related to merger and acquisition business—were thought to have been temporary, and there had been some evidence that the market saw downside risks over the next year.   Inflation Report:  May 1999 80 Text of Bank of England press notice of 8 April 1999 Bank of England reduces interest rates by 0.25% to 5.25% The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee today voted to reduce the Bank’s repo rate by 0.25% to 5.25%. The minutes of the meeting will be published at 9.30 am on Wednesday 21 April.  Monetary Policy Committee 81 The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee today voted to maintain the Bank’s repo rate at 5.25%. The Committee considered how policy should be set in the light of its latest inflation projection.  Since the February Inflation Report, there have been encouraging signs of recovering growth, and over the forecast period inflation is expected to be broadly in line with the 21/2% target. The projection takes account of the rise since February in sterling’s effective exchange rate, and assumes a decline from its present high level, at least in line with interest rate differentials.  If sterling were not to weaken as assumed, it is likely that inflation would undershoot the inflation target over the coming two years.  In those circumstances, depending on other developments in the economy, there might, therefore, need to be further easing of interest rates in order to keep inflation on track to meet the 21/2% target. The latest projections and analysis will appear in the Inflation Report to be published on Wednesday 12 May.   The minutes of the meeting will be published at 9.30 am on Wednesday 19 May.

1999-08-11,"Inflation Report August 1999 The Inflation Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff  under the guidance of the members of the Monetary  Policy Committee.  It serves two purposes.  First,  its preparation provides a comprehensive and  forward-looking framework for discussion among MPC  members as an aid to our decision making.  Second, its  publication allows us to share our thinking and explain  the reasons for our decisions to those whom they affect. Although not every member will agree with every  assumption on which our projections are based, the fan  charts represent the MPC’s best collective judgment  about the most likely path for inflation and output, and the  uncertainties surrounding those central projections. This Report has been prepared and published by the  Bank of England in accordance with section 18 of the  Bank of England Act 1998.

Over the past year, robust domestic demand—especially household consumption and business investment—has sustained annual GDP growth above 1%, despite the sharp deterioration in the trade position caused by the strength of sterling and global economic weakness. Those external factors have helped to subdue inflation, and domestic cost and price pressures have eased too.  In particular, rising employment has been accompanied by declining nominal pay growth. Prospects for the world economy have continued to improve since the May Report.  Activity in the United States remains buoyant, but growth may be starting to ease and interest rates have risen.  There are signs of a pick-up in the euro area, including some recovery in business confidence.  In Japan, strong growth was recorded in the first quarter, but sustained recovery of private domestic demand is not yet evident.  Prospects for many, but not all, emerging market economies in Asia and Latin America have also brightened.  The period of falling world prices may be coming to an end as activity recovers, and the oil price has risen sharply in recent months.  But risks to the global economic outlook remain.  Trade imbalances have widened further, and demand might be vulnerable to a fall in asset prices. Apart from two virtually flat quarters around the turn of the year, UK output is now estimated to have increased by 0.5% per quarter—close to the trend growth rate— from late 1997 to the second quarter of this year.  Over that period manufacturing output has declined while service sector growth has been strong.  In recent months, however, there are signs of some recovery in manufacturing activity. The domestic and external components of demand remain in sharp contrast.  Final domestic demand—ie excluding inventory investment—was 3.7% higher in 1999 Q1 than a year earlier.  Household consumption  ii Inflation Report:  August 1999 and business investment, both of which are now estimated to have been stronger than previously thought, grew by 3.3% and 11% respectively.  Inventory investment contributed negatively to overall demand growth as stock build-ups were corrected, especially in the winter quarters of flat output.  And net trade— exports less imports—made a negative contribution to growth of 2.3 percentage points.  Survey indicators point to strengthening activity. Consistent with the recent profile of output growth, business expectations and consumer confidence measures, which fell steeply in the autumn, have now recovered uniformly to their levels before the international economic turbulence of last year.  The Bank’s regional Agents also report that sentiment is improving, though perhaps less robustly than survey measures might suggest, and with significant sectoral and regional variation. Narrow money holdings have accelerated in recent months, but broad money growth has eased, largely on account of movements in financial company deposits. Credit growth—especially secured lending to households—has been buoyant, and the housing market has picked up, sharply in some areas.  The official interest rate was reduced by 0.25% to 5% in June, but money-market interest rates over the short to medium term have risen steeply since the May Report. Despite the slowdown in activity, employment has continued to rise, though modestly in recent months. The latest revisions to the National Accounts have increased measured productivity growth over the past year.  However—in contrast to the United States—UK productivity growth has been below trend since the  mid 1990s, but is expected to pick up.  Unemployment has declined further—to 6.2% on the Labour Force Survey measure, and to 4.4% on the claimant count, the lowest level since 1980.  The available evidence on vacancies, employment intentions, and skill shortages suggests that the labour market overall is tight but steady.   Nominal pay growth—an important indicator of domestic inflationary pressure—has eased further.  The annual growth rate of earnings per worker as measured by the Average Earnings Index declined to 4.3% in the three months to May, during which time the National Minimum Wage came into effect.  Public sector pay growth has risen, but private sector earnings growth has  iii Overview declined markedly.  Overall, recent wage settlements are on average about half a percentage point lower than a year ago.  Inflation expectations and average hours worked have fallen substantially over the same period, so the underlying trend in real earnings growth is less clear.  Nevertheless, pay pressures have been weaker than expected in relation to employment and output. The exchange rate is a key determinant of import price inflation.  Sterling strengthened further in May.  This, together with evidence of softening pay and price pressures, led the Monetary Policy Committee to reduce the official interest rate at its June meeting.  Sterling eased somewhat in July, and the starting-point for the exchange rate in the MPC’s current projections is slightly below the central path assumed in the May Report. The MPC’s current projection for the annual growth rate of GDP—based on the assumption that the official interest rate remains constant at 5%—is shown in  Chart 1.  The profile is stronger than the May projection. First, data revisions have increased estimated growth over the past year, so that the current growth rate is above 1% rather than below.  Second, growth prospects are judged to have strengthened in view of the improved outlook for consumer expenditure, the housing market, inventory investment and the international environment. In the central projection, annual growth rises to around 3% in 2001. The Committee’s best collective judgment of the prospects for RPIX inflation is shown in Chart 2.  The most likely outcome is for inflation to decline from its present level of 2.2% to below 2% over the next year or so, before rising slightly above target by the end of the two-year forecast period.  The balance of risks around this central projection is slightly on the upside. There is considerable uncertainty about the inflation outlook, and not all Committee members share the judgment about inflation prospects shown in Chart 2.  In particular, some Committee members prefer to base their central projection on an assumption that the nominal exchange rate stays constant, rather than declining on account of interest rate differentials.  This lowers the inflation profile—by around 0.4 percentage points at the two-year horizon—and slightly weakens the growth profile.  Some of these Committee members judge, moreover, that there are further downside risks to inflation from the possibility of lower profit margins or Chart 2 Current RPIX inflation projection based on constant nominal interest rates at 5.0% 1995 96 97 98 99 2000 01 0 1 2 3 4 5 2.5 Percentage increase in prices on a year earlier The fan chart depicting the probability distribution for inflation is rather  like a contour map.

However, these might be offset, at least in part, by greater upside risks from oil prices. Some other Committee members take the view that pay pressures are likely to be somewhat stronger than reflected in the projection in Chart 2.  This raises the inflation profile—by about 0.2 percentage points at the two-year horizon—but has little effect on the profile for GDP growth.   Weak world prices and the strong pound have helped to subdue inflation over the past two years.  Domestic inflationary pressure has eased as well, to an unexpected degree in relation to activity and employment, and inflation expectations have fallen substantially—to around the 21/2% target level.  The immediate outlook is for growth with low inflation.  The future relationship between output growth and inflation is less clear.  Given these uncertainties, the Monetary Policy Committee will pay close attention to emerging evidence on the links between activity, costs and prices, and the implications for the future path of inflation in relation to the target.

The MPC voted to cut the Bank’s repo rate by  0.25 percentage points to 5% on 10 June.  At its meetings in July and August, the MPC voted to maintain the rate at that level.  On 30 June, the US Federal Open Market Committee voted to raise the federal funds target rate by 0.25 percentage points to 5%, the first increase for two years.  Since the May Report, financial markets’ short-term interest rate expectations have risen in the United Kingdom, the United States and the euro area. The sterling exchange rate depreciated by 1.3% on a trade-weighted basis between 5 May and 4 August. Equity prices have fallen slightly in the United Kingdom, the United States and the euro area since the May Report, but have risen strongly in Japan.  UK house price inflation has picked up, and there is some indication of higher growth in commercial property prices. Growth in notes and coin rose strongly in the second quarter of 1999, and reached its highest annual rate in July since November 1996.  Although broad money growth has continued to slow, this is primarily owing to a contraction in the deposits of non-bank financial corporations.  The broad money holdings of households and non-financial corporations have been a little more robust, which seems consistent with the recent stronger evidence on domestic demand.  Growth in secured lending to individuals in the second quarter was high by recent historical standards, in line with greater housing market activity. 1.1 Money and credit Narrow money The value of notes and coin in circulation grew at an annualised rate of 8.8% in the three months to July (see Table 1.A), and the twelve-month growth rate rose to 7.3% (see Chart 1.1).(1) Some of this increase in growth is likely to reflect reductions in interest rates, which have lowered the opportunity cost of holding cash.  But stronger growth in notes and coin is also consistent with (1) After adjustment for the combined effect of the new £2 and 50 pence coins, the annual growth rate of notes and coin is estimated to have risen from 5.8% in April to 7.4% in July.

Broad money The annual rate of growth of M4 fell by 1.3 percentage points in the second quarter of 1999 to 5.6%, its sixth consecutive quarterly fall (see Chart 1.2).  M4 lending, which measures bank and building society lending to  the rest of the private sector, grew by 7.6% in the year  to Q2, 0.4 percentage points higher than in the first quarter. The relationship between M4 and aggregate spending is complicated by the fact that some M4 deposits are held as savings rather than for conducting transactions.  An alternative indicator is broad Divisia money, which is a weighted sum of M4 components designed to reflect better the transactions motive for holding deposits.  The amount of transactions services that a deposit provides is assumed to be inversely related to the associated interest rate.  So the higher the deposit rate, the more illiquid that deposit is assumed to be;  and the weight given to the deposit in the Divisia index is correspondingly lower. Divisia money growth was little changed in the second quarter at 7.0%, but was higher than M4 growth. The profile of aggregate M4 since 1995 has been driven primarily by other financial corporations (OFCs) (see Chart 1.3), which are non-bank financial intermediaries such as insurance companies, pension funds, unit trusts and securities and derivatives dealers.  Their money holdings are motivated more by portfolio considerations than by spending on goods and services.  This makes it particularly hard to draw implications about nominal demand from aggregate broad money growth.  But annual growth in households’ and private non-financial corporations’ (PNFCs’) deposits rose in the first half of 1999, and this seems more consistent with other evidence of a pick-up in domestic spending. Household sector Annual growth in households’ M4 deposits was 6.8% in the second quarter, 0.5 percentage points higher than in 1999 Q1.  Total net lending to individuals (ie households excluding non profit making institutions and unincorporated businesses), which includes lending by institutions other than banks and building societies,  grew by 8.1% in the year to 1999 Q2, its highest rate of growth since the fourth quarter of 1991 (see Chart 1.4).

Money and financial markets 5 Lending secured on dwellings accounts for around 80% of the stock of total lending to individuals.  Secured lending has picked up strongly, growing by 6.8% on a year earlier in 1999 Q2, its highest rate of growth since the second quarter of 1992.  And the value of loan approvals for house purchase rose sharply in March and has remained high.  To the extent that these housing transactions are completed, the outlook for future secured lending remains robust. As well as borrowing for house purchase, secured borrowing includes mortgage equity withdrawal (MEW), eg where a household releases a portion of its housing equity by increasing its existing mortgage.  Mortgage equity withdrawal may be picking up:  as a proportion of households’ post-tax income, the Bank’s estimate of MEW in the first quarter of 1999 was positive, having been negative for most of the 1990s, although the level remains low relative to the late 1980s (see Chart 1.5). Some of the mortgage equity withdrawal in the first quarter may feed through into future consumption, and continuing strength in property values could encourage further mortgage equity withdrawal. Growth in net unsecured lending remains strong in relation to nominal spending, but has been slowing in recent quarters (see Chart 1.4).  The twelve-month growth rate of unsecured lending to individuals was 14.2% in 1999 Q2, compared with the recent peak of 17.4% in the third quarter of 1998.  The fall in the growth rate may in part be the result of some households substituting unsecured borrowing with mortgage equity withdrawal. Private non-financial corporations PNFCs’ M4 deposits grew by 0.5% during the second quarter of 1999, following a very strong one-quarter growth rate of 4.5% in 1999 Q1.  So although the twelve-month growth rate fell to 7.6% in the second quarter from 9.2% in Q1, the rate is still somewhat higher than in 1998.  PNFCs’ M4 borrowing weakened slightly in the first half of the year.  But this measure captures only sterling borrowing from UK banks and building societies.  A broader measure of PNFCs’ financing, which includes foreign currency borrowing from banks and building societies and sterling and foreign currency capital market issues, grew strongly in the second quarter (see Chart 1.6).  Rising corporate borrowing may be related to stronger business investment, and possibly to greater merger and acquisitions activity.

Inflation Report:  August 1999 6 Other financial corporations (OFCs) OFCs’ deposits have contracted so far in 1999, following four years of strong growth.  The annual growth rate now stands at 1.1%, compared with 15.2% in the final quarter of 1998.  In contrast to the weakness in deposits growth, OFCs’ M4 lending picked up in the second quarter, growing by 10.3% on a year earlier, compared with 8.5% in 1999 Q1. 1.2 Interest rates and asset prices Short-term interest rates The MPC has successively reduced the Bank’s repo rate from 7.5% in October 1998 to its current level of 5%. Changes in official rates are quickly reflected in  short-term wholesale market rates, and therefore have an immediate impact on the interest income and payments of holders and issuers of short-term wholesale  money-market instruments.  Official rate changes also feed through into retail interest rates, but usually with a lag.  These lags may have lengthened recently.  Chart 1.7 shows that although the 200 basis point reduction in the Bank’s repo rate between October 1998 and March 1999 was quickly matched by reductions in retail deposit and lending rates, there has been little subsequent change in retail rates, although the repo rate was cut in April and June.  By dampening the impact of rate changes on variable retail rates, delayed pass-through may increase the lags inherent in monetary policy, or even diminish its effect. Expectations of future short-term nominal interest rates as measured by futures prices have risen since the  May Report by around 150 basis points at a two-year horizon, both in the United Kingdom and in the euro area (see Chart 1.8).  Expectations of short-term US interest rates have also risen, but by less.  Chart 1.9 shows the risk-neutral probability distribution of  three-month sterling interest rates derived from options prices on 4 August 1999.  The upward skew indicates that, in the market’s view, the balance of risks to  short-term UK interest rates over the next two years is on the upside. An important issue for monetary policy is whether higher nominal interest rates indicate a rise in the real cost of borrowing, because of higher risk-free real interest rates and/or higher inflation risk premia, or result from higher expected inflation.  But these components are not easy to measure.  The most direct measure of the Chart 1.8 Sterling and Euribor interest rate  expectations 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1996 97 98 99 2000 01 02 03 5 May 4 August Per cent 4 August 5 May Sterling Euribor Sources:  Bank of England, Bank for International Settlements and LIFFE.

The fan chart depicting the probability distribution for short-term interest  rates is rather like a contour map. At any given point, the depth of shading represents the height of the probability density function implied by the markets over a range of outcomes for short-term interest rates.  The markets judge that there is a 10% chance of interest rates being within the darkest, central band at any date.  Each successive pair of bands covers a further 10% of the probability distribution until 90% of the distribution is covered.  The bands widen as the time horizon is extended, indicating  increased uncertainty about interest rate outcomes.  Money and financial markets 7 risk-free real cost of borrowing is that derived from the prices of index-linked gilts.  The implied forward  risk-free real yield at a two-year horizon rose slightly to 1.8% on 4 August from 1.7% on 5 May.  But without a measure of the inflation risk premium the magnitude of the rise in the overall real cost of borrowing is hard to gauge. An alternative approach is to compare nominal interest rates with inflation expectations from surveys.   Table 1.B shows results from the Barclays Basix survey, which reports inflation expectations for both 12 months ahead and 12 to 24 months ahead, for five groups of professions and the general public.  Only business economists raised their 12 month ahead inflation expectations between the first and second quarters of 1999, by 10 basis points.  For 12 to 24 months ahead, higher inflation expectations in Q2 are a little more widespread, but the implication remains that much of the recent increase in short-term nominal interest rate expectations reflects higher expected real borrowing costs. Long-term interest rates Ten-year nominal spot interest rates on gilts rose by around 50 basis points to 5.2% between 5 May and  4 August.  Some of this increase reflects the higher short-term rates discussed above, but more than half of the rise is due to higher rates at the two to five-year horizon.  The rise in long-term UK interest rates may be part of a broader phenomenon:  long-term rates have been rising in the United Kingdom, United States and euro area for much of 1999 (see Chart 1.10).  Part of the reason for this may be higher global inflation expectations, as the outlook for world activity has improved and the oil price has strengthened. One channel through which higher long-term interest rates may influence domestic spending is via fixed-rate mortgages.  Banks and building societies commonly set fixed mortgage rates on the basis of the interest rate in the swap market, at which they can exchange the fixed income received on fixed-rate mortgages for  floating-rate income, in order to hedge their interest rate exposure.  Chart 1.11 shows that there is a fairly close relationship between fixed mortgage rates and swap rates.  Swap rates have risen so far in 1999 and, although fixed mortgage rates have also risen, the spread between swap rates and fixed mortgage rates is at a very low level.  It is possible therefore that fixed mortgage rates might increase further.

Inflation Report:  August 1999 8 Equity prices The FT-SE All-Share index fell by 1.4% between 5 May and 4 August, and US and European equity prices are also lower (see Chart 1.12).  But Japanese stock prices have risen strongly, reflecting an apparent improvement in the economic outlook following higher growth in Japanese output in the first quarter of this year.  The turbulence in world equity markets that followed the Russian debt crisis in August 1998 seems to have dissipated.  Uncertainty about future stock returns, as measured by implied volatilities from options prices, has fallen in all the major stock markets over the first half of 1999 (see Chart 1.13). Within the UK market, the FT-SE 100 index fell by 3% between 5 May and 4 August, compared with a 3% rise in the Mid 250 index and a 6% rise in the SmallCap index.  Insofar as larger UK stocks are more sensitive than smaller company stocks to international factors, the outperformance of smaller stocks may indicate an improvement in the outlook for the United Kingdom relative to the world economy over the past three months.  The MPC has assumed in its central projection that nominal UK equity wealth grows in line with nominal income. Property prices There are signs that house price inflation is increasing. The Halifax house price index rose by 6% in the three months to July on a seasonally adjusted basis, the highest rate since January 1989.  The annual rate of growth of the Halifax index was 8.2% in the year to  July 1999, while the Nationwide index grew by 6.9% (see Chart 1.14).  Also, the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors’ (RICS) June 1999 survey shows that 66% of chartered surveyors were reporting rising house prices over the previous three months, compared with 34% in June 1998.  House price rises in the first half of 1999 have been strongest in London and the South East (see Chart 1.15).  Although house price inflation in London and the South East led that in other UK regions in the late 1980s, evidence of a leading relationship in the 1990s is less clear. The MPC has reviewed its assumption about house price inflation.  In the past, the central assumption has been that house prices will grow in line with average earnings, so that the ratio of house prices to average earnings is constant over the MPC’s two-year forecast period.  But there have been periods in recent decades in which this ratio has risen quickly and substantially (see  Chart 1.12 Selected world share prices(a)(b) Jan. 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 Mar.

Money and financial markets 9 Chart 1.16).  The MPC has assumed in its central projection that house prices will grow at around  twice the pace of average earnings over the next two years. Evidence from a number of sources points to greater activity in the commercial property market.  First, the FTA Real Estate index has risen by 25% in 1999 compared with a 10% rise in the FT-SE All-Share index. Second, the Merrill Lynch-Gallup survey of UK fund managers has shown a positive balance in relation to UK property over the five months to July, compared with ten consecutive negative balances between May 1998 and February 1999.  Third, commercial property returns appear to be picking up.  The Investment Property Databank Ltd (IPD) calculates returns on UK commercial property on the basis of rents and changes in capital values.  Chart 1.17 shows that although  twelve-month property returns in June 1999 were  6 percentage points lower than in July 1998, three-month returns have been rising since the turn of the year, largely as a result of higher capital gains. Exchange rates The sterling effective exchange rate index (ERI) appreciated for much of the first half of 1999, peaking at 106.1 on 4 June (see Chart 1.18).  The MPC’s decision to cut the repo rate on 10 June was followed by a gradual fall in the index, and overall the ERI depreciated by 1.3% between 5 May and 4 August.  Underlying this was a 1.1% depreciation against the euro (which has a weight of 65% in the ERI).  The MPC’s assumptions regarding the path of sterling over the forecast period are discussed in Section 6. 1.3 Summary Growth in narrow money has risen strongly, and although aggregate broad money growth continues to slow, growth in the deposits of the non-financial private sector has been somewhat higher in 1999 so far.  The link from money growth to inflation is complicated in the short and medium term, but higher growth in money supports the projection of rising nominal demand growth.  Lending to individuals secured on dwellings has been growing more strongly, consistent with  greater activity in the housing market and a pick-up in house price inflation, and the MPC is now assuming that the ratio of house prices to average earnings will increase.

Nominal interest rate expectations have risen in the United Kingdom, especially around the two-year horizon.  It seems likely that part of this rise reflects a higher real cost of borrowing, as recent surveys have shown little movement in short-term inflation expectations.  But the continued rise in world long-term government bond yields suggests that investors may have revised upwards their expectations of global inflation over longer horizons.  UK equity prices have fallen slightly since the May Report, and the sterling exchange rate has depreciated.  11 Demand and output 2 GDP rose by 0.5% in 1999 Q2 following two quarters  of little growth.  The cumulative effect of the National Accounts revisions published on 29 July raised the level of GDP at constant market prices by 0.4% up to  1999 Q1, with upward revisions to private consumption and fixed investment.  Consumption growth has picked up in recent quarters, and the recovery in measures of consumer and business confidence seen at the time of the May Report has continued.  Domestic demand growth has been partly offset by continued negative contributions to growth from net trade, as import growth has remained strong and exports have been flat.  But the prospects for exports have improved since May, as the outlook for world growth and trade has strengthened.  2.1 External demand(1) Net trade has detracted from GDP growth each quarter since 1997 Q3, and over the year to 1999 Q1 made a negative contribution to growth of 2.3 percentage points—together with the previous two quarters, the largest for ten years.  The nominal deficit on trade in goods and services reached £4.4 billion in 1999 Q1 and the current account recorded a deficit of £2.5 billion. But the decline in the current account since the beginning of 1998 has been less marked than the widening of the trade deficit.  Higher investment income, resulting from returns on foreign direct investment, has partly offset the deficit on trade (see Chart 2.1).  A large proportion of UK foreign assets are held in the United States, so the strong performance of the US economy, and the US stock market, could help to account for this.  UK export volumes of goods and services fell by 1.1% over the year to 1999 Q1.  The slower growth of export volumes in 1997 and 1998 reflected the lagged effects of sterling’s appreciation and developments in non-EU economies, in particular the contraction of demand in emerging markets and oil-exporting economies (see Chart 2.2).  In recent quarters, however, export volumes of goods to EU economies have fallen whereas exports to economies outside the European Union have Chart 2.1 The UK current account, net investment  income and trade(a) 1994 95 96 97 98 99 Current account Investment income Net trade balance 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 + _ £ billions (a) At current market prices.

UK exports of goods to North America have grown at a fast rate, exports to Asia have risen and exports to the other non-EU economies have also picked up (see Table 2.A).  The strength of sterling against the euro and the slowdown in domestic demand in the larger European Union economies explain the widening of the UK trade deficit with the European Union.  The weakening of exports to the European Union is largely a result of falling export volumes to Germany, which accounts for some 13% of UK exports of goods.  Chart 2.3 shows that the United Kingdom’s export volume share of EU markets has declined since the beginning of 1997.    UK import demand depends on the strength of domestic demand, UK exports (which influence imports through re-export activity and demand for imported material inputs), the price of imports relative to domestically produced goods, and other factors such as changes in trade specialisation.  Chart 2.4 shows the extent of import penetration in the UK economy, measured by the ratio of import volumes to final expenditure (domestic demand and exports).  The upward trend is common for most countries.  It has been aided by progressive opening up of world markets, the reduction of trade protection and falling real transport costs.  UK import prices have fallen sharply compared with those for domestically produced goods since mid 1996.  This, combined with the recent outturns for domestic demand, would be expected to boost the volume of imports relative to domestic production and so accelerate import penetration.  However, import penetration has increased at a steady pace since 1995, with little noticeable acceleration following sterling’s appreciation.  Over the forecast period the MPC expects growth in domestic demand to be stronger than projected at the time of the May Report, but for import penetration to continue to rise at its recent steady pace. Looking ahead, the prospects for world growth and trade have improved further since the May Report.  The Asian Development Bank has projected stronger growth in 1999 for the emerging markets in Asia, with positive prospective growth overall for the newly industrialised economies (NIEs) and South East Asia.  Consensus Economics forecasts for Asia have been revised up. Forecasts for Latin America have improved marginally in July (see Chart 2.5), though perceptions of financial fragility in some parts of the region have increased since May.

Demand and output 13 Overall prospects in the major industrialised economies have also improved since May.  In the United States GDP grew by 4.1% in the year to 1999 Q2.  Annual GDP growth has been running at more than 3% for the past three years.  The timing or extent of any prospective slowdown in the US economy remains difficult to gauge. The outlook for Japan is a little brighter than three months ago:  industrial production was higher than expected in June and perhaps pointed to little change in GDP in Q2, rather than a fall.  Consensus Economics project slightly stronger activity in 1999 for Japan. Recent surveys of business confidence for France and Germany have pointed to a strengthening of growth in the second half of 1999 and in 2000. Taking all these developments together, the MPC expects world activity to be stronger than judged in May, as a result of higher US growth, and slightly brighter prospects for the euro area, Japan and developing economies.  That should increase world trade growth, and so the MPC’s central expectation for UK export market growth has been revised up to about 6% in 2000. A much lower negative contribution to GDP growth from net trade is expected in 2000 than in 1999.  But the MPC has assumed that there is a possible downside risk to world activity from a more pronounced slowdown in the US economy, for example linked to a steep decline in equity prices. 2.2 Domestic demand UK domestic demand rose by 0.7% in 1999 Q1, following an increase of 0.8% in 1998 Q4.  The National Accounts release on 29 July included revisions to domestic demand back to 1997.  The cumulative effect up to 1999 Q1 was to raise domestic demand by 0.7%, with upward revisions to consumption and investment. Consumption growth has strengthened since 1998 Q3 and business investment has also made a significant contribution to domestic demand growth (see Table 2.B). Quarterly growth of final domestic demand, which excludes the contribution from inventory investment, has been 1% or more for three consecutive quarters. Consumption The level of household consumption in the National Accounts was revised up and the cumulative effect of these revisions up to 1999 Q1 was 0.9%.  The slowdown in consumption growth in 1998 is now less marked than previously thought.  Consumption grew by 1.3% in  1999 Q1, up from 1.1% in 1998 Q4 (see Chart 2.6).  Part Chart 2.6 Household consumption growth 1990 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 Percentage changes Quarter on previous quarter Year on previous year Average annual growth rate (1955–99) + –  Inflation Report:  August 1999 14 of the increase in consumption in Q1 is likely to be erratic and is a result of the change of the registration date for new car sales from August to twice a year, in March and September.  That will have changed the seasonal pattern of vehicle spending and possibly boosted spending in the first quarter by around  1/4–1/2 percentage point.  But Table 2.C shows that the strength of consumption was broadly based.  More timely monthly indicators suggest that consumption growth may have remained robust in recent months.  Retail sales volumes rose by 0.9% in the three months to June.  The CBI Distributive Trades survey also pointed to a strengthening of retail demand;  the balance of retailers reporting a rise in sales compared with a year earlier rose to +20 in the three months to July from +10 in the previous three months.  However, retail contacts of the Bank’s regional Agents reported slow growth in retail sales in the latest three months, somewhat weaker than the evidence from the official data and other surveys.  The previous two Reports discussed possible reasons why the slowdown in consumers’ expenditure in 1998 appeared sharper than the MPC had expected, given the buoyancy of its main determinants (labour income and wealth).  The February and May Reports assumed that the relative weakness of consumers’ expenditure would persist, and would result in a slower pick-up in consumers’ expenditure over the forecast period than suggested by past behaviour.  But the latest data point to less of a slowdown in consumers’ expenditure in the first three quarters of 1998 and a strong recovery in 1998 Q4 and 1999 Q1 (even after adjusting for vehicle spending). That is more in line with past strong growth of labour income and wealth.  Therefore the MPC has revised its projection for consumers’ expenditure over the forecast period so that it is in line with past behaviour.  The MPC has also assumed that the risks to the forecast from consumption are on the upside over the next twelve to eighteen months.  The pattern of consumers’ expenditure growth over the past twelve months may have been linked to the turnaround in confidence, changes in official interest rates, and possibly to changes in equity and housing wealth.  Households aim to smooth expenditure by borrowing in response to short-term changes in income, and so will take into account expected future earnings and wealth when making spending decisions.  So changes in expectations about future earnings and wealth, and about Table 2.C Consumers’ expenditure on goods and services(a)(b) Percentage changes on a quarter earlier 1998 1999 Q3 Q4 Q1 Durable goods: Total 0.6 1.5 3.6 of which: Vehicles -0.8 2.3 3.6 Other durables 1.9 0.8 3.6 Non-durable goods: Total  -1.0 0.1 0.6 of which: Foods -1.0 -1.1 -0.3 Other goods -0.8 0.8 1.5 Clothing and footwear 1.4 0.0 2.9 Services 1.2 1.9 1.5 Total household expenditure 0.2 1.1 1.3 (a) At 1995 constant prices. (b) Seasonally adjusted.  Demand and output 15 the uncertainty surrounding them, can also affect spending.  Consumer confidence fell back sharply in the summer and autumn of 1998 in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, perhaps as a result of turbulence in global financial markets.  But since the beginning of 1999 confidence has improved and expectations of rising unemployment in the United Kingdom have fallen back (see Chart 2.7).  Household uncertainty about future employment and income appears to have diminished and that is likely to have contributed to the pick-up in expenditure.  Cuts in official interest rates since October 1998 are also likely to have led to a degree of substitution towards current, from future, consumption.  But the rise in medium-term yields since May, discussed in Section 1, might dampen the impact. Changes in wealth (financial and housing) may reflect changes in expectations about future income.  But changes in the composition of wealth may also indicate different paths for prospective aggregate consumption growth.  In the 1990s financial wealth has made a larger contribution than housing wealth to the increase in overall UK personal sector wealth, and the same is true for the United States (see Chart 2.8).  That contrasts with the 1980s when housing wealth was more important for the United Kingdom.   An increase in equity wealth may influence aggregate consumption less than an increase in housing wealth if the holders of equities tend to spend a lower proportion of any increase in income than homeowners (ie equity holders have a lower marginal propensity to consume). High-income households tend to have a lower propensity to consume than low-income households.  In the United Kingdom, as in the United States, equity wealth is skewed towards higher-income households, whereas housing wealth is more evenly distributed by income and net wealth (see Table 2.D).  This may mean that expenditure is less sensitive to an increase in equity wealth than housing wealth.  Furthermore, since around two thirds of household equity wealth in the United Kingdom is held indirectly by pension funds and insurance companies, it may be more difficult to use this form of wealth as collateral for borrowing. UK housing wealth began to rise as a proportion of total household wealth in 1998 and house prices appear to have accelerated in the first half of 1999, perhaps linked to the recovery in confidence.  An increase in house prices, relative to other goods and services, would Chart 2.7 Expectations of a rise in unemployment over  the next twelve months(a) 20 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 1988 90 92 94 96 98 Percentage balances   + _ Source:  GfK.

But an increase in house prices also raises the costs facing first-time buyers or those trading up to larger properties—and they may cut back on other forms of spending to invest in housing. This would tend to dampen the overall effect on expenditure on non-housing goods and services.  But a rise in housing wealth can boost the expenditure of homeowners who are able to use their house as  collateral against borrowing.  Latest data show that this may be beginning to happen.  Estimates of mortgage equity withdrawal were positive in 1999 Q1, having been negative most of the time since 1992.  Mortgage equity withdrawal may have partly substituted for unsecured borrowing (see Section 1).  Over the  forecast period house prices and therefore housing wealth and mortgage equity withdrawal are expected to strengthen. An increase in housing transactions could also influence consumers’ expenditure by bringing forward or raising spending on durables.  The number of loans approved and particulars delivered have risen by 17% and 8% respectively since mid 1998.  The pattern of durables spending since 1997 is also likely to have been influenced by the ‘windfall payouts’ from building society conversions.(1) Spending on durables is likely  to have been moved forward into 1997 and, as  Chart 2.9 shows, spending slowed markedly from the end of 1997.  The rise in 1999 Q1 might reflect some recovery to a more usual pattern of spending, given housing market transactions.  Further ‘windfall payouts’ are expected next year from, for example, the transfer of Scottish Widows’ business to the Lloyds TSB Group, and other demutualisations.  The estimated value of these is around a quarter of the size of the 1997 windfalls.  The turn of the Millennium may have some impact on the profile of consumers’ expenditure.  The Bank’s regional Agents have reported that firms in the food and drink sector are anticipating a greater than usual seasonal strengthening of demand in the second half of the year and are likely to build up stocks in advance.  Households are likely to stock up on these goods more than usual at the end of this year, for both celebratory and precautionary reasons.  To the extent that such spending is precautionary, it may bring forward expenditure that would otherwise have occurred in 2000 Q1.  This could affect the pattern of retail spending and inventory holding by firms around the end of the year.

Chart 2.10 Investment by sector Chart 2.11 Company profits and GDP growth Demand and output 17 Investment demand Whole-economy investment rose by 0.2% in 1999 Q1 and was 5.9% higher than a year earlier, following annual increases in investment of more than 7% every quarter since 1997 Q2.  Upward revisions to investment in 1997 and 1998 reflected new estimates for investment expenditure on computer equipment.  Business investment grew by 0.5% in the first quarter and was 11% higher than a year earlier (see Chart 2.10). The difference between current and desired capital stock levels is the major influence on investment, though costs may mean that adjustment to the desired capital stock is slow.  The desired capital stock cannot be measured but it, and therefore investment, will be affected by firms’ current profitability, their expectations of future demand and profits, the cost of capital, capacity utilisation and changes in technology.  Latest estimates suggest that total company profits have fallen substantially since early 1998, but these data are often subject to revision.  In 1999 Q1 total company profits were around 9% lower than a year earlier, excluding a statistical alignment adjustment used by the ONS to help balance the National Accounts.  Profits of private non-financial corporations (PNFCs) have fallen back from a peak in 1998 Q3 and were around 6% lower than a year earlier in 1999 Q1, also excluding the alignment adjustment.  The extent of the decline in profits therefore seems large, given that output in the whole economy grew by more than 1% over this period (see Chart 2.11).  Other evidence on the current state of company profits does not point to such a sharp decline: CBI business confidence has improved since mid 1998. The number of profit warnings was 6% higher in the first seven months of 1999 than in the same period in 1998. Investment in manufacturing and services has reflected the divergence between these sectors over the past two years.  In 1999 Q1 manufacturing investment was at its lowest level for more than two years.  But BCC and CBI measures of business confidence in the manufacturing sector have improved since the May Report.  The July CBI quarterly Industrial Trends survey reported that business optimism had recovered to a balance of 5%, the highest since the beginning of 1997.  And spare capacity was broadly in line with its historical average.  However, investment intentions, as measured by the BCC survey, suggested only weak increases in manufacturing investment in 1999 Q2—well below the average since the series began in 1989 (see Chart 2.12).

Inflation Report:  August 1999 18 Service sector investment has made an increasing contribution to overall business investment since 1993, as Chart 2.13 shows.  It accounted for 70% of total business investment in 1999 Q1, up from less than 50% in 1993;  annual growth in services’ investment has been close to 20% since 1998 Q2.  Increasing investment in computer technology has probably boosted service sector investment, as discussed in the May Report. Profit expectations, as measured by the BCC, have also recovered since the autumn of 1998.  The  BCC survey measure of capacity utilisation has increased a little and investment intentions are broadly in line with the  long-run average.  These suggest that further growth in service sector investment is likely.  Real general government investment fell by 6.2% in 1999 Q1 and was 2% higher than a year earlier.  But the  fall in Q1 is likely to be erratic.  The March Budget maintained the Government’s commitment to  increase the ratio of net public investment to GDP  to 1% by financial year 2001–02.  The growth rate of gross government investment is therefore likely to increase. The prospects for business investment are little changed from the May Report.  The profile continues to be influenced by the bringing forward of some investment spending on construction projects and IT in advance of the Millennium.  This is offset in 2000 by a slowdown in investment growth. Inventory investment Whole-economy inventories (excluding a statistical alignment adjustment) fell in 1999 Q1, following a build-up in inventories in 1998 (see Chart 2.14).  Firms have over time economised on inventory investment relative to output, as is evident from the long-run downward trend in the ratio of inventories to GDP.  Inventories will vary relative to output during a business cycle.  For example, a sharp drop in demand is likely to result in a build-up in inventories above desired levels. There is some evidence that this happened in mid 1998 when the CBI and CIPS manufacturing surveys both pointed to higher than desired stocks of finished goods.  The survey measures and official data have fallen back since then, suggesting that some adjustment has taken place (see Chart 2.15).  Since 1994 the inventories-to-GDP ratio has been broadly stable, compared with a long-run decline in the Chart 2.13 Business investment and the service  sector 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 Per cent Percentage change on a year earlier Business investment  growth  (left-hand scale)       Contribution of services to  the level of business investment  (right-hand scale)  10 5 0 5 10 15 20 + – 1993 94 95 96 97 98 99 Chart 2.14 Change in inventories(a) 1,600 1,200 800 400 0 400 800 1,200 1,600 + _ Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Other Distributive trades  Manufacturing  1998 99 £ millions Chart 2.15 Inventories of finished goods(a) 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Per cent Long-run average 1990–99 30 1994 95 96 97 98 99 Per cent balance 35 40 45 50 55 60 50 indicates a neutral level of  inventories CBI:  above desired levels(b) CIPS(c) Sources:  CBI, CIPS Manufacturing Survey.

Demand and output 19 ratio since the mid 1970s.  Changes in manufacturing largely accounted for the downward trend in inventories as a proportion of GDP, as Chart 2.16 shows, whereas distributive trades’ inventories have remained broadly constant.  Over time, it is likely that increased integration of production processes, through new technologies, has improved the efficiency of production.  That may have reduced the need for ‘work in progress’ inventories as a proportion of manufacturing output (see Chart 2.17). The change in pattern within the UK manufacturing sector away from traditional heavy engineering and towards new-technology industries has probably reduced the scale of work in progress inventories.  Changes in technology (for example business-to-business use of the Internet) are likely to continue to reduce inventories as a proportion of GDP.  The MPC has assumed that the downward trend will continue, but at a slower pace than in the 1970s and 1980s. Public sector demand Nominal general government consumption rose by 3.8% in the year to 1999 Q1.  In assessing the outlook for the public finances, the MPC has maintained as its central case the nominal government expenditure plans and effective tax rates from the 9 March Budget statement. The Government’s current nominal expenditure plans are for an increase in spending on goods and services of 5.3% in financial year 1999–2000.  The overall stance of fiscal policy is the same as in the May Report.  HM Treasury projects a structural tightening in terms of the cyclically adjusted net borrowing position of some 0.3% of GDP between 1998–99 and 2000–01. 2.3 Output According to preliminary estimates, GDP (at constant market prices) grew by 0.5% in 1999 Q2.  The annual growth rate remained at 1.2% (see Chart 2.18).  The changes to the National Accounts for the 1999 Blue  Book resulted in revisions to the output side of the accounts which raised the level of output by 0.4% and increased the annual growth rate in 1999 Q1 to 1.2% from 0.7%.   Growth in the service sector was 0.5% in 1999 Q2 and annual growth was 2.4%.  Latest data for 1999 Q1 showed that output in the production and agricultural sectors had continued to contract (see Chart 2.19). Agricultural output has been falling since 1997.  But agriculture has been affected by sector-specific shocks, which are discussed in the box on pages 20–21.

Inflation Report:  August 1999 20 The three main sectors of UK agriculture are:  arable crops and horticulture, which accounted for around 38% of the value of agricultural output in 1998;  livestock which accounted for 33%;  and dairy farming which accounted for 19%.  The sector accounted for around 1.3% of GDP at basic prices in 1998, down from 2% in 1989.  Agriculture’s share of the United Kingdom’s workforce in employment was around 2% in 1998, down from just under 21/2% in 1989.  Many more people are indirectly dependent on the agricultural sector within rural communities and supporting industries.  Chart A shows how agricultural sector output has evolved very differently from the economy as a whole.  This is partly because agriculture often faces specific supply and demand shocks that are different from those faced by other sectors.  For example the sharp drop in agricultural production recorded by the National Accounts at the beginning of 1993 was the result of a change in the Common Agricultural Policy:  land set aside from arable farming was increased and that was excluded from production.  But it is also the case that some  whole-economy shocks, such as exchange rate changes, have a bigger impact on agriculture than on some other sectors. Over the past three years there have been a number of developments that have had severe adverse effects on the United Kingdom’s agricultural sector.  World dollar agricultural prices fell sharply in 1998, following the financial crises and compression of demand from Asia and Latin America.   Within the European Union, and in the United Kingdom, the prices of cereals, meat and dairy products are set by the system of support prices with reference to  Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).  These products account for more than two thirds of total agricultural output in the United Kingdom.  Support prices are set in euros (Ecu prior to January 1999) and although they were reduced between 1992 and 1995 they have been broadly unchanged since then.  Sharp falls in world agricultural prices have resulted in an increased divergence between world prices and high EU euro support prices for cereals, meat and dairy products. But sterling prices of these products have fallen sharply since 1996, as sterling has appreciated against other European currencies and the euro.  Chart B shows how changes in the Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Fishing (MAFF) agricultural price index are broadly influenced by exchange rate changes.  But prices of some products such as root crops have moved very differently from cereals, dairy and livestock prices (see Chart C).  Farmers have been partly compensated for lower support prices by subsidies to income.  Following the reforms to the CAP which came into effect in the mid 1990s, total direct subsidies (net of levies) received by UK farmers reached a peak of £4.1 billion in 1996–97.  In 1998–99 these fell back to £3.3 billion, reflecting reduced payments relating to lower payouts from the Bovine  Agriculture The share of the agricultural sector in GDP has contracted in recent years, and income from agriculture has fallen sharply. In 1998 it was around 40% lower than its average for the 1990s.  Falling world commodity prices and the appreciation of sterling’s effective exchange rate have had a marked effect on the sector.  Product-specific shocks and longer-term factors have also affected the balance of supply and demand for commodities.  As with the other primary sectors, agricultural output is more volatile than whole-economy GDP.

Demand and output 21 Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) schemes and lower payments for the wheat and barley Arable Area scheme. In addition to these developments, there have been a number of specific shocks to demand for UK produce. The main shock was the reduction in demand for beef following the BSE crisis in March 1996.  That has reduced the livestock output of cattle and calves by 23%. The BSE crisis has also had knock-on effects on other livestock prices.  It prompted a further switch from world beef production towards other meat such as lamb, pork and poultry.  Production has increased rapidly in some of these sectors in recent years, resulting in a sharp decline in wholesale prices for these products. All of these developments contributed to the sharp fall in farming incomes;  in 1998 they were around 30% lower than in 1997 and around 40% lower than the average for the 1990s.  Information from the Farm Business Surveys suggests that reductions in income were seen across most types of farming between financial year 1997–98 and 1998–99.  Despite the cheaper cost of feedstuffs, incomes in the dairy sector fell because of lower milk prices. Overseas competition led to lower incomes in cattle and sheep farming. The latest summary of business conditions by the Bank’s regional Agents suggests that the strength of sterling continued to bear down on incomes in the first half of 1999, and UK farmers may have lost market share to the overseas sector.  Confidence has been very weak and declined a little through the second quarter, perhaps reflecting the strength of sterling against the euro over that period.  However, this was partly offset by the  recent stabilisation of some commodity prices (see Section 4). Looking ahead, the outlook for world prices of commodities has firmed since the May Report, as a result of improved prospects for world growth and trade.  This may be reflected in higher agricultural demand within the European Union over coming quarters.  The reforms to the CAP agreed under Agenda 2000 will reduce the prices of cereals, livestock, and dairy products, and move them closer to world prices.  That may also raise EU demand.  Overall this is likely to have a further impact on farm incomes from 2000, though increases in direct payments to farmers will partly offset the effect of lower support prices.  The Agenda 2000 agreement includes cuts in support prices of 15% for cereals and 20% for beef, phased in over two and three years, respectively, from 2000.  Cuts in support prices for dairy products have been delayed until 2005–06. The reforms are likely to have different effects on the arable, dairy and livestock sectors.  MAFF estimates  that, in the absence of structural adjustment, specialist arable farmers would lose revenues as a result of the reforms, but beef and sheep farmers would gain overall. Greater pressure on the European Union to open up further its agricultural markets is likely to arise from World Trade Organisation negotiations which begin  in 2000.  In addition, the EU countries may reconsider  the CAP in the context of discussions over EU enlargement.   As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, the lifting of the worldwide ban on exports of beef on 1 August should gradually improve the prospects for the sector.  The outlook for agriculture as a whole could improve as world commodity prices become firmer.  But developments will continue to depend on sterling’s exchange rate against the euro.  The agricultural sector also remains vulnerable to supply shocks that make production more volatile than in other sectors of the economy. The pick-up in service sector growth in Q2 and survey evidence point to a renewed strengthening of growth. The BCC services survey reported higher home deliveries in Q2, together with an improvement in orders.  The CIPS services survey has also shown a turnaround in overall and new business activity, which rose to their highest levels since March 1998.

Inflation Report:  August 1999 22 Manufacturing output growth was revised up by  0.3–0.4 percentage points in 1997 and 1998.  But the pattern of growth was little changed.  In recent months the contraction in the production industries has diminished.  In 1999 Q2 manufacturing output rose by 0.4%, following three quarters of falling output, and was 1.2% lower than a year earlier.  Survey data suggest that manufacturing may have reached a turning-point.  The July CIPS purchasing managers’ index rose to 52.7 and was above the neutral level of 50, indicating an expansion rather than contraction in activity.  The CIPS total new orders and export orders indicators rose significantly in July.  And the CBI and BCC survey responses on domestic and export orders have also improved since the end of 1998. Construction output rose by 0.2% in 1999 Q1 and activity appears to have continued to rise in Q2.  New construction orders rose in the three months to May. And the CIPS survey measure of total construction activity rose to 64.5 in June, well above the average of 48.5 in the second half of 1998.  But housing starts were a little lower in the latest three months.   2.4 Summary The cumulative effect of the revisions to the National Accounts was to raise the level of GDP by 0.4% up to 1999 Q1, with upward revisions to consumption and fixed investment.  Consumers’ expenditure has strengthened since 1998 Q3 and the recovery in measures of consumer and business confidence seen at the time of the May Report has been maintained.  The MPC has raised the profile of consumers’ expenditure over the forecast period.  The overall prospects for activity have improved since the May Report. Developments in the world economy have been moderately favourable over the past three months and the MPC has revised up its projection for world activity and trade.  Compared with the May Report, the MPC’s central projection is for a sharper increase in GDP growth in the near term, before levelling off at around 3% a year.

The LFS unemployment rate has remained stable at around 6.2%, lower than its previous trough in 1990, and the claimant count has fallen close to 20-year lows.  Growth in employment and hours has slowed, but forward-looking indicators no longer suggest that whole-economy employment will fall substantially, and some point to a pick-up in growth.  Despite the persistent strength of labour demand relative to expectations, nominal earnings growth has continued to decline.  The headline Average Earnings Index measure of annual earnings growth fell to 4.3% in May, reflecting the significant reduction in private sector settlements relative to a year ago—partly because of lower inflation expectations— and a moderation of other pay elements sensitive to movements in economic activity, including overtime and bonuses. 3.1 Earnings Whole-economy annual earnings growth fell from a peak of 5.7% last June to 4.3% in May, according to the headline measure of the official Average Earnings Index (AEI), a backward-looking three-month average (see Chart 3.1).  Recent monthly AEI outturns have been volatile:  the measured twelve-month growth rate of average earnings rose from a low point of 4.2% in December to 5.0% in February, before falling back to 4.0% in April and May.  Following the recent independent review of the AEI,(1) the ONS is carrying out further work to improve the quality of the index, focusing in particular on updating and expanding the sample of reporting firms.  While this work is taking place, the MPC has agreed that the path of earnings growth should be treated as more than usually uncertain. In forming its central projection, the MPC continues to take account of a range of other indicators of pay pressures. (1) Review of the revisions to the Average Earnings Index:  Report submitted by Sir Andrew Turnbull and Mervyn King to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, prepared by Peter Sedgwick and Martin Weale, The Stationery Office Limited, March 1999.  The main findings and recommendations of the Report are summarised in the box on page 24 of the May 1999 Inflation Report.

(a) Twelve-month private sector mean, weighted by sectoral employment  shares from the 1996 Annual Employment Survey. Sources:  Barclays Basix survey and ONS. The decline in the official measure of earnings growth since last June is more than accounted for by a slowdown in the growth of private sector pay (see Chart 3.1).  Other indicators also point to an easing in private sector wage pressures.  The Reward Index of earnings growth—based on an independent survey covering almost 900,000 employees, predominantly in the private sector—fell  to 3.6% in June, and the Bank’s twelve-month  employment-weighted measure of private sector settlements declined to 3.5% (see Chart 3.2).   Shorter-term measures have been even weaker:  the average private sector settlement in the three months to May was 3.0%, 0.8 percentage points lower than a year earlier, and the lowest since 1994.  The three-month average picked up in June, as the final stage of a  three-year pay deal for construction workers came into effect.  But average settlements in other parts of the private sector were stable. The factors accounting for the decline in private sector settlements appear broadly based.  Table 3.A, drawn from the CBI’s settlements survey, shows how firms’ views of the key influences on pay settlements have changed since last year.  A reading of -17 against ‘cost of living’, for example, shows that the balance of firms identifying increases in the cost of living as a very important upward pressure on pay settlements has fallen by 17 percentage points between last year’s settlements round and this.  In all but two of the categories in the table, pay pressures are perceived to have weakened compared with a year ago.  Lower growth in orders and profits, and reduced concerns about recruitment and retention, have been key factors, but the most important single influence has been the fall in the growth of the cost of living, or inflation. Inflation affects nominal earnings growth in several ways.  During pay negotiations, wage-bargainers need to form expectations of future inflation in order to assess the real value of pay offers.  For a given rate of expected real wage growth, lower inflation expectations imply lower nominal wage growth.  Inflation expectations will be influenced by various factors, in particular the credibility of the monetary policy framework, but also the cyclical position of the economy, and recent inflation outturns.  As Chart 3.3 shows, current inflation and a representative survey measure of expected inflation have both fallen over the past year or so.  Inflation outturns also affect the real value of the wage received over the past year relative to that anticipated a year ago.  When inflation is higher than expected, real wage growth will Table 3.A Change in factors affecting private sector settlements between 1997/98 and 1998/99(a) Change in balance Services Manufacturing Cost of living -17 -17 Profits -14 -13 Recruitment/retention -5 -13 Orders -3 -12 Ability to adjust prices 1 -4 Productivity 5 -1 Source:  CBI Pay Databank Report. (a) The table shows the change in the balance of firms identifying the factors  shown as ‘very important’ upward pressures on settlements between 1997/98 (1.8.97–31.7.98) and 1998/99 (1.8.98–30.6.99).  The labour market 25 be correspondingly lower, which may put some upward pressure on settlements as wage-earners seek to recoup lost real income.  In fact, as Chart 3.3 shows, inflation on the RPI measure has been rather lower than bargainers expected over the past year.  So higher-than-expected real wage growth over the past year may also have been a factor reducing upward pressures on this year’s settlements. In addition to the basic wage settlement, recent growth in earnings per worker will have reflected many other influences, including changes in overtime and bonuses, and individual payments to meet the requirements of the National Minimum Wage (NMW).  Annual growth in overtime has continued to fall, consistent with the slowdown in annual output growth.  According to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), the average number of paid overtime hours per worker fell by 10% in the three months to May, compared with the same period a year earlier.  The recent behaviour of bonuses is less clear.  A large part of the slowdown in the headline AEI measure between last summer and January this year reflected lower measured growth in bonuses, consistent with the weaker growth in profits in the preceding period.  In February, however, the ONS changed the way in which bonus data are collected,(1) which—although beneficial in the longer term—means that neither the official data on annual bonus growth, nor those on annual growth in regular pay (calculated by subtracting measured bonuses from total pay), can be used as reliable indicators of the true bonus contribution to annual earnings growth until February 2000.  The Bank’s regional Agents report that, in some sectors and regions, where profits and orders growth have remained strong or where there have been persistent skill shortages, pressures to maintain bonuses remain.  But overall, bonuses and other special payments appear to have been somewhat weaker in the first half of 1999 than they were in 1998, when bonuses were unusually strong.  So lower bonuses have probably contributed to the further slowdown in annual earnings growth. The slowdown in private sector earnings growth may also indicate a weaker-than-expected initial impact from the National Minimum Wage, which came into force on 1 April.  The NMW affects about 1.9 million workers directly, and—assuming full implementation and no (1) Previously, firms were asked to report bonuses only when there had been a ‘significant’ change.  Since February, they have been asked to report all bonuses paid.  Inflation Report:  August 1999 26 other behavioural responses—would imply a rise of some 0.6% in the whole-economy pay bill.  In previous Reports, the MPC assumed that the actual impact on the level of earnings in 1999 Q2 would be a little lower than this, as the effects of anticipation, substitution, mitigation and any non-compliance more than outweighed upward pressure from differentials restoration.(1) It is too soon to assess these assumptions against the outturns.  The Average Earnings Index is unlikely to capture the full effect of the NMW, because a disproportionate number of those entitled to a pay rise from the NMW work in firms that are too small to be selected for the AEI sample.  Nor do the latest hourly wage distribution data from the LFS—which cover the period March-May—provide a clear guide:  it is unclear how much of the distribution reflects pay received after 1 April, and some LFS survey respondents are known to have a tendency to  under-report average hourly pay levels.  The ONS has a method of adjusting for this bias, but it requires data from the 1999 New Earnings Survey, and these will not become available until October.  Given these uncertainties, the MPC has decided not to adjust its assumptions about the impact of the NMW on earnings growth in the central projection until a clearer picture emerges later in the year.  But the risk of a more substantial upward effect has been removed. In contrast to the slowdown in private sector earnings growth, public sector pay growth has risen (see  Chart 3.1).  The pick-up in growth since mid 1997 may reflect something of a stabilisation in average relative pay rates, after a period in which average earnings in the public sector fell quite sharply compared with those in the private sector (see Chart 3.4).  But the direct implications for RPIX inflation of these latest movements are likely to be relatively modest.  First, although public pay was boosted in April by the implementation of the pay review body awards, some of the rise in the annual growth rate will be temporary, reflecting the fact that, whereas this year’s awards were applied in full from April, many of last year’s settlements were staged, with part of the settlement delayed until December 1998 (see Chart 3.5).  This effect will unwind at the end of this year.  Second, rises in public sector pay have little direct impact on measured inflation, because few public sector services are included in the RPIX basket.  Third, the impact on domestic demand is unlikely to differ much from that already implied by the Government’s published fiscal plans, as long as this year’s pay awards do not Chart 3.4 Ratio of public sector to private sector  earnings(a) 90 92 94 96 98 100 102 104 106 108 1990 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 1995 = 100 Chart 3.5 Public sector wage bill(a) Nurses 10% Doctors 7% Civil service 12% Other NHS 8% Teachers 12% Other (mainly public corporations) 19% Other local authority 20% NHS Local authority Other Staff receiving staged  settlements in 1998/99 Other review bodies 7% Police and fire 6% Source:  HM Treasury.

The labour market 27 cause the Government to overshoot its expenditure targets.  Given the path of government spending, the effects on aggregate demand of a change in the share of this spending allocated to pay are likely to be limited. Finally, it is possible that the rise in public sector pay growth may put some upward pressure on private sector wages.  Such effects may be stronger when the overall labour market is relatively tight, as it has been recently. But econometric evidence suggests that, over the past  20 years, changes in public sector pay have typically followed, rather than led, changes in private sector pay. 3.2 Employment and unemployment Employment growth has continued to slow, but less rapidly than had been expected at the turn of the year. LFS employment, a measure of the number of people in work based on a continuous survey of households, rose by 20,000 (0.1%) in the three months to May, compared with a rise of 79,000 (0.3%) in the previous three months.  Workforce jobs, a measure of the number of jobs in the economy based on a quarterly survey of firms, fell by 4,000 in Q1, as a 51,000 fall in manufacturing employment was only partly offset by a rise in the number of service sector jobs.  Growth in Workforce jobs has been rather weaker than growth in LFS employment in recent quarters (see Chart 3.6), but these differences are not unusually large.  The two series measure slightly different employment concepts and use different sampling methods.(1) The number of hours worked is in principle a better measure of labour usage.  Growth in total hours worked has fallen more sharply than employment growth since the middle of last year (see Chart 3.6), reflecting a decline in average hours worked per person.  The combination of flat or rising employment and falling average hours is likely to reflect a number of factors. First, the Bank’s regional Agents report that, in some sectors and regions facing lower demand growth, firms have sought to avoid the costs of hiring and firing more highly skilled staff by cutting overtime and other hours rather than employment, in the expectation that demand would pick up again relatively soon.  Second, since last summer there has been a slight rise in the share of employment accounted for by part-timers, who typically work about 40% of the hours of full-timers.  And third, some of the decline since October in the share of employees working longer hours (see Chart 3.7) may Chart 3.6 Growth in employment and hours(a) 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 1996 97 98 99 Percentage changes on a year earlier LFS employment  LFS total hours worked  Workforce jobs (a) Workforce jobs data adjusted for a discontinuity in 1995.

Inflation Report:  August 1999 28 reflect the effects of the introduction of the Working Time Directive, which places restrictions on working more than 48 hours a week. The continued strength of employment in the face of the slowdown in annual demand growth implied a further decline in labour productivity growth in 1999 Q1, although the upward revisions to GDP, discussed in Section 2, have raised the level relative to previous estimates.  Annual growth in the official measure of productivity per worker fell from 1.1% in 1998 Q4 to 1.0% in Q1.  Hourly productivity growth has been rather higher in recent quarters, reflecting the more rapid slowdown in hours worked, but it also fell in Q1.  The decline in productivity growth raised unit wage cost growth further, to 4.4% in Q1 (see Chart 3.8).   Since 1995, productivity growth has been below its  long-run trend.  There is no strong evidence that the trend growth rate has shifted.  But the cyclical movements in productivity growth around this trend have been rather less pronounced during the 1990s, consistent with the possibility that changes in the structure of the labour market over the past two decades have given firms greater scope to vary both employment and hours worked in response to changes in current and expected demand.  It is also possible that some of the slower growth in the second half of the 1990s reflects a one-off shift in the average level of productivity, consistent with labour market reforms encouraging new workers into the labour market.  In its central projection, the MPC has attached some weight to both of these possibilities. Growth in productivity per worker is projected to rise back above its trend rate over the forecast period, but the level of productivity is expected to remain somewhat lower than that implied by previous trends. The short-run outlook for productivity growth partly depends on the path of employment growth.  Surveys paint a mixed picture, but none suggests that a sharp fall in employment is likely over the next three to six months, and some indicate a modest recovery in expectations.  Measures of firms’ employment intentions from the British Chambers of Commerce and the Confederation of British Industry have picked up since the previous Report (see Table 3.B), and growth in demand for permanent and temporary staff across a range of sectors has recovered a little since the turn of the year, according to the Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services (FRES).

The labour market 29 newspaper recruitment advertising with figures on the number of vacancies at Jobcentres,(1) remain consistent with a small decline in whole-economy employment in the coming months (see Charts 3.9 and 3.10). Pay pressures are influenced by, among other things, the gap between the demand for, and the effective supply of, labour.  Although increments to the labour supply are typically drawn from those without work, not all of these people exert the same degree of influence on wages.  In its central projection, the MPC pays particular attention to those searching for, and available for, work.  The LFS unemployment rate—a measure of the size of this group—has remained broadly stable since last summer at around 6.2%, lower than the previous cyclical trough in 1990.  The claimant count rate, another measure of unemployment based on the number of people receiving benefit and available for work, was 4.4% in June, close to 20-year lows (see Chart 3.11).  Recent unemployment outturns have been lower than expected at the start of the year, and most external forecasters have lowered their projections for the path of unemployment over the next two years. Earnings growth has been unexpectedly weak, given the persistently low level of unemployment.  As discussed above, much of the decline in nominal earnings growth since last summer reflects lower inflation expectations and the cyclical decline in profits, productivity and output growth, rather than the direct impact of labour market conditions.  Growth in real unit labour costs— nominal earnings and other labour costs adjusted for inflation and productivity—has continued to pick up, consistent with some upward pressure from labour market tightness.  But, for given rates of unemployment, real unit labour cost growth has been considerably weaker in the 1990s recovery than it was at a similar point in the previous cycle (see Chart 3.12).  It is possible that this reflects a decline in the equilibrium rate of unemployment, consistent with labour market reforms and structural changes in the economy over the past two decades.  But it is impossible to say with any certainty where this rate currently lies. Another potential reason for the weakness of real earnings growth relative to unemployment is that unemployment may be an inappropriate summary measure of wage pressure, because it takes inadequate account of the heterogeneity of the labour market.

Inflation Report:  August 1999 30 example, the short-term unemployed may place more downward pressure on wages than the longer-term unemployed, to the extent that they have more of the  up-to-date skills and experience currently valued by employers.  While aggregate unemployment has been flat or falling compared with a year ago, the number of those in short-term unemployment (of a year or less) has risen a little, according to the LFS.  Pay pressures may also be influenced by those who say they want a job but are not currently available for work, and other groups classed as ‘economically inactive’ rather than unemployed, who collectively account for more than three quarters of non-employment among people of working age. Table 3.C illustrates how the likelihood of becoming employed varied for different groups of the unemployed and inactive in spring 1995.  For example, the first row shows that 35% of those who had been unemployed for less than six months at the start of the period were in employment three months later.  Overall, the unemployed were much more likely to become employed than the inactive.  But the shorter-term unemployed were much more likely to find a job than the long-term unemployed.  And all of those classed as inactive had some positive chance of entering work, with one group in particular—those actively searching but not currently available for work, including students—being more likely to find a job than those who had been unemployed for more than twelve months.  These probability rates vary over the cycle, and could also be affected by policy changes such as the Working Families Tax Credit, which comes into effect in October and is designed to increase the number of people willing to move into work from inactivity by increasing the incentive to work.  But the relative transition rates between the groups may be somewhat more stable over time.  An alternative measure of unemployment, which weights together the number of people in each group using the probabilities shown in the table relative to the probability that someone unemployed for six months or less will find a job, is shown in Chart 3.13.  The measure has not fallen quite as far relative to the previous trough as unemployment.  But the difference is small.  On this measure too, labour market conditions appear to be tight by recent historical standards. 3.3 Summary Nominal earnings growth has eased.

Overtime payments are lower than a year ago, and bonuses appear to have fallen.  In the light of this, the MPC has lowered the short-term profile for nominal earnings growth in the central projection.   While nominal earnings growth has eased, unemployment has remained close to 20-year lows, and the outlook for employment has improved somewhat since May.  As demand growth picks up, a central question for the inflation outlook is the extent to which the available capacity in the labour market will allow growth in employment and hours worked to rise, before triggering renewed inflationary pressures on pay.  It is possible that the relative weakness of real earnings growth, given the low levels of unemployment, indicates somewhat greater labour market capacity than previously thought, perhaps reflecting the impact of government reforms and structural changes over the past 20 years. But there is very considerable uncertainty about the potential size of any such effect.  The Committee’s judgments on the medium-term outlook for earnings are discussed in more detail in Section 6 of this Report.  32 4 Costs and prices Chart 4.1 Brent crude oil prices 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 1995 96 97 98 99 US dollars per barrel One-month future 0 contract Chart 4.2 Implied distribution for oil prices(a)(b) 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 1995 96 97 98 99 2000 0 Expectations as at c.o.b 5 May 1999 Per cent Sources:  NYMEX and Bank of England.

RPIX inflation fell below target in Q2, primarily reflecting movements in import prices and earnings growth.  The prices of oil and a number of other commodities have risen since the May Report, although many remain below their levels a year ago.  Import prices remain subdued, though their annual rate of decline has slowed.  Similarly, UK manufacturing producer prices have fallen less sharply since the end of 1998.  But survey indicators suggest that the rise in costs and prices in the service sector has moderated. 4.1 Raw materials and commodity prices Oil prices rose further in the past three months, and are well above the low recorded in December 1998.  Prices for Brent crude oil rose to more than $19 in July, from around $16 at the time of the May Report (see  Chart 4.1).  This increase reflected higher prospective world demand growth, recent estimated declines in oil stocks, and changing market perceptions of likely future oil supply.  The latter have been affected by reports of greater compliance by OPEC members with the organisation’s production quotas. Probability distributions of expected oil prices derived from options prices are shown in Chart 4.2.  They show that, despite recent sharp oil price movements, the degree of uncertainty about the level of future oil prices has remained broadly unchanged since the May Report. In line with market views, the MPC has assumed that some of the rise in oil prices which occurred in July will persist.  But part of the recent increase is attributed to short-term factors that are expected to reverse quickly. World prices for non-oil commodities in 1999 Q1 were well below their levels a year earlier.  Prices of many of these commodities had begun to rise by the spring, though the increase in prices was generally smaller than for crude oil.  Price rises were also more marked for hard commodities, such as metals, than for soft commodities, such as agricultural products.  But the rise in prices was sufficient for the Bank’s non-oil commodity price index to have recorded positive annual inflation rates in  1999 Q2 for the first time since mid 1996 (see  Chart 4.3).   10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 8 Expectations as at c.o.b 4 August 1999 Per cent 0 1995 96 97 98 99 2000  Costs and prices 33 Chart 4.3 Bank sterling commodity price indices(a) 20 15 10 5 0 5 10 15 Percentage changes on a year earlier + _ Including oil Excluding oil 1995 96 97 98 99 Source:  Bank of England. (a) Monthly average of prices of primary commodities, weighted by their importance in UK demand. The Economist index of sterling non-oil commodity prices was rather weaker than the Bank’s index in the second quarter.  The Economist index was 1.1% higher in the three months to June than in the previous three months, but 10.3% below its level in the same period a year earlier.  The difference between the two indices partly reflects differences in coverage.  The two indices also have different weights, with those in the Bank’s index reflecting UK demand patterns while the Economist index is weighted by OECD imports.  This particularly affects the treatment of food in the two indices.  Wholesale food prices have a higher weight in the Bank’s index than in the Economist index, and the Bank’s measure of food prices has experienced less marked deflation than the Economist measure of world food prices (see Chart 4.4).  Furthermore, the Bank’s measure is derived from Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) agricultural prices, which reflect the effects of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in moderating the extent to which changes in world food prices affect UK wholesale prices. The World Bank and the Economist Intelligence Unit project lower average non-oil dollar commodity prices in 1999 than in 1998.  But the rise in prices in recent months, particularly for hard commodities, is consistent with their projections of an increase in prices in the second half of 1999 and through 2000, as global demand strengthens and stock overhangs are eroded.  The MPC’s central projection is broadly in line with these views. 4.2 Import prices and the exchange rate Sterling import prices were 0.7% lower in 1999 Q1 than in 1998 Q4, and 4.1% lower than in the first quarter of 1998.  This continued fall reflected a further marked decline in imported goods prices in Q1, which were 5.6% below their levels a year earlier.  Imported services prices were 1.5% higher on the same comparison.  But the annual rate of decline in overall import prices has moderated since 1998 Q3, and monthly data on international trade suggest that goods import prices may have stabilised in 1999 Q2.  Sterling import prices for goods and services fell by 14% between 1996 Q3 and 1999 Q1.  The extent of the fall in sterling import prices was less than might have been expected given the marked sterling exchange rate appreciation over this period (see Chart 4.5), particularly since world export prices fell in local currency terms in 1997 and 1998.

That might have reflected overseas producers’ uncertainty about the persistence of the higher sterling exchange rate.   Some further pass-through of the effects of past exchange rate appreciation may therefore act to dampen sterling prices for UK imports.  But the MPC’s central projection assumes that any such lagged exchange rate effects are more than offset by factors such as projected rises in commodity prices and world export prices, as global demand recovers.  Hence sterling import prices are projected to begin rising in the coming quarters. 4.3 Costs and prices in manufacturing Prices of inputs to manufacturing industry remain below their levels a year earlier (see Chart 4.6).  However, the annual rate of decline in input prices slowed to 1.7% in 1999 Q2, from 5.5% in 1999 Q1 and an average decline of 9.1% in 1998.  That partly reflects the recent rise in oil prices, which directly account for around one tenth of the index.  These data were consistent with survey measures such as the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) index of prices paid by manufacturers.  This index rose in Q2, though it remained at a level which suggested that input prices continued to decline.  Reports from the Bank’s regional Agents also suggest that the downward pressure on manufacturers’ input prices may be moderating. Manufacturing output prices rose markedly in March and April, mainly reflecting the effect of higher duties introduced in the 1999 Budget.  Excluding these duties, output prices rose slightly in the three months to June, and were a little below their level a year earlier (see Chart 4.6).  Excluding volatile components such as food, drink, tobacco and petrol, output prices were broadly unchanged in the first half of 1999.  By contrast, the CBI quarterly Industrial Trends survey suggested steeper declines in output prices in July compared with April.    Manufacturers’ weighted costs in recent months have risen above their levels a year earlier, though they fell back somewhat in May (see Table 4.A).  The implications of this rise for future output prices will depend on the behaviour of manufacturers’ price   Costs and prices 35 Chart 4.7 CIPS services survey 44 46 48 50 52 54 56 58 60 62 July Nov.

Research at the Bank has shown that mark-ups tend to move procyclically with economic activity in the United Kingdom, but the full effects of any change in activity are only felt with a lag.(1) Hence the effect of the past slowdown in economic growth may limit the degree to which cost increases are reflected in higher manufacturing prices in the coming months.  Reports from the Bank’s regional Agents suggest that international competition is also limiting manufacturers’ ability to increase their price mark-ups over costs. 4.4 Costs and prices in the service sector The CIPS indices of input prices and prices charged in the service sector both remained above the neutral level of 50 in the three months to July, signifying a net balance of respondents reporting price increases.  But the levels of the CIPS indices suggested that the strength of inflation in service sector costs and prices eased in recent months (see Chart 4.7).  The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) quarterly economic survey also reported muted inflationary pressure.  The balance of service sector firms reporting likely price increases in the coming three months fell markedly in Q2.  The lower balance reflected declines in the number of firms expecting upward pressure on prices from pay settlements, raw materials costs or financial costs. The ONS corporate services price indices, which remain under development, pointed to lower inflation in 1999 Q1 in some services.  The indices are similar in concept to the components of the ONS manufacturing output prices index.  Of the twelve sub-series that are currently published, seven categories of business services  recorded lower inflation in 1999 Q1 than in 1998 Q4, one showed no change and four suggested higher inflation. 4.5 Retail prices Inflation in retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments (RPIX) fell to 2.1% in May, though it rose to 2.2% in June.  RPIX inflation in 1999 Q2 as a whole was 0.2 percentage points below the government’s target of 21/2%, and below expectations at the time of the May Report.  Services price inflation remained at 3.3% throughout Q2, just below the average for Q1.  Hence most of the decline in RPIX inflation has been (1) Small, I (1998), ‘The cyclicality of mark-ups and profit margins’, Quarterly Bulletin, August, pages 267–73.

Annual growth in other key retail price indices also slowed in Q2 (see Chart 4.8).  Inflation in RPIY, which also excludes indirect and local authorities’ taxes, fell to 1.6% in Q2.  The headline  RPI inflation rate fell to 1.4% in Q2, reflecting lower interest rates and hence lower mortgage interest payments. The decline in the rate of goods price inflation partly reflected temporary factors.  One was the direct effect of changes in duties on RPIX (see Table 4.B).  The May Report noted that higher indirect tax rates following the 1999 Budget had increased RPIX inflation to 2.7% in March.  As expected, most of the rise was reversed in Q2, owing largely to the 1998 increase in road fuel taxes dropping out of the calculation of the annual inflation rate.  Other fiscal measures from 1998 will drop out later this year, and these are expected to make a further negative contribution to RPIX inflation in  December 1999 and January 2000. Recent declines in import prices were also important in dampening inflation in 1999 Q2.  Certain non-food components of the RPIX correspond closely to the most import-intensive sectors of the UK economy.  Changes in these RPIX components can account for much of the fall in RPIX inflation between March and May that was not explained by changes in duties.  Chart 4.9 shows the influence of price declines in these sectors on RPIX goods price inflation since mid 1998.  But prices in import-intensive sectors, as in other sectors, will have been affected in Q2 by the cost of domestic inputs as well as imported inputs.  In particular, cost pressures may have been reduced by slower growth in earnings. Import prices are expected to contribute positively to RPIX inflation by the end of the forecast period, consistent with the MPC’s assumption that sterling import prices will begin to rise in the coming quarters. The associated exchange rate assumption, as well as the prospects for earnings growth, is discussed in Section 6 of this Report.   The volatility of retail services price inflation has tended to be lower than that of goods price inflation, and has fallen since 1997 to its lowest level on record (see  Chart 4.10).  One explanation for this is that the service sector is less import-intensive than the goods sector.  It is therefore less affected by international shocks such as fluctuations in the exchange rate and movements in overseas producer prices, so that services prices may Chart 4.8 Retail price inflation(a) 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 1995 96 97 98 99 Percentage changes on a year earlier RPI RPIX RPIY RPIX = Retail price index excluding mortgage interest payments.

However, services prices do have some import content and goods prices are also influenced by domestic pressures.  So other measures of domestically generated inflation (DGI) are constructed in an attempt to strip out international influences on UK goods and services prices.  These measures continue to give mixed signals about the direction of domestic inflationary pressure (see  Chart 4.11). 4.6 Other price indices The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), which is directly comparable with the harmonised inflation measures of other EU Member States, differs from RPIX in its coverage and method of construction.(1) HICP inflation stood at 1.4% in June, compared with 0.9% in the euro area.  The gap between UK and  euro-area inflation has widened in recent months, but it remains narrower than in the second half of 1998 (see Chart 4.12).    Annual growth in the GDP deflator at market prices, a quarterly measure of whole-economy inflation, fell to 1.8% in 1999 Q1, from 1.9% in 1998 Q4.  An alternative, monthly measure of whole-economy inflation has been developed on an experimental basis by the ONS, called the ‘Final Expenditure Price Index’ (FEPI).  Whole-economy inflation as measured by the FEPI was close to 2.0% in the past three quarters.  One way in which the FEPI differs from the GDP deflator is in its coverage of the external sector, since it is a deflator for final domestic expenditure rather than gross domestic product.  The FEPI thus excludes export prices but implicitly includes import prices, whereas the GDP deflator includes export prices and excludes import prices.  Correspondingly, any difference in inflation as measured by the two indices may be affected by movements in the terms of trade, ie the ratio of export prices to import prices.  Annual growth in the terms of trade has been positive since 1996 Q3, when sterling began to appreciate.  Hence annual growth in the FEPI in each quarter has tended to be lower than inflation as measured by the GDP deflator, though other compositional differences between the two indices  meant that in 1999 Q1 the reverse was true (see  Chart 4.13).

Inflation Report:  August 1999 38 4.7 Summary RPIX inflation fell below target in 1999 Q2, and was lower than projected in the May Report.  Import prices and earnings growth were both lower than expected. Retail services price inflation was stable in Q2, and survey measures suggest that producer price inflation in the service sector eased.  But there were signs that the rate of decline in manufacturing producer prices moderated in Q2, and that import prices may have stopped falling in recent months.  After declining further than expected in the early part of the year, prices for non-oil commodities have stabilised in recent months, according to the Bank’s commodity price index.  Non-oil commodity prices are expected to rise in the second half of 1999 and beyond, as global demand strengthens. Some of the recent sharp increases in oil prices may not be sustained, but the MPC now assumes that a higher oil price will prevail over the next two years than was assumed in the May Report.  Hence although RPIX inflation is projected to remain below target in the short term, some external factors that have been exerting downward pressure on inflation may soon cease to do so.

The minutes of the May, June and July meetings are attached as an Annex to this Report.  The Bank of England’s official dealing rate was reduced from 5.25% to 5% in June, and was maintained at that level in July and August. The MPC’s central projection in the May Report was for GDP growth to pick up to around trend by mid 2000, with the risks broadly balanced around this central case. The central projection was for RPIX inflation to fall slightly below target over the next year or so, before rising to around 2.5% at the two-year forecast horizon. On the assumption that the exchange rate was likely to fall by more than implied by interest rate differentials, the balance of risks to inflation was judged to be on the upside.  But some Committee members saw greater downside risks to inflation from a stronger exchange rate profile, weaker world activity and prices, and greater pressure on margins, than in the central projection.  The Report noted that, if sterling did not fall as assumed in the central projection, then, depending on other developments in the economy, further easing of monetary policy might be required to prevent undershooting of the inflation target.  At its meeting on 9–10 June, the Committee noted that sterling had been volatile over the month, but had on average remained at broadly the same value as at the time of the May Committee meeting, and somewhat above the level implied in the central assumption of the May Report.  The Committee discussed the possible reasons for sterling’s movements against the major currencies. The Committee agreed that the latest data on demand and output had been broadly consistent with the May central projection, but household consumption in Q1 had been a little stronger, and net trade a little weaker, than anticipated.  House price inflation had picked up and surveys of consumer and business confidence had continued to improve, although contacts of the Bank’s regional Agents reported a more fragile recovery in sentiment.  The National Accounts measure of  Inflation Report:  August 1999 40 companies’ operating profits had fallen sharply in Q1, but much of this appeared to reflect a statistical adjustment and was therefore more than usually uncertain. The Committee discussed developments in costs and prices.  RPIX inflation appeared to be running below expectations.  World commodity prices had picked up somewhat, but indicators of wage pressures remained mixed.  Earnings growth in the year to March, as measured by the Average Earnings Index, had been in line with the May Report.  Private sector settlements had fallen in April, but public sector settlements had risen, reflecting the implementation of the pay review body awards.   The Committee considered the arguments for a reduction in the repo rate.  Sterling had been stronger than the path incorporated in the May Report.  If this persisted, inflation would be more likely to fall below target than had been projected in May.  Private sector wage settlements had continued to fall, and RPIX inflation had been slightly weaker than projected.  Surveys of households and businesses, and evidence from the Bank’s regional Agents, suggested that the recovery in confidence was not yet robust.  On another view, however, there was no convincing case for a cut in the repo rate.  The value of sterling on the day of the meeting was not very different from that assumed in the May central projection.  News on developments in the domestic and world economies was broadly neutral or slightly positive.  And the fall in RPIX inflation had little implication for the projection two years out.  After weighing these arguments, the Committee voted to reduce the repo rate by 25 basis points to 5%. At its meeting on 7–8 July, the Committee noted that sterling had fallen a little over the month, and the effective exchange rate index was now close to the central assumption in the May Report.  Prospects for growth in the world economy had strengthened a little. Forward-looking activity indicators in some euro-area countries had picked up, and US growth had remained robust, although arguably the uncertainties over the future path of the US economy had increased.  World commodity prices had continued to rise. The Committee agreed that the news on domestic activity over the previous month suggested that the projected recovery seemed to be under way, and was, if anything, a little faster than expected.  Final domestic  Monetary policy since the May Report 41 demand in Q1 had been revised up;  consumption growth in particular now looked rather higher than had been expected, even after adjusting for special factors. Employment had continued to grow, and the possibility of a substantial rise in unemployment appeared to have diminished.  Estimates based on surveys and other published data suggested that GDP growth in Q2 could be marginally higher than envisaged in the May central projection.  The Committee noted that, though activity appeared to have strengthened a little, recent data on prices and wages had been somewhat weaker than anticipated in the May Report.  RPIX inflation had fallen, and nominal private sector pay growth appeared to be slowing. Possible reasons for this weakness were discussed. The Committee considered its immediate policy decision.  The exchange rate had eased slightly, and the outlook for domestic and international activity had improved somewhat since the previous meeting.  But price indicators had been weaker than expected.  A key question for policy was whether these movements would prove to be temporary or persistent.  This would need to be considered more thoroughly as part of the August Inflation Report round, when more data would also be available to help assess the likely direction of future price pressures.  In the light of these considerations, the Committee voted to maintain the repo rate at 5%. At its meeting on 4–5 August, the Committee voted to leave the repo rate unchanged at 5%.  42 6 Prospects for inflation 6.1 The inflation projection assumptions The Committee approved this Report on 6 August.  It contains the Committee’s assessment of developments in the economy since May, and prospects for the medium term.  Charts 6.1 and 6.2 below show projections for GDP growth and RPIX inflation up to two years ahead, and the uncertainties surrounding them.(1) The projections assume that the Bank’s repo interest rate will remain unchanged at 5% during the next two years, and are conditioned on the assumptions described below. There has been a further moderate improvement in the prospects for world activity since the May Report. Growth in the United States has remained robust and the outlook for activity appears stronger than three months ago.  Output growth is expected to ease gradually, although the timing and extent of the slowdown remains difficult to gauge.  Business sentiment in the euro area has improved over the past three months, and there are more signs of a prospective recovery in growth.  And, while much of the unexpected growth in GDP in Japan in 1999 Q1 probably reflected temporary factors, the outlook nonetheless appears a little brighter.  Outside the major industrial countries, prospects for many emerging Asian and Latin American economies have improved over the past three months.  Taking these developments together, the MPC has made a further small upward revision to the central projection for global activity. Growth in UK-weighted export markets is now assumed to rise from almost 5% in 1999 to near 6% in 2000.  But, as in recent projections, UK exports are likely to grow less quickly than export markets in the short term, as the effects of the past appreciation of sterling continue to filter through. There are a number of risks to the world outlook.  For example, the US economy could slow more rapidly than projected, should asset prices fall and domestic demand growth falter.  Trade imbalances among the major economies have widened further.  Fragilities remain in some emerging markets.  Interest rate spreads on emerging market debt over US Treasuries have edged up (1) A box assessing the MPC’s inflation forecasting record is appended on page 55.  Prospects for inflation 43 since the May Report.  So, although the Committee has raised the central projection for world activity, risks around this projection are judged to be weighted to the downside. Although world activity in the early months of the year was stronger than expected in the May Report, inflationary pressures were somewhat weaker.  Non-oil commodity prices were lower in the first quarter than assumed three months ago.  Moreover, the price of manufactured export goods continued to fall,  against earlier expectations of a slight rise.   Lower-than-expected world inflation was reflected in UK import prices falling by more than projected in  May. The period of falling world prices may, however, be coming to an end.  The prices of some important non-oil commodities have risen in recent months—and commodity-related equities and currencies are signalling upward pressure on prices.  Drawing on information from external forecasts, the central projection is based  on an assumption that non-oil commodity prices gradually recover from their low point in the first half of 1999.  Oil prices have been stronger than expected in the May Report, as market conditions have tightened.  The central assumption for the oil price has consequently been increased by $2 per barrel to around $17 per barrel for Brent crude, although the Committee also noted that the Brent price has risen above $19 per barrel in recent weeks and that there was a risk that this higher level could be sustained.  As world activity strengthens and higher commodity prices gradually feed through, prices of traded goods and services may start to edge up.  The rise in world prices from now on may be a little stronger than assumed in the May projection, given the improved outlook for activity.  But any pick-up is likely to remain modest, given excess capacity in the production of some key manufactured goods and commodities at the global level.  The rise will, moreover, be from a lower  starting-level.  The outlook for UK import prices will be affected by the changing profile for world prices as well as by the prospects for the sterling exchange rate. The sterling exchange rate, as measured by the effective exchange rate index (ERI), averaged 103.1 in the  15 working days up to and including 4 August.  This forms the starting-point for the exchange rate profile assumed in the projection.  It compares with a  starting-point of 104.0 at the time of the May Report and is slightly below the implied level of 103.4 for August.  Inflation Report:  August 1999 44 As in previous Reports, assumptions about the path of sterling in the central projection are linked to the pattern of market interest rate differentials—in turn adjusted for the conventional forecast assumption that UK interest rates are held constant.  On this basis, the sterling ERI declines to 96.6 by the end of the two-year forecast period, consistent with bilateral sterling exchange rates of about $1.56 and 0.71 against the euro (equivalent to DM 2.75).  That is a steeper decline than in May.  Risks around this central projection are assumed to be symmetric.    There are, however, differences of view within the Committee on the appropriate conditioning assumption for the exchange rate path.  Some Committee members preferred an alternative approach, consistent with the random walk hypothesis, of assuming a constant nominal exchange rate at the current level as the basis for the central projection.  On this alternative assumption for the exchange rate, RPIX inflation would be  0.4 percentage points lower than in the central case at the two-year horizon and four-quarter GDP growth would be some 0.2 percentage points lower. The fiscal plans announced by the Chancellor in the March Budget were incorporated into the May projections.  These figures remain the basis for the August projections. Previous projections have already incorporated assumptions about the effects of the National Minimum Wage, the New Deal and the Working Time Directive. Recent outturns for earnings growth have been  lower than projected, which may indicate a  smaller-than-expected impact from the National Minimum Wage.  More evidence is needed.  The Committee has, however, removed the upside risk of a larger effect than in the central projection.  There is no change to the other assumptions about the effects of labour market reforms. 6.2 The medium-term inflation projection Output growth has resumed in recent months. According to the preliminary GDP release in late July, output rose by 0.5% in the second quarter, after two quarters in which the level of economic activity was broadly flat.  The recent pick-up was a little faster than projected in May, suggesting that the recovery in activity may be gaining momentum more quickly than judged three months ago.  The level of activity has also been revised up since the spring of last year.  However, the  Prospects for inflation 45 implications for the medium-term inflation outlook are uncertain.  For, although growth may be strengthening a little more rapidly than earlier projected, and from a higher base, short-run inflationary pressures have been weaker than expected three months ago.  The Committee has revised its projections for activity and inflation against this background.   Detailed information on the composition of expenditure and output is only available up to the first quarter of this year.  Preliminary estimates were published by the ONS in May and June, but full data only became available in late July with the National Accounts Blue Book release. As well as completing the picture for the first quarter, this release incorporated revisions to the level and composition of activity for the past two years.  The cumulative effect of revisions up to 1999 Q1 raised the level of GDP at constant market prices by 0.4%, with most of the revisions to the level of GDP and its components occurring in 1998.  Domestic demand proved stronger than previously estimated, with upward revisions to consumer spending and fixed investment, partly counterbalanced by a downward revision to the volume of government consumption.  The upward revisions to GDP are of the same order of magnitude as the cumulative downward adjustments made in February and March.  The Committee revisited its earlier discussion on the possible implications for future inflation of the revisions to output.  Echoing that discussion, the Committee concluded that the data revisions were not sufficiently large to warrant a material change to the inflation outlook. The National Accounts release confirmed that overall GDP was essentially flat around the turn of the year, in line with the May projection.  The composition of demand was rather different, however.  Final domestic demand rose by 1.1% in the first quarter, much more strongly than projected, as consumer spending increased sharply.  Stronger-than-expected final domestic demand was not reflected in higher overall activity, however, as firms took the opportunity to correct stock levels more rapidly than earlier judged, and as net trade weakened by more than projected.  But the combination of stronger final domestic demand and a reduction of the inventory overhang is consistent with a faster pick-up in activity in the second quarter and thereafter. The interest rate cuts since October have affected consumer sentiment and behaviour in recent months. Even so, consumer spending has strengthened more  Inflation Report:  August 1999 46 rapidly than expected three months ago.  Spending rose sharply in the first quarter from a higher-than-expected level at the end of 1998.  Although the rapid growth in the first quarter partly reflected a change in the seasonal pattern of purchases of new cars, the underlying picture was of much higher expenditure than projected in the May Report.  More timely indicators are consistent with a stronger outturn for consumer spending in recent months as well.  Retail sales volumes rose by almost 1% in the second quarter.  Consumer confidence indicators have improved further, although the GfK indicator dropped back to April levels in July.  Narrow money is rising quickly.  Personal lending growth has picked up further and mortgage approvals continue to rise sharply. The housing market is clearly strengthening, providing a further signal of improving consumer sentiment. The MPC re-examined the prospects for consumer spending given these developments.  Previous Reports had noted that the initial estimates of consumer spending last year had turned out weaker than expected, given the pattern of other variables such as labour income, wealth, interest rates and unemployment.  In previous projections, part of the unexplained weakness had been assumed to persist into the future.  But the recent evidence suggested that this adjustment was not warranted:  the upward revision to consumer spending in 1998, together with the strength of expenditure in early 1999, had brought consumption growth into line with the rates expected on the basis of average historical experience.  The Committee consequently removed the earlier adjustment, raising the projected profile for consumer spending.  The Committee also decided to revise upwards the central projection for house price inflation:  house prices are now assumed to rise at around double the pace of earnings over the next two years.  Faster growth in housing wealth is likely to provide a further moderate boost to the consumer spending outlook.  The Committee judged that the risks to the consumption profile were on the upside over the next twelve to eighteen months. Inventory investment in both the final quarter of 1998 and the first quarter of 1999 was weaker than projected in May, as firms took advantage of robust final demand to correct excess stock levels.  Recent surveys have suggested that there may have been further adjustment in the second quarter, but that stock levels are now more closely aligned with desired levels than they were a year ago.  Against the background of improved cyclical balance, the Committee reviewed its assumption on the  Prospects for inflation 47 secular trend in the stock-output ratio.  As in previous projections, the Committee judged that further reductions in the ratio were likely, as firms continue to invest in improved stock management techniques, but, drawing on disaggregated analysis and international evidence, the MPC decided to assume a slower pace of decline than before. Business investment continued to rise quickly, underpinned by very strong growth in service sector investment.  Whole-economy investment growth in the first quarter was weaker than projected, however, as public investment fell sharply.  The timing of public investment is rather erratic, and the underspend at the end of the previous financial year is assumed to be spent in the current financial year.  Overall, there has been little change to the outlook for investment. Net trade continued to depress overall GDP growth in Q1, as import growth remained strong, while export volumes fell.  Rapid growth in domestic demand and the strength of sterling have continued to boost imports.  But export growth stalled as global demand growth slowed last year and as UK firms lost share in foreign markets. Although net exports were a little weaker than expected in the first quarter, prospects for the next two years have improved a little.  Stronger world trade growth and a slightly softer exchange rate profile are the main reasons. The changes overall are relatively small, however, and the central projection remains that net exports will on average detract from GDP growth in both 1999 and 2000, but at a declining rate. Overall, the Committee considers that the outlook for economic activity has strengthened since May.  Faster growth in consumer spending and a slower pace of inventory adjustment should boost domestic demand. And the improvement in the outlook for the international economy has raised prospective export growth. Data revisions have raised recent estimates of the  four-quarter growth rate of GDP.  The central projection is for the four-quarter growth rate of GDP at constant market prices to continue to rise as domestic demand growth strengthens, and it may return to assumed trend rates by the end of this year, rather earlier than in the May projection (see Chart 6.1).(1) The four-quarter growth rate continues to rise thereafter before levelling off at around 3%, as world trade growth is assumed to flatten.

Inflation Report:  August 1999 48 Survey evidence from business and households is consistent with the picture of rising growth in the central projection.  Agents’ contacts also report gradually improving sentiment, although to a lesser extent than some of the surveys.  The Agents also report that clear differences remain between sectors and regions, with stronger performance in the service sector and in the south of England. Recent data for the labour market are also consistent with an improvement in business confidence.  Labour demand has been rather stronger than earlier projected. Employment on the LFS measure has continued to rise, and unemployment on both the LFS and claimant count estimates has edged down further.  There now seems little likelihood of a substantial fall in overall employment in the coming months. Although the recovery in activity appears more firmly entrenched than three months ago, news on nominal outturns since May suggests that recent inflationary pressures were again weaker than earlier judged.  Import prices were lower than projected.  Nominal earnings growth also slowed against expectations.  Moreover, RPIX inflation in the second quarter was 0.2 percentage points below the central projection in the May Report. Forward-looking nominal indicators provide mixed signals.  Official interest rates are lower than in May, although money-market rates over the short-to-medium term have risen substantially.  Narrow money has accelerated.  Moreover, while broad money growth has slowed, the recent trend has been largely accounted for by movements in financial company deposits, which may have little immediate implication for nominal demand.  Divisia money growth is flat.  And credit growth has picked up further, particularly to households. After declining sharply over the past twelve months, surveys of inflation expectations over the next two years are little changed since the May Report. Pay pressures have weakened in recent months in nominal terms.  Earnings growth in the private sector has slowed sharply according to the Average Earnings Index and the Reward Index.  Private sector settlements are typically running well below levels of a year earlier. Although public sector settlements and earnings growth have increased following the implementation of the pay review body recommendations, private sector influences dominate at the whole-economy level.  Headline average earnings growth slowed to 4.3% in May, some  0.5 percentage points lower than in March.  Prospects for inflation 49 Lower price inflation provides part of the explanation for slower growth in nominal earnings.  Inflation expectations have fallen sharply over the past year.  For example, the Barclays Basix survey of inflation expectations for the next twelve months held by trade unions has fallen by 0.8 percentage points over the past year.  RPIX inflation has slipped below the target.  And inflation on the headline RPI measure has dropped to 1.3% in June, a fall of more than 2 percentage points over the past twelve months, as lower interest rates have reduced mortgage interest payments.  The gap between RPI and RPIX inflation will begin to close unless there are further reductions in interest rates, but the sharp fall in RPI inflation may have had a temporary effect on wage settlements, over and above the effects of lower inflation expectations and RPIX inflation outturns on settlements. Real earnings growth has continued to rise on a number of measures.  Nonetheless, real earnings growth has been rather weaker than expected three months ago, at a time when the labour market has been rather stronger than projected. The Committee reviewed the evidence for a change in the relationship between real earnings growth and the degree of tightness in the labour market.  Reforms to the labour market over a number of years, such as the tightening of eligibility to claim benefits and the reduction in the power and membership of trade unions, may have lowered the rate of unemployment at which inflationary pressures start to increase.  Although the evidence was hard to read and subject to significant uncertainty, the Committee decided that the recent earnings data were consistent with some improvement in the structure of the labour market.  An adjustment to the central projection was made to reflect this, lowering the outlook for real earnings growth for a given level of unemployment.  The revision of this assumption has contributed to lower nominal earnings growth in the near term than in the May projection, but the stronger outlook for activity and for import prices push in the opposite direction, and are more dominant by the end of the  two-year period.  Risks around the new central projection for earnings were judged by the Committee to be on the upside.   All members agreed that there was considerable uncertainty surrounding the prospects for earnings, and that it was particularly difficult to form quantified judgments on the potential implications of the improved  Inflation Report:  August 1999 50 functioning of the labour market for the inflationary outlook.  Some Committee members preferred a smaller adjustment than in the central projection and thought that real earnings growth could be stronger;  other Committee members preferred a larger adjustment and a weaker earnings profile.  Depending on the alternative view taken, RPIX inflation could be around  0.2 percentage points higher or lower at the two-year horizon. Productivity growth tempers the impact of earnings on firms’ unit costs.  The preliminary estimate for GDP growth and partial LFS data suggest that  whole-economy productivity may have risen in the second quarter, the first sign of a reversal of the pattern of weakening productivity growth over recent quarters as activity growth slowed.  A turnaround in productivity was expected as the cyclical recovery in activity gathered pace.  The Committee has maintained the assumptions from the May forecast that productivity growth per hour will return to its long-run historical average over the next two years, and that structural changes in labour market performance have reduced the variability of productivity over the cycle.  Productivity per person will pick up more rapidly than productivity per hour, as average working time lengthens in the cyclical recovery. RPIX inflation fell to 2.3% in the second quarter, around 0.2 percentage points lower than projected in the May Report.  Goods prices have been particularly weak.  The overprediction can be largely accounted for by weaker import prices and lower-than-expected earnings growth and labour costs.  Preliminary estimates of price-cost margins appear to be broadly in line with expectations, and so no fundamental change was made to the assumptions incorporated in the previous projections.  A small downward adjustment was, however, made to the level of margins from 2000 Q2 onwards, to take account of the possibility of a more concentrated compression of margins in the water industry following the recent recommendations from OFWAT.  This adjustment has no effect on measured RPIX inflation by the end of the  two-year period.  Risks to the central projection for price-cost margins were viewed as symmetric.  Some Committee members considered that an intensification of competitive pressure, driven partly by regulatory developments and linked also to factors such as the impact of information technology on distribution channels, could lead to a structural reduction in the level of margins in some sectors.  In their opinion, this  Prospects for inflation 51 reduction could lower measured inflation as the adjustment took place by perhaps some 0.2 percentage points at the two-year horizon. The Committee’s best collective projection for the twelve-month RPIX inflation rate—based on the assumption that nominal interest rates are held constant at 5%—is shown in Chart 6.2.(1) Alongside is the projection from the May Report, which was based on constant interest rates at 5.25%. The broad shape of the current profile is similar to May. But there are a number of important differences.  The starting-point is lower than in May, as inflation has fallen more rapidly than expected.  Inflation is likely to remain below target for much of the forecast period. The trough in inflation may also be deeper as lower earnings growth reduces unit costs in the near term.  But over the medium term this is offset by a combination of upward pressures from stronger domestic and world activity, higher oil prices, rising world inflation, lower official interest rates and a weaker exchange rate.  In the central projection, inflation picks up to just above the target level by 2001 Q3. Risks around the central projection for activity growth are slightly on the upside in the first year, reflecting the possibility of faster consumer spending growth, but are weighted to the downside in the second year, reflecting the possibility of a weaker outlook for the world (1) Also shown as Chart 2 in the Overview.

The risks to inflation are weighted to the upside, particularly in the first year, reflecting the possibility of stronger consumer spending and of a smaller improvement in structural labour market performance and hence of higher earnings growth.  The downside risks to world activity in the second year provide a partial mitigation.  Charts 6.4 and 6.5 show the overall balance of risks to inflation at the two-year horizon.  Table 6.A presents the MPC’s best collective judgment of the probabilities of various outcomes for inflation and GDP growth.   There are a number of major uncertainties in the outlook, where difficult judgments have been made by the Committee to produce the projections.  On some issues, certain Committee members preferred to take a different view.  These are not incorporated explicitly in the fan charts or in Table 6.A, but are shown in a new Table 6.B. This table illustrates the possible effects on RPIX inflation and GDP growth of the alternative assumptions. These estimates themselves are highly uncertain and they should be viewed as broad calibrations rather than as definitive point estimates. There are four areas where different judgments were preferred by some members.  Some Committee members preferred to base the projection on the conditioning assumption of a constant nominal exchange rate.  That would weaken the outlook for activity and inflation Table 6.A The MPC’s expectations for RPIX inflation and GDP growth based on constant nominal interest rates(a) RPIX inflation Probability, per cent  Range: less  1.5% 2.0%  2.5%  3.0% more than  to  to  to  to  than 1.5% 2.0% 2.5% 3.0% 3.5% 3.5% 1999 Q4 <1 11 60 28 1 <1 2000 Q4 19 29 28 16 6 2 2001 Q3 7 14 22 24 18 15 GDP growth  Probability, per cent  Range: less  0%  1%  2%  3%  more  than  to  to  to  to  than  0% 1% 2% 3% 4% 4% 1999 Q4 <1 8 44 40 8 <1 2000 Q4 <1 4 17 36 30 13 2001 Q3 1 6 18 31 29 15 (a) These figures are from the same distributions as the GDP and inflation fan charts, Charts 6.1 and 6.2.  Prospects for inflation 53 relative to the central case:  RPIX inflation would be some 0.4 percentage points lower than otherwise at the two-year horizon and GDP growth would be around  0.2 percentage points lower.  Views also differed on wage pressures.  Some Committee members considered that pay pressures could be rather stronger than  reflected in the projection in Chart 6.2:  others took the opposite view and judged that earnings could be weaker than in the collective projection.  Depending on the view taken, the inflation profile would either be raised or lowered—by about 0.2 percentage points at the two-year horizon—but with little effect on the activity outlook. Some Committee members judged that there were downside risks to inflation from an intensification of competitive pressures which would reduce the level of profit margins.  Taking this alternative view, inflation could be around 0.2 percentage points lower than in the central projection at the two-year horizon.  Activity would be slightly higher.  Finally, some Committee members noted that the oil price had risen to over  $19 per barrel in recent weeks and preferred to base the projections on a higher oil price.  Basing the projection on a $19 per barrel oil price would increase RPIX inflation by around 0.2 percentage points at the two-year horizon. These assumptions are viewed by the Committee members as a series of separate judgments.  The net effect of the alternative assumptions preferred by different Committee members gave rise to a range of views about inflation prospects, illustrating the particular difficulties in judging the outlook for inflation in present circumstances.  Some Committee members preferred assumptions that would raise the inflation profile shown in Chart 6.2 by about 0.2 percentage points at the  two-year horizon.  Other Committee members preferred assumptions that would lower the profile shown in  Chart 6.2 by 0.2 to 0.6 percentage points after two  years. The market expectation of the likely path of interest rates has changed markedly since the May Report.  At close of business on 4 August, implied interest rates on  short-sterling futures contracts suggested that the market expectation was, on balance, for official interest rates to rise steadily over the next two years, reaching around 7% by 2001 Q3.  So the MPC’s projections under the assumption that official rates move in line with market expectations are for significantly weaker output growth and a much lower profile for inflation than in the constant interest rate case (see Charts 6.6 and 6.7).

Rows may not sum to 100 because of rounding. (b) 25 forecasters. 6.3 Other forecasts Chart 6.8 shows the distribution of central forecasts for the twelve-month rate of RPIX inflation in 2001 Q3, based on information from 25 forecasters surveyed by the Bank in late July.  The mean forecast for the year to 1999 Q4 was 2.1%, rising to 2.4% in 2000 Q4, and reaching 2.6% in 2001 Q3.  The estimate for 1999 is a little lower than the projection made at the time of the April survey, while the estimates for 2000 and 2001 are slightly higher.  The forecasters assign just over 50% probability to inflation being above the target in the third quarter of 2001, and just under 50% probability to it being below (see Table 6.C).  These estimates have changed slightly since the May Report, with further weight being placed on higher outturns for inflation. The forecasters’ average projection for GDP growth in the year to 1999 Q4 is 11/2% (with a range of projections from 1% to 21/2%), rising to 23/4% in the year to 2001 Q3 (with a range of 2% to 31/2%).  The estimate for 1999 Q4 is slightly higher than at the time of the May Report. The implications of the latest projections for the stance of monetary policy are discussed in the Overview at the beginning of this Report.  Prospects for inflation 55 Inflation projections are central to the conduct of monetary policy, because it takes time for interest rate changes to affect inflation;  empirical evidence suggests that their full impact may take up to two years.(1) So how have the MPC’s projections compared with inflation outturns? Two factors must be borne in mind when assessing the MPC’s forecasting record.  First, the MPC’s inflation projection takes the form of a probability distribution, not a point estimate, because of considerable statistical and economic uncertainty.(2) The question, then, is where in the probability distributions were the eventual outcomes?  A way of answering this is to compare the outcomes with the means (ie average outcomes) or modes (ie most likely outcomes) projected by the MPC.  Second, the MPC’s projections are conditioned on assumptions about economic variables such as interest rates and the exchange rate.  The accuracy of these assumptions will affect how the inflation projections compare with the outturns. The August 1997 Inflation Report contained the MPC’s first inflation projection.(3) Data are now available to compare that projection with outturns seven quarters ahead (ie for 1997 Q4 to 1999 Q2).  And the projections made in November 1997, February 1998 and May 1998 can be compared with outturns six, five and four quarters ahead, respectively.(4) The chart shows the paths of the mean RPIX inflation projections from those Reports, together with the actual outcomes.  Inflation has sometimes been higher, and sometimes lower, than the projected mean path.  On average, the outcome four quarters ahead was broadly in line with the projected mean.  However, the outturns were on average 0.2% higher than the projected modes, since the risks around the most likely outcome, or central projection, were generally on the upside. These one year ahead forecast errors are small relative to the errors made in Inflation Report forecasts from 1993 to  May 1997, ie prior to the MPC, with actual inflation turning out close to the centre of the fan charts.  But as yet there are a limited number of observations on which to assess the MPC’s inflation forecasting record, and over the past two years inflation outturns have on average been less variable than in previous years.  Nevertheless, it is important to understand why actual and projected inflation have differed. To what extent are the inflation forecast errors the result of the conditioning assumption of constant interest rates?  This assumption is not very important in explaining forecast errors over the one-year horizon for the four projections at hand, because the profile of actual interest rates has turned out relatively close to the constant interest rate assumption (except during 1999).  Only a small proportion of the overall RPIX inflation forecast errors can be explained by the difference between the constant interest rate assumption and the eventual outturn. What other factors might explain the inflation forecast errors?  The effective exchange rate has consistently turned out higher than the MPC had assumed based on interest rate differentials.  These errors in exchange rate assumptions, together with unexpected weakness in world traded goods prices, led to a systematic overprediction of import prices: the mean forecast error for four-quarter growth in import prices averaged more than 3 percentage points for the forecasts between August 1997 and February 1998. Accurate import prices on their own would not have helped the inflation projection;  indeed, predicted inflation would have been consistently lower than the outturns if future import prices had been predicted more accurately, other things remaining the same. In contrast to import prices, average earnings growth up to the one-year horizon was on average higher than expected over the four projections.  Although the errors are small relative to those on import prices, earnings growth has a larger direct effect on RPIX inflation.  But these two influences have not offset each other in a systematic way, resulting in some positive and some negative forecast errors. The MPC makes projections for GDP growth as well as for RPIX inflation.  There are no systematic errors in the one year ahead mean (and mode) GDP growth projections made by the MPC between August 1997 and May 1998.  However, domestic demand has consistently turned out higher than predicted.  This has been offset by weaker-than-expected net trade, reflecting the unanticipated strength of sterling and adverse external shocks, notably the crisis in Asia. It is too early to draw strong conclusions about the MPC’s inflation forecasting record, given the lags in the transmission of monetary policy, the prevalence of shocks, and the limited number of observations.  But there is no obvious evidence so far of large systematic errors.

The world economy 2 The Committee discussed whether there had been a material change in the world economic outlook, or in the balance of risks, since its February Inflation Report.  Overall, prospects had slightly improved.  In particular, US economic growth had again been strong, and was unaccompanied by manifest signs of rising inflation.  It now seemed likely that growth in 1999 would be higher than previously expected.  The longer the strength of demand persisted, the greater would be the risk of the economy hitting capacity constraints and inflationary pressures emerging. Unemployment was already significantly below the level previously generally thought to be consistent with stable inflation. Productivity growth had also risen above most previous estimates of its trend, despite the length of the current expansion.  The resulting uncertainty about the path of capacity output complicated US monetary policy.  If any eventual tightening therefore came as a surprise, there might be a larger reaction in financial markets, particularly given the continuing strength of the equity market.   The US outlook was a major area of uncertainty in the world economy. 3 Economic prospects in the euro area remained subdued, and were judged to be slightly weaker than in February.  While the  50 basis point reduction in official interest rates should help, business confidence indicators were still weak.  Despite some improvement in sentiment, the economic outlook in Japan continued to be uncertain. 4 Conditions in emerging market economies, taken as a whole, had improved somewhat in recent months.  This was evident in the yields on US$-denominated bonds issued by emerging market economy governments, which were on average down about  three percentage points relative to US Treasury bond yields since February.  The balance of forecasts for growth in Asia was up slightly, and conditions in Brazil seemed more stable than a month ago. 5 The Balkan conflict had already had economic repercussions in some neighbouring countries.  It added to uncertainties more widely, and on one view created a downside risk to world activity and prices, through negative effects on confidence if the situation remained unresolved or the conflict spread.  This was the kind of risk to which the Committee could if necessary react as developments occurred. Monetary and financial conditions 6 The Committee noted that its April reduction in interest rates had not yet been reflected fully in bank and building society rates. However, pass through of official rate changes had not always been immediate in the past, and it seemed unlikely that a greater than usual spread between private sector and official rates could be sustained for long. 7 Annual broad money growth had fallen to around 7%, almost entirely on account of reduced money holdings by the non-bank financial sector.  Assuming a trend fall in velocity of around 2% per year, aggregate monetary growth was broadly consistent with the inflation target and trend output growth. 8 Developments in bank lending to different sectors were quite varied.  In particular, the annual rate of growth in household credit had risen to about 8%, with secured lending up sharply.  Mortgage loan approvals were also strong.  Taken together with other signs of housing market momentum, this would need to be watched. 9 Equity prices had continued to rise, with the FT-SE All-Share Index up by over 10% since February.  The consequent boost to household wealth would tend to support consumption growth in the period ahead.  Private sector investment might also be more buoyant as a result. 10 A significant development in monetary and financial conditions was the further rise in sterling’s effective exchange rate. The ERI was up around 3% since the April meeting, and was around 5% higher than the level implied by February’s central projection.  It seemed that a material part, but not all, of this appreciation could be explained by relative yield curve movements, the sterling yield curve having risen and the euro area yield curve having fallen, reflecting changing market assessments of the outlook for growth and, thus, monetary policy settings.  Other market explanations included a change in the sterling/euro risk premium in sterling’s favour, possibly related in part to the Kosovo conflict, which appeared to be consistent with the slight appreciation in the euro when there had been news of intensified diplomatic efforts;  a possible longer-term rerating of relative UK economic prospects;  and increased merger and acquisition-related demand for sterling, although given the liquidity and depth of the foreign exchange market, it seemed unlikely that such transaction-related factors could have had anything more than a brief effect, whereas sterling’s rise had been sustained over three months. Demand and output 11 GDP growth in Q1 was now estimated to have been 0.1%;  it was probably slightly higher excluding energy industries.  Since the beginning of 1998 there had now been five consecutive quarters of below-trend growth.  That should have done a lot to relieve capacity pressures, although judgments could easily differ about the precise balance of aggregate demand and supply.  The economy was probably at or slightly past the trough in growth, which was set to recover towards trend.   12 On the demand side, consumption growth now seemed to have been stronger in 1998 Q4 than had been thought in February. The evidence available so far suggested this had been maintained into 1999 Q1.  Consumer confidence had risen since February, and housing market indicators were showing signs of renewed strength. 13 The outlook for investment was stronger than a quarter ago, partly reflecting the marked recovery in measures of business confidence and partly the stronger than expected outturns in the second half of 1998.  At this early stage of the new monetary framework, it was difficult to know whether the recovery in confidence was the result of the apparently sharper than expected easing of monetary policy, or whether the available measures of business confidence were simply volatile, and perhaps at times misleading, indicators. 14 There were suggestions from the Bank’s regional Agents that the recovery in confidence was fragile.  It was not possible to substantiate this, but it seemed likely that any recovery in Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 5–6 May 1999  Inflation Report:  August 1999 60 manufacturing sector sentiment would remain weak while sterling’s strength persisted.  And it was possible that household sector confidence would be vulnerable to any significant increase in unemployment. 15 As discussed at the Committee’s previous meeting, the counterpart to the upward revision to domestic demand growth in 1998 Q4 had been a larger trade deficit.  Although this was likely to increase, the current account deficit was likely to be smaller in relation to GDP, partly on account of strong net income on overseas investments. Labour market conditions 16 As had been the case for some time, labour market indicators painted a mixed picture.  On the one hand, nominal settlements were lower, and the Reward index of nominal earnings growth was still slowing.  On the other hand, the Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services had reported a slight increase in pay rates in April;  and according to the revised January Average Earnings Index and the first February estimate, nominal earnings growth had stopped falling.  Nominal earnings growth had in fact fallen by less than most measures of expected inflation, suggesting that expected real earnings growth might have risen.  There were two reasons why wage drift—the gap between nominal earnings growth and settlements—might have increased.  First, firms might be awarding any pay increases needed to comply with the National Minimum Wage rules outside the normal pay round.  Second, there might have been an increase in bonuses, but this was difficult to judge as the ONS’s question about bonuses had recently changed, so that there was a break in the series. 17 The labour market remained tight.  Employment had been increasing even though output growth had been below trend for the past 15 months or so.  Measured by headcount, employment had continued to rise recently, although by less in 1999 Q1 than in  1998 Q4.  Taken at face value, this might suggest that the labour market was still tightening.  However, part of the increase was accounted for by a rise in the number of part-time workers. Overtime hours had fallen.  Overall, hours worked per head had also fallen.  Unemployment had risen slightly, but was still close to a 20 year low.  According to the latest British Chambers of Commerce survey, employment intentions were less positive in services and flat in manufacturing.  Evidence on skill shortages and recruitment difficulties had also suggested some easing, but the picture was not clear. 18 Taking all the evidence together, the Committee judged that nominal earnings growth would be lower in the remainder of 1999 and in 2000 than had been expected in February, partly due to the sustained fall in inflation expectations. Prices 19 Although the Bank’s index of non-oil commodity prices had fallen 3% in the year to March, the twelve-month rate of decline was now much lower than throughout 1998 and into 1999, and the index had risen by 2% during March itself.  Oil prices continued to rise, reflecting supply policy changes.  It had been suggested that some commodity prices had fallen close to marginal production costs, making it unlikely that prices would continue to fall. 20 Manufacturing input prices (excluding food, beverages, tobacco and petrol) had been flat in March, but were still down 41/2% on a year ago.  Manufacturing output prices (excluding food, beverages, tobacco and petrol) were also flat. 21 Overall, it seemed likely that the downward pressure on RPIX inflation of falling world commodity prices would come to an end during the two-year forecast period.  The RPIX inflation rate had spiked up in March due to the timing of the introduction of various Budget measures.  It was expected to fall back in April. The May inflation and growth projections 22 The Committee agreed the projections to be published in the Inflation Report on 12 May. 23 On the assumption of constant official interest rates of 5.25%, the central projection for output growth rose to around the economy’s trend rate of growth by the middle of 2000.  The risks were broadly balanced. 24 The central projection for inflation was broadly in line with the target over the forecast period.  It fell slightly below target for the next year or so, principally on account of sterling’s recent appreciation and the lower assumed path for earnings growth;  and then rose to about 21/2% at the two year horizon, as demand strengthened and the effects of sterling’s appreciation wore off. 25 The central projection assumed that sterling’s effective exchange rate would depreciate in line with uncovered interest rate parity (ie interest rate differentials).  If sterling was likely to fall by more than this, as indicated by most outside forecasts, the balance of risks to inflation was on the upside.  That was the view of a majority of the Committee.  Some members judged, however, that the balance of risks to inflation was on the downside because they thought sterling was likely to be in line with or stronger than the path assumed in the central projection, and also saw downside risks from weaker than assumed world activity and prices, and from greater pressure on margins. Other considerations relevant to the policy decision 26 The Committee discussed a range of other issues relevant to its policy decision. 27 How much weight should the Committee place on the central projection for inflation being slightly below target for the next year or so but roughly at target, and rising, at the two year horizon?  A number of possible arguments were identified.  First, the central projection’s saucer shape was largely attributable to sterling’s recent appreciation, the effects of which would be temporary. Second, the Committee could consider whether there was a path for policy that could underpin activity growth in the relatively short run while not endangering achievement of the inflation target at and beyond the forecast horizon;  this might be achieved by a temporary reduction in interest rates.  Third, it was possible that the new monetary framework had altered expectations and thus the speed of the transmission mechanism, with shorter lags from changes in policy to the effects on output and inflation.  Views varied on these issues. 28 What did the recent strength of sterling imply for policy? Sterling’s renewed appreciation presented a dilemma for policy.  It had exacerbated the imbalances in the economy, given the already considerable pressures on exporters and producers competing domestically with imports.  The implications for inflation, and thus for monetary policy, depended on the reasons for the appreciation. To the extent that it reflected changed perceptions of the outlook for UK monetary policy, policy should respond only if market expectations were materially wrong.  Otherwise, depending on the effect on interest rate expectations, reducing official interest rates now might increase expected inflation.  The Committee had agreed, however, that relative yield curve movements did not explain the whole of sterling’s recent rise, which would therefore tend to put downward pressure on inflation in the near term.  In principle, the forecast process should identify and quantify the various influences on sterling, but this assessment was inevitably imprecise. 29 Given the dilemma for policy created by sterling’s rise, the Committee noted that it could, in principle, use two other instruments.  The first was a statement explaining the part played by sterling in its eventual policy decision.  This option was available whatever the decision on interest rates.  Monetary Policy Committee 61 30 The second was foreign exchange intervention.  A range of views was expressed.  It was possible that combining a reduction in interest rates and a statement with publicly-announced intervention might help to underline the Committee’s concerns about the exchange rate.  The Committee did not believe that intervention could materially affect the balance between demand and supply in the foreign exchange market;  rather it would help to underline the Committee’s view about the implications of sterling’s strength. However, given that sterling currently seemed well supported in the market, it was not possible to be confident that intervention would have the desired effect, and it could possibly have a perverse effect. It was also important not to confuse the market about the role of the exchange rate in the Committee’s analysis and reaction function, which were geared to the inflation target. The immediate policy decision 31 On one view, there was not yet a convincing case for a further reduction in interest rates.  First, the balance of news over the month had been broadly neutral.  While sterling had risen in the past month, part of that reflected the stronger outlook for UK output growth.  Moreover, mortgage credit growth and approvals and other housing market indicators were stronger;  there was more evidence that the trough in output growth had been passed, so that the outlook was now more for a ‘gentle take off’ than ‘a soft landing’;  the labour market was apparently still tight, although the evidence was mixed and hard to assess;  and the falls in commodity and import prices seemed to be coming to an end.  Second, the inflation forecast, which incorporated all the news over the quarter including sterling’s sharp rise, did not decisively point to an interest rate reduction.  Two years out, the central projection (the mode) was near the target but rising, and with the balance of risks on the upside.  If rates were to be reduced by a further 25 basis points, both the mode and the mean would be above the target at two years. Thus, any immediate reduction in rates would probably be short-lived, especially if sterling fell back, as assumed in the projections.  Third, it was important not to create confusion about how the Committee analysed and responded to exchange rate changes.  There were dangers in appearing to change interest rates in response to high frequency movements in the exchange rate.  In particular, it would be highly undesirable if the market reached the mistaken conclusion that the Committee had a simple rule of thumb for trading off interest rate changes against exchange rate changes. A further reduction in interest rates could not be ruled out if the risks of undershooting the inflation target increased.  But it would be better to see more evidence on the position of the labour market and on domestic inflationary pressures generally, and whether sterling’s strength persisted.  A statement explaining that policy might need to be eased further if sterling remained so high would therefore be useful. 32 On a second view there was a clearer case for an immediate further reduction of 25 basis points.  The central projection was below target throughout the forecast period.  Moreover, contrary to the majority view as reflected in the Inflation Report fan chart, the balance of risks to inflation was on the downside.  There were not good grounds for expecting sterling to fall by more than implied by interest rate differentials—on the contrary it was plausible that it would remain strong given the range of factors supporting it;  the risks to world activity and prices were on the downside;  and there could be greater pressure on margins than assumed in the central projection.  The current stance of policy was still restrictive.  A statement connecting a cut to sterling’s strength would also be desirable, possibly combined with intervention. 33 In the view of most members of the Committee, the arguments were finely balanced between no change and a small reduction.  The projection did not require a further cut in interest rates but would not be inconsistent with one.  The judgment was therefore partly a matter of tactics, and centred on the best approach to addressing the problems with the balance of the economy created by sterling’s strength, consistent with achieving the inflation target. Arguments identified for an immediate cut were as follows. Inflation was projected to be below target throughout the forecast period.  The risks of undershooting in the relatively near term were greater than of overshooting further out, especially if the new monetary framework had increased the speed of the transmission mechanism.  Given the saucer shape of the projection, with inflation rising through and beyond the second year, delay could mean losing the opportunity for a future reduction, and could therefore risk denting confidence, which in some sectors remained fragile.  It would also be easier this month to explain the role played by the exchange rate in a decision to reduce rates, given that the Inflation Report was being published the following week;  the Report could explain the Committee’s analysis of the recent appreciation and make clear that there was no simple rule of thumb relating changes in the exchange rate and interest rates.  That might be less easy in a non-Inflation Report month.  Arguments identified against reducing rates, in addition to those summarised in paragraph 31, were as follows.  There was not a pressing need to take further action at present to underpin output given that it was projected to recover towards trend, and it was in any case possible that some easing of conditions would come from sterling declining, as projected, at least in line with interest rate differentials.  A cut now might therefore mean that rates had to be increased quite soon. In principle there should be no problems with that.  But given the still incomplete understanding of the Committee’s monetary policy reaction function, such a reversal might adversely affect sentiment. The uncertainties about the effects of a further reduction might also warrant caution.  Whether or not rates were reduced, a statement drawing out the implications of the exchange rate for policy would be useful.  If rates were left unchanged, the statement could explain that if sterling were to remain so strong then, depending on other developments in the economy, interest rates might have to be reduced in order to reduce the risks of undershooting the target.  It was also argued by some that the case for a reduction would be stronger if it could sensibly be accompanied by foreign exchange intervention as well as a statement.  If, however, the case for intervention could not effectively be made in current market circumstances, which was the view of some members, then the argument for an immediate reduction was weaker. 34 The Governor invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate be maintained at 5.25%.  Five members of the Committee (the Governor, Mervyn King, Alan Budd, Charles Goodhart and John Vickers) voted for the proposition.  Four members of the Committee (David Clementi, Willem Buiter, DeAnne Julius and Ian Plenderleith) voted against, preferring a reduction of 25 basis points. 35 The following members were present: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Alan Budd Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers 36 Gus O’Donnell was present as the Treasury representative.  Inflation Report:  August 1999 62 1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by the Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee on 30 April, in advance of its meeting on 5–6 May 1999.  At the start of the Committee meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and that information is included in the Annex. I The international economy 2 Consensus Economics’ forecasts for GDP growth in 1999 had continued to be revised up for the United States, and down for Germany and Japan.  G3 nominal effective exchange rates had moved little since the MPC’s previous meeting, though the euro had weakened further, and the volatility of the yen had decreased. 3 According to the advance estimate of US GDP in 1999 Q1, quarterly GDP growth had slowed to 1.1% from 1.5% in 1998 Q4. Domestic demand had risen by 1.8%, largely due to strong consumption.  Consumer confidence had increased further in April, suggesting that strong consumption growth would continue.  Net exports had fallen in Q1, partly reflecting the unwinding of special factors that had boosted net exports in Q4.  Industrial production had risen by only 0.1% in March, though the NAPM index of industrial confidence had remained strong, and durable goods orders had increased by 2.0% in March.  Housing market activity had continued to be robust, though house price inflation remained moderate.  Employment cost growth had decreased in 1999 Q1, and consumer price inflation had remained subdued, despite a further fall in the unemployment rate to 4.2% in March.  Since the previous MPC meeting there had been a rise in market expectations of US interest rates and in government bond yields.  And though equity prices had initially fallen, they had since recovered strongly.  US broad money growth had continued to slow. 4 In the euro area, recent data releases had confirmed that GDP had risen by 0.2% in 1998 Q4.  The twelve-month growth rate of industrial production had continued to slow in February, and business confidence had fallen again.  Consumer confidence had also fallen in the euro area, particularly in Germany.  Germany’s six Institutes had revised down their forecasts for German growth. Euro-area broad money growth had remained steady, but narrow money growth had risen strongly.  This could only partly be explained by the effect of lower interest rates on money holdings in some smaller countries.  Euro-area price inflation had continued to be subdued, albeit with substantial differentials between member countries.  The ECB had reduced interest rates by 50 basis points on April 8, though short-term euro-area interest rates had fallen by less, as the markets had already priced in much of the ECB’s rate cut.  Long rates had also fallen. 5 The Bank of Japan had maintained the overnight call rate at 3 basis points, and rates on longer-term instruments had continued to decline.  Low overnight rates had resulted in funds being withdrawn from the call market, which might have explained the rise in deposit money (up 9.4% in the year to March).  After rising in 1998, the growth of cash in circulation appeared to have stabilised, and the risk premium on Japanese interbank borrowing had fallen to near zero, possibly because of perceptions of increased financial market stability.  The annual rate of decline of bank lending and bankruptcies had continued to diminish, perhaps reflecting government policy measures aimed at small firms. However, the value of bankruptcies had reached a new monthly record in March, and unemployment had risen to 4.8%.  Inventory levels had continued to fall, and though industrial production had increased by 2.2% in March, most of this rise was offset by downward revisions to earlier months.  New construction orders had risen by 5% in the year to March, suggesting that the fiscal stimulus measures were taking effect.  But private demand had remained weak.  This, together with reduced imports of erratics, had resulted in continued falls in imports.  Consumer prices had fallen by 0.4% in the year to March. 6 Spreads on government bonds in emerging markets over  US Treasuries had continued to narrow over the month, and a number of major emerging market currencies had appreciated. Emerging market foreign currency financing had risen in 1999 Q1 owing to increased bond financing in Latin America and Asia. However, the Institute of International Finance had projected that total net external financing of emerging markets would fall in 1999 overall.  On balance though, Consensus Economics’ forecasts for emerging market growth had been revised up since February. II   Monetary and financial conditions 7 Notes and coin had grown by 0.7% in April (after adjusting for the introduction of the new £2 and 50 pence coins).  The strong flow pushed the twelve-month growth rate to 5.7%:  a seven-month high.  The three and six-month annualised growth rates were both higher than the twelve-month growth rate. 8 M4 had grown by £2.9 billion in March.  The twelve-month growth rate was 6.9%, the lowest since June 1995. 9 M4 lending had increased by £6.7 billion in March, though this strong growth had been in part affected by temporary lending (£1 billion) to the company handling the securitisation of part of the Student Loans book.  Excluding this effect, the twelve-month growth rate (excluding securitisations) had been 7.3% compared with 7.0% in February.  Despite the strong growth in March, the trend decline in M4 lending seen over the past six months seemed likely to continue:  the annualised three and six-month growth rates (6.6% and 6.0% respectively) remained below the twelve-month rate. 10 Households’ M4 had increased by £0.9 billion in March. The twelve-month growth rate had been 6.5%.  The annualised three-month growth rate for 1999 Q1 had been 3.8%:  the lowest since 1994 Q2.  The weakness in the first quarter may in part have reflected the increased concentration of income tax payments in that quarter following the introduction of self-assessment. Additionally, the March figure had been depressed by an outflow of funds into PEPs:  retail unit trust sales had totalled a record  £1.8 billion (seasonally adjusted).  Households’ M4 lending had grown by £3.9 billion in March.  Total lending to individuals (excluding lending to unincorporated businesses, but including lending by a number of non-M4 institutions) had increased by  £4.4 billion (0.8%) in March, reflecting a strong increase in secured lending. 11 Private Non-Financial Corporations’ (PNFCs’) M4 had grown by £2.4 billion in March.  The strong growth in March was reflected in the figures for 1999 Q1.  The twelve-month growth rate in 1999 Q1 had been 9.2%, the highest since 1996 Q4.  PNFCs’ M4 lending had grown by £1.4 billion in March.  This flow had been somewhat stronger than the monthly average for 1999 Q1  (£0.9 billion).  PNFCs’ sterling capital market issues had risen from £2.4 billion in 1998 Q4 to £6.1 billion in 1999 Q1. 12 Other Financial Corporations’ (OFCs’) M4 had fallen by £0.5 billion in March.  The total flow in 1999 Q1 was -£3.1 billion, the first negative flow since 1993 Q2.  The twelve-month growth rate had fallen sharply in 1999 Q1 to 6.6%, compared with 15.6% in 1998 Q4.  OFCs’ M4 lending had increased by £1.3 billion in March, though this had been inflated by the temporary lending to Annex:  Summary of data presented by Bank staff  Monetary Policy Committee 63 the company handling the securitisation of part of the Student Loans book.  Even without adjusting for this lending, the twelve-month growth rate in 1999 Q1 had been 8.4%, less than half the 17.5% annual growth rate in 1998 Q1. 13 Turning to price indicators of monetary conditions, there had been little reaction of short-term interest rate expectations (as measured by the near-term short sterling futures contracts) to the  25 basis point reduction in the official repo rate on April 8. Nominal forward rates had increased over the period since the April MPC meeting, with the rise concentrated at the short end of the zero-coupon gilts yield curve.  Analysis of bank and building society variable interest rates indicated that the 25 basis point reduction in the official repo rate on 8 April had been only partially passed through to standard variable rate (SVR) mortgages and savings rates. 14 Implied real forward interest rates, derived from index-linked gilts, had risen on the month, particularly following the announcement of the results of the index-linked gilt auction on  28 April. 15 Turning to measures of inflation expectations, the rise in real forward rates had been reflected in a tick down in longer-term inflation forward rates, as derived by a comparison of yields on nominal and index-linked gilts.  Survey-based measures of RPIX inflation expectations were broadly unchanged at 2.2%–2.3% for 1999 and 2000.  Data from a Consensus Economics survey in April, measuring longer-term inflation expectations, showed that inflation expectations over the period 2001–04 had risen slightly since the previous survey in October 1998. 16 Equity indices had risen sharply in April with the FT-SE 100 and All-Share indices reaching new record highs, but they had fallen below their peak by the time of the May MPC meeting.  The FT-SE All-Share index had risen by 0.3% since the April MPC meeting and by 11.5% since the February Inflation Report. 17 Turning to the exchange rate, sterling’s effective exchange rate had appreciated by 2.8% since the April MPC meeting.  This reflected an appreciation of 3.1% against the euro and 2% against the US dollar.  A decomposition based on the UIP identity implied that around half of this appreciation was accounted for by ‘monetary news’. III Demand and output 18 The preliminary ONS estimate of GDP growth in 1999 Q1 had been 0.1%, the same as in 1998 Q4.  The annual rate of growth had fallen to 0.7%, the lowest rate since 1992.  Service sector output had grown by 0.4% in Q1, compared with 0.5% in 1998 Q4. Within services, distribution output growth had picked up to 0.6% in Q1 from 0.1% in Q4 and had been implicitly offset by slower growth in other services.  The ONS press release had suggested that there had been a small decline in manufacturing output in Q1 and a sharp decline in utilities output, but that construction and agricultural output had increased in Q1.  Volatile energy output was likely to have reduced GDP in Q1. 19 Manufacturing output had fallen by 0.8% in the three months to February but growth had been strong in, for example, electrical industries.  Engineering new orders had been positive in February; home new orders had risen by 9.9% in the three months to February and export orders had risen by 5.2%. 20 On the expenditure side of the National Accounts, retail sales had grown by 0.4% in March compared with a fall of 0.3% in February, and by 1.1% in Q1 following a fall of -0.2% in Q4. Annual growth had risen to 1.9% in March and had been 1.5% in Q1.  Annual growth in car registrations had been 3% in Q1 and 95% in the year to March, following the move to bi-annual registrations.  Although the new seasonal pattern had been unknown, it was possible that underlying spending on vehicles had fallen between Q4 and Q1. 21 The March CBI Distributive Trades survey had shown a pick-up in expected sales in April, and was subsequently confirmed by the April survey.  The GfK consumer confidence balance had been +1.7 in April compared to +1.6 in March, and the MORI indicator had risen sharply towards 0 in March, in line with the GfK measure of general confidence. 22 Both the Halifax and Nationwide house price indices had shown small rises in April (0.2% and 0.1% respectively).  Regional data from the Halifax Building Society showed house price inflation had continued to slow in London and the South East in 1999 Q1.  But recent survey evidence from the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) had indicated a strong turnaround in March in house price inflation in London and the South East.   23 Housing activity indicators had picked up.  In March loan approvals had risen by 13% and net lending by 36%.  The HBF site visits and net reservations had been positive for three months and particulars delivered had risen by 6% in March.  RICS sales growth had risen in Q1.  The number of properties on estate agents’ books had been at an historic low. 24 The PSNCR had been £7.4 billion in March.  The PSNB had been £4.1 billion.  For the financial year 1998/99 the PSNCR had been -£7.4 billion, the first surplus since 1990/91.  The surplus had been £2.2 billion higher than in the Budget, with £1.3 billion lower spending and £0.8 billion higher receipts.   25 Surveys had provided evidence on investment in Q1.  The BCC Survey of manufacturers had shown a slight improvement, with a balance of +4% increasing investment in plant and machinery.  But the CBI investment intentions balance had fallen slightly to -29%.  The BCC services investment intentions balance had remained above its average at +18% in Q1.  Data on imports of capital goods and the production of investment goods had suggested increases in equipment investment in Q1.  The new orders data had contrasted with the CIPS Construction survey index which had risen to 57.4 in April, the third consecutive rise in activity.  The CIPS survey had shown increases in all sectors, other than civil engineering.  Housing had been particularly strong, with 2.9% growth in private housing starts in the three months to February and 3.3% growth in completions.    26 The Bank’s regional Agents had conducted a survey of their contacts on the effect of the Millennium on investment spending and stocks.  Millennium investment spending had already been carried out by 92% of contacts and, of these, 40% intended to spend more before the Millennium.  This had mainly been related to IT systems and the Year-2000 problem and, generally, those who had not increased spending had modern systems already.  65% of investment had been additional, 38% had been brought forward (including replacing systems early rather than tampering with existing systems) and 13% had displaced other investment.  Of investment yet to be undertaken, 44% would be additional and 23% would be brought forward.  Many contacts had not yet made a decision on Millennium stocks, but 24% planned to increase stocks and 4% already had.  Retailers had expected strong demand for food and alcohol but there had been no expectation of food shortages.  Some manufacturers would be increasing stocks of finished goods to meet demand or disruption to supply. 27 The CBI Industrial Trends reported stock balance had risen to -2, compared with -14, in Q4 but stocks had still been reported to be more than adequate in Q1.  The rise in retail sales in Q1 may have further reduced retail stocks with a relatively low +15 balance of CBI retailers reporting more than adequate stocks in March. 28 The goods and services trade deficit had narrowed slightly to £2.6 billion in February because of a narrowing of the goods  Inflation Report:  August 1999 64 deficit;  the services balance had been unchanged.  Exports and imports of goods had risen in February.  The EU goods deficit had widened in February to £1 billion from £0.7 billion in January, but the non-EU goods deficit had narrowed sharply in both February and March.  Excluding oil and erratics, export volumes to the non-EU had risen by 8.7% in February and 5.4% in March, but exports to the EU had fallen by 3.3% in February.  The rise in exports to the non-EU had been fairly widespread including rises to the US, Asia and oil-exporting countries. 29 Some surveys had provided evidence for the outlook in Q2. The BCC home sales, CBI reported output, and CIPS output survey balances appeared to have bottomed out but had still been negative. CBI and BCC domestic and export orders had picked up but remained low.  The CBI April survey had shown a loss of momentum in the recovery of export orders, which may have been related to sterling’s resilience and the European slowdown.  The BCC home sales and CIPS business activity surveys had also suggested that the service sector slowdown may have been close to its trough.  CBI business optimism had risen sharply to -6 in April compared with -40 in March;  this may have suggested a trough in GDP, but the relationship between the two had not been particularly close in recent quarters. IV  The labour market 30 LFS employment had grown by 80,000 (0.3%) in the  three months to February, compared with the previous three months.  Workforce jobs data for the final quarter of 1998 had been revised downwards, further widening the gap with the LFS measure in growth rate terms.  The absolute rise in LFS employment had been evenly split between full-time and part-time:  full-time employment had increased by 44,000 (0.2%) in the three months to February and part-time employment by 38,000 (0.6%).  Total hours worked had been flat in the three months to February, and average hours worked per person had fallen by 0.2%.  The recent expansion in employment had been offset by a decline in average hours worked per full-time worker, consistent with a fall in overtime working. 31 The CIPS April surveys reported that manufacturing employment had continued to decline, albeit at a slower rate, but employment in the construction and service sectors had increased. Forward-looking surveys had been mixed.  The BCC services survey for Q1 had shown that employment intentions were close to their historic average, while the manufacturing balance had been lower than the average.  The CBI manufacturing survey balance had become less negative.  The Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services survey had suggested that the demand for employees had risen in April. 32 The number of new notifications at job centres had fallen by 500 in March, but the stock of unfilled vacancies had risen by 400. However, the vacancy figures for Northern Ireland had been affected by a discontinuity in March caused by the introduction of  a new computer system, and problems had been discovered with past West Midlands data.  Excluding these regions, the underlying trend for vacancies had been broadly flat since early 1998.  The National Press Recruitment Advertising index had fallen in March, to its lowest level since December 1996.  The BCC survey for Q1 had suggested that recruitment difficulties had persisted, but according to the CBI Industrial Trends survey for Q1 skill  shortages had shown a sharp decline, to their lowest level since 1993. 33 LFS unemployment had increased by 32,000 in the three months to February, compared with the previous three months;  the rate had edged up to 6.3%.  Claimant-count unemployment had risen by 2,000 in March, following a revised increase of 5,700 in February, although the rate had remained unchanged at 4.6%. Inflow rates to the count had risen but remained low by historic standards, while LFS data suggested that redundancies had increased.  LFS figures showed that there had been a fall of 73,000 in the number of economically inactive people in the three months to February, which had been concentrated among the long-term sick, people looking after family/home, and students. 34 Whole-economy annual average earnings growth, as measured by the AEI, had increased to 5.0% in February, reflecting faster growth in service sector earnings inflation.  Both public and private sector earnings growth had risen in February.  The headline annual rate of whole-economy earnings growth (now referred to by the final month of the three-month period under consideration, rather than the centred three-month average) had increased to 4.6% in the three months to February, from a revised 4.5% in January. The revision in January, due to late returns, had reflected a stronger contribution from bonus growth.  There had also been a change in the survey questionnaire between January and February.  Prior to February, the questionnaire had asked respondents to identify bonuses paid to employees when the bonus had changed significantly.  With effect from February 1999, information on all bonuses had been required, irrespective of the magnitude.  Because of this discontinuity, it had not been possible to assess the contribution of bonuses to the rise in average earnings growth in February.  In contrast to the AEI, the Reward Index of annual earnings growth had continued to decline into 1999, from 4.6% in January to 4.5% in February and 4.2% in March.  35 The Bank’s measure of the whole-economy employment-weighted mean wage settlement (twelve-month moving average) had fallen to 3.6% in March, having remained at 3.7% since June.  Using a matched sample (ie only including firms where data were available for both years), the twelve-month mean settlement had decreased to an annual rate of 3.2% for the three months to March 1999, from 3.9% a year earlier.  Provisional information for April had suggested that public sector settlements for 1999 had been higher than in 1998.  There had also been reports that some settlements had been delayed to April to coincide with the implementation of the National Minimum Wage. 36 Revisions to Workforce jobs data had resulted in some minor revisions to productivity and unit wage cost growth, but the picture had been broadly unchanged.  Annual productivity growth had been 0.7% in Q4 and unit wage costs had been accelerating.  V Prices 37 The Bank’s index of commodity prices excluding oil had risen by 1.9% in March.  The total index had risen 5.5%, reflecting the very sharp increase in oil prices in March.  The monthly rises had led to the annual rates of inflation in both indices to rise, though both had remained negative.  The Bank’s measure of commodity prices had increased in the first quarter, whereas both the Economist and the Economist Intelligence Unit measures had fallen.  The difference had been explained by the use of different weights and baskets of commodities. 38 The oil price had risen sharply again in April:  the one-month future price of Brent crude rose by 20.3%.  Evidence from options prices had suggested that the oil price expected in August had increased since the previous MPC meeting, and that there was slightly greater uncertainty around the estimate, but that the risks around the expectation were more balanced (though still slightly on the upside).  Producer price inflation had increased in March:  input prices largely due to oil and food prices, and output prices because of oil prices and duties. 39 Import and export price had fallen again in February, by 0.1% and 0.6% respectively.  But annual inflation had increased to -4.1% and -3.6%, the highest rates since November and December 1996 respectively.  The annual rate of retail sales deflator inflation had fallen by 0.4 percentage points to 0.8% in March.  The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) rose by 1.7% in  the year to March, 0.2 percentage points more than in February,  Monetary Policy Committee 65 owing to the effects of the measures introduced in the March Budget. 40 The annual rate of RPIX inflation had risen by 0.3 percentage points to 2.7% in March, for the same reasons as the HICP.  The rate excluding taxes and excise duties (RPIY) had fallen by 0.1 percentage point to 1.7%, and the all-items rate of inflation (RPI) had remained at 2.1%, as lower mortgage-interest payments had offset the Budget effects. VI  Reports by the Bank’s Agents 41 The Bank’s regional Agents reported on their assessment of the economy, drawn from their discussions with contacts over the past month.  There had been continued indications that the decline in manufacturing output growth had come to an end.  Expectations for output growth in the second half of 1999 had improved. Investment plans had remained focused on cost reduction and product development.  Some manufacturers had continued to invest overseas, while others had postponed investment as demand remained subdued.  Service sector growth had increased once again, especially advisory services such as accountancy and IT. But the transport industry had continued to report declining demand and increasing fuel costs.  Consumer services activity had grown only modestly.  Some leisure industry contacts had reported that expansion of capacity was no longer planned.  Import penetration had increased, especially for commodities.  And overall export growth had been reduced by sterling’s appreciation, although certain sectors such as aerospace and telecommunications had reported export growth.  German demand had declined but demand from elsewhere in Europe and from North America had remained strong, and there had been modest signs of a recovery in orders from East Asia.   42 Retail sales growth had been subdued;  exceptions had included DIY, mobile phones and personal computers.  Annual sales growth had improved in March and over Easter, but discounting to clear unwanted stocks had persisted.  Discount store sales had continued to grow while department store sales had  fallen.  Demand for new and used cars had been flat in the first quarter of 1999.  There had been a modest increase in demand for housing, part of which had been due to strong demand for properties to rent.   43 Annual pay settlements had generally remained subdued, typically ranging from 0% to 3% in manufacturing and from 2% to 5% in the service sector.  But some individual pay settlements had been higher as companies had sought to retain key staff. Manufacturers had reported ongoing job losses.  But manufacturers had been reluctant to shed staff, preferring to rely on natural wastage or to defer decisions in the hope of an upturn in orders.  In contrast, service sector recruitment had continued. VII Market intelligence 44 Expectations of UK interest rates implied by prices from financial markets had risen significantly over the past month.  The market’s view of the level of interest rates in 2000 and 2001 in particular had increased.  Three groups of views had emerged in the market on the likely direction of future interest rate decisions.  The first was that interest rates had reached a ‘trough’ at 5.25%;  this view emphasised rising prices in asset markets and growing evidence from surveys of increasing business and consumer confidence.  The second group had noted that, while rates might be near to their lows, the risks were still on the downside, and a further reduction in rates was therefore to be expected in the next month or so.  The third group believed that the prospect remained for further interest rate reductions:  the improvement in surveys had been from a low base, there was a danger of undershooting the inflation target of 21/2%, and the exchange rate had remained strong.  Despite these differing market views, the range of interest rate expectations for the next two years had narrowed since the start of January, when some in the market had not expected rates to fall as quickly as they had now done, and others had envisaged deeper cuts in interest rates than they now thought in prospect.  This suggested that the market now had a clearer view of the UK’s position in the interest rate cycle.   45 Sterling had remained strong over the month, particularly against the euro.  Expectations of the level of the exchange rate over the next twelve months, based on forward exchange rates and surveys, suggested that sterling would remain close to its current level against the US dollar.  However, market data still suggested that the pound would weaken against the euro over the same period. The appreciation of sterling since the start of the year had surprised some forecasters.  A number of possible explanations had been advanced, including changes in the expected relative cyclical positions of the United Kingdom and Continental Europe.  Market commentators had also suggested that the risk premium on the euro had risen, with the factor most recently cited being the conflict in Kosovo.  Over the past month, there had been a number of short-term influences on the exchange rate.  There had been demand for sterling related to merger and acquisition activity. Some market participants suggested that there had been portfolio shifts in favour of sterling.  And one bank with a large share of the customer market in foreign exchange had reported that its clients had bought back large amounts of sterling over a comparatively short period of time, reversing previously underweight positions.   Inflation Report:  August 1999 66 1 At the start of the meeting on 9 June, the Committee formally acknowledged the receipt of a letter from the Chancellor (attached as an annex) setting out the inflation target at which the Committee should aim in accordance with section 12 of the Bank of England Act 1998.   2 Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee reviewed developments in sterling, the world economy, monetary and financial conditions, demand and output, the labour market, prices and other considerations bearing on its decision.   Sterling’s exchange rate 3 Sterling had been volatile over the month, but had on average remained at broadly the same level as at the time of the May Committee meeting and somewhat above the level implied in the central assumption of the May Inflation Report.  Sterling had risen against the euro since the May MPC, but had fallen against the dollar.  Much of the depreciation of sterling against the dollar seemed explicable in terms of changes in market interest rate expectations—as implied by yield curves—since the previous meeting.  The publication of the much stronger than expected Japanese GDP data on 10 June was associated with a marked strengthening of the yen, and partly as a consequence an easing of sterling.   4 The depreciation of the euro against sterling and the dollar could not be accounted for purely by movements in interest rate differentials, and was more difficult to explain.  Among short run factors, developments in Kosovo might explain some of the weakness in the euro, perhaps through increasing uncertainty and via its potential effects on business and consumer confidence in continental Europe.  The markets might also be re-assessing the policy stance in the euro area in the light of the recent discussions of the Italian fiscal deficit in the context of the growth and stability pact.  A more fundamental factor was probably continued uncertainty about the prospective strength of the euro area economy when contrasted with continuing strong growth and the pick-up in consumer prices in the United States.   5 The strength in German orders data, and a stronger first quarter GDP figure than expected by the markets, had probably contributed to the slight strengthening of the euro immediately prior to the Committee’s meeting.  But if it simply reflected an expectation of stronger German demand, this was not apparently embodied in interest rate expectations. 6 Summing up, the Committee noted that the depreciation in the euro since the turn of the year was not especially large in an historical context.  Nevertheless, looking at a rate for the synthetic euro against the dollar over a longer period, the euro was stronger than in the early and mid-eighties, but as low as at any time over the past ten years. 7 Turning to sterling, it was difficult to link recent changes in its rate against the euro to past and prospective movements in interest rate differentials.  Whether or not the Committee cut at this meeting, the market might take the view that a trough in interest rates had been reached for this cycle.  If that caused expectations of the future path of interest rates to be revised up then sterling might strengthen.  However, it was possible that a reduction in rates at the current meeting might be accompanied by a fall in sterling.  So, as always, the effect on the exchange rate of a possible reduction in interest rates was uncertain.  And, in any case, the Committee agreed that whatever the expectation in the market, the future path of interest rates would depend on what developments in the economy as a whole implied for the prospects for inflation.  8 It was also noted that an increase in US rates and further reduction in UK interest rates could eliminate the present  short-term interest rate differential.  This could be important to those with ‘carry trades’—a strategy of borrowing in low yielding currencies to buy higher yielding currencies.  There was evidence that some market participants used this strategy.  Views differed on how much weight to put on this explanation of sterling strength. 9 Overall, the Committee thought that the situation had not changed much since the previous month’s meeting.  Sterling had remained, on average, somewhat above the central assumption in the May Inflation Report over the past month, and if it were not to weaken as assumed, it raised the likelihood that inflation would undershoot the target. The world economy 10 There was not much sign of a slowdown in the US economy over the month.  The Federal Open Market Committee had recently moved to a bias to tighten.  Equity markets had been relatively stable over the month.  Taken together the news suggested that the probability of a soft landing for the US economy had improved.   11 Some of the backward looking data in the euro area continued to look quite weak.  But the recent orders and unemployment data had been better than expected.  German GDP had increased by 0.4% in the first quarter, and was slightly stronger than expected by the markets, but it contained little news relative to the Committee’s central assumption in its May projections.  The more forward-looking indicators—such as consumer and business confidence—had perhaps shown signs of stabilising. 12 Many of the recent Japanese monthly indicators had been distorted by the Golden Week holidays, which made seasonal adjustment more difficult.  But, on balance, they probably suggested that activity was broadly flat.  Growth in the monetary base had, however, increased.  The GDP figure for the first quarter—released on 10 June—had been surprisingly strong and the stock market had initially rallied.  But no analysis of the GDP data was yet available.  The Committee noted that there had been quite large quarterly volatility in Japanese GDP over recent years, so were cautious in reading much into one strong quarterly number. 13 The yields on dollar-denominated bonds issued by emerging market economy governments had risen relative to US Treasury bond yields as expectations of a tightening of US monetary policy had increased, though they had shown signs of easing back down more recently.  But prospects in Asia seemed a little brighter than a month ago, as did the situation in Brazil and Latin America more generally.  Some official Chinese interest rates had recently been reduced by 1%. 14 Overall, the news on prospects for the world economy had been mildly positive over the month, with the euro area and Japan looking a little stronger.  The prospects of a soft landing in the United States seemed to have improved, and the downside risks to emerging markets might have eased. Monetary and financial conditions 15 The strength of the housing market was evident in both price and activity data.  The Halifax and Nationwide house price indexes had both risen strongly in May, and the annual rates of increase were now rising.  The aggregate rise in house prices over recent months was probably within the bounds of what might be expected given changes in interest rates since last autumn.  There were signs of the strengthening housing market in the household sector lending Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 9–10 June 1999  Monetary Policy Committee 67 figures, which had continued to rise over recent months.  The Committee recalled that looking forward, its assumption in the central projection of the May forecast was that house prices would rise in line with nominal earnings, which would need to be reviewed in the context of the next forecasting round. 16 Forward short maturity interest rates had risen substantially over the past month, in part reflecting changing expectations about the timing of possible UK entry into EMU and in part accompanying the rise in short maturity rates in the US.  Longer maturity nominal bond yields had risen—reflecting those factors and continued fading of the after-effects of the LTCM crisis, which had depressed yields—whereas there had been little change in the yields on UK index-linked government bonds.  The Committee discussed the implications of these developments for real rates and inflation expectations.   17 As discussed by the Committee at its January meeting, there was some uncertainty about the level of real yields signalled by index-linked bonds.  In particular, past changes to rules relating to pension fund holdings of bonds had led to an increased holding of index-linked bonds by that sector.  It seemed that the changes had prolonged effects on yields, as stock holdings were adjusted following actuarial guidance.  But it was not clear that this would have significantly distorted the change in implied UK inflation expectations over the past month.  However, there had only been a slight rise in inflation expectations in the surveys of other forecasters’ projections, which on average had now risen back towards the inflation target of 2.5%.  Therefore, since it was not plausible that inflation expectations had risen by as much as short maturity forward rates, it was likely that short-term real yields had risen. 18 At the short end of the curve, there were signs that building society and other lenders had raised interest rates on fixed rate mortgages, so some tightening had occurred.  For loans advanced on variable, rather than fixed, interest rates, there had been only a small pass-through of the reduction of official rates in April.    Demand and output 19 The latest data provided no firm reasons to move away from the central projections for demand and output made at the time of the May Inflation Report.  GDP growth had been revised down 0.1% in the first quarter, and was now flat on the headline market price measure and had fallen slightly measured at basic prices. After adjusting for volatile components such as energy—which had been weak in the first quarter—growth of GDP at basic prices was still in line with the May central projection, at 0.1%.  The staff’s latest estimates, based on survey evidence on new orders, suggested a pick-up in GDP growth in Q2.  This pick-up was still broadly consistent with the May central projection.  The National Institute of Economic and Social Research had released its monthly GDP estimate following publication of the industrial production figures. It showed growth of 0.2% in the three months to May, which also suggested an increase in growth from the trough at the turn of the year. 20 Within the expenditure breakdown of GDP, there were some signs that the usually less-volatile components—such as consumption—were stronger on the quarter, while those that were typically more volatile—such as investment—were weaker. However, even in the case of consumption there were special factors.  In particular, the change in the registration date for new car sales meant that seasonal adjustment of the Q1 data was difficult and that underlying consumption was probably a little weaker than the headline numbers suggested.  That said, the figure was still likely to have been stronger than the Committee had assumed in its May projections.  There had been a continuing rise in consumer confidence over recent months.  One puzzle was the recent weakness of retail sales in both the official data and in surveys, given the strength of Q1 consumption and consumer confidence.   21 Business surveys had also shown signs of further improvement over the past month, although the tone being reported to the Bank’s regional Agents was, on balance, a little softer than this.  The latest monthly trade data had pointed to a greater weakening of exports—particularly to the EU—compared to the assumption in the May Inflation Report.  The CBI survey, while showing an improvement in domestic orders, still recorded considerable pessimism about export orders.  The corresponding question in the CIPS survey had, however, shown a recovery in export orders.  Although the latest batch of surveys had been conducted after the recent appreciation in sterling, there was some concern about the fragility of the overall rise in survey balances, especially if sterling were to remain strong.  The Bank’s regional Agents’ survey suggested that many companies were expecting sterling to depreciate. 22 The income and expenditure release of the National Accounts also included a sharp fall in the figure for companies’ operating profits in the first quarter, which followed a fall in the fourth quarter.  The latest evidence on the number of profit warnings, and analysts’ profit expectations for 1999, did not yet provide any corroborative evidence of such a sharp fall in the first quarter.  It was difficult to know how much weight to place on the fall, until firmer data on profits had been fed into the accounts by the ONS.  The operating profit figure included an adjustment, to ensure that the income, expenditure and output measures were aligned from quarter to quarter, but the details of any adjustment in Q1 would not be published by the ONS until the full National Accounts release.  The ONS had suggested that the construction output figures were less firmly grounded than usual.  As usual, in the run up to the annual re-balancing of the National Accounts there were a number of puzzles in the data, and there were likely to be revisions in due course.  It was not possible at this stage to draw any firm conclusions about the likely direction and scale of any revisions. Labour market 23 There had not been much news on labour market quantities over the past month, relative to what had been expected in the May projections.  But looking back over the past three or four months it was, perhaps, still surprising that the labour market had not weakened by as much as expected at the start of the year.   24 On the prices side, earnings growth in the year to March, as measured by the Average Earnings Index, had been in line with the assumption in the May Inflation Report.  The Reward index had continued to fall.  The disparate movements in the public and private sectors complicated the picture for settlements.  Recent public sector awards had pushed up the aggregate whole economy twelve-month employment-weighted mean to 3.9%, despite a continuing fall in private sector settlements.  A matched sample of private sector settlements also showed that they were lower in April than in the corresponding period last year.  More work would be needed on the impact on RPIX inflation of the public sector settlements, both directly and indirectly via their effects on private sector behaviour.  As the April figures were not yet available, it was still too early to judge whether the effect of the National Minimum Wage on earnings was in line with the assumption made in the Committee’s projections. 25 The continued strength in the latest employment data implied another weak productivity growth figure in the first quarter, and a corresponding rise in unit labour costs.  This would continue the pattern of weak productivity growth figures seen over the past four years.  The fact that employment continued to grow, and that there had been no significant rise in unemployment, might be consistent with the finding of the Agents’ survey.  The survey results suggested that, while many companies assumed no change in sterling, more companies were expecting sterling’s exchange rate to fall than to rise, and companies might consequently be delaying adjustments to their workforce for as long as possible.  However,  Inflation Report:  August 1999 68 this could not explain much of the apparent weakness of productivity growth in recent years.  Another possible explanation, among several discussed in recent Inflation Reports, continued to be that output was underrecorded, and that the true rate of productivity growth was stronger than recorded, although there was no firm evidence for this.  The limited data available for the service sector, relative to manufacturing, made it difficult to reach conclusions in this area. 26 Looking at productivity growth over a longer period, it was probably best to assume that the trend rate of productivity growth— which was what was important for assessing inflationary pressure—had not changed significantly over recent years.  Indeed, average productivity growth since 1990 was not out of line with its long-run historical trend. Prices 27 The Committee noted that both including and excluding oil, sterling commodity prices on the Bank’s UK demand-weighted index were now rising in annual terms.  The oil price had stabilised in recent weeks.  Brent was currently trading at around $15–$16 per barrel, and was a little below the peak reached in early May.  The oil price was now broadly in line with the assumption made in the May Inflation Report for the middle of this year.  28 RPIX inflation had fallen by slightly more than expected in April, largely on account of seasonal foods, which were usually quite volatile.  The latest ONS advance estimate of RPIX, which was not usually available at the time of the Committee meeting, suggested that the May figure would also turn out weaker than had previously been expected.  Although this seemed likely to have implications for the short-term inflation projection, it was not clear to what extent there was any news for the inflation projections looking two years or so ahead.  The recent and prospective fall in RPI inflation to levels well below RPIX, on account of previous reductions in mortgage interest rates, might further reduce pay settlements. Other considerations bearing on the policy decision this month 29 The Committee’s statement the previous month explaining its decision had said that if sterling were not to decline as assumed in the central projection of the May Inflation Report, it was likely that inflation would undershoot the inflation target over the coming two years.  And, in those circumstances, depending on other developments in the economy, there might, therefore, need to be further easing of interest rates in order to keep inflation on track to meet the 21/2% target.  At this meeting the Committee reviewed the time frame over which it might need to take action if sterling remained strong and there were no other offsetting developments affecting the inflation outlook.  One issue was how big the deviation in exchange rates from the May assumption needed to be in order to be quantitatively significant in terms of the forecast of inflation.  Another issue was the appropriate filter to use to smooth high frequency movements in the exchange rate.   The immediate policy decision 30 On one view a further reduction in the official interest rate of 25 basis points was needed to meet the inflation target.  There were various strands to this argument, to which members attached different weights. 31 The exchange rate had on average been stronger over the past month than incorporated in the May Report.  If that strength were to persist, then the likelihood of inflation falling below target would have increased.  Although the statement issued last month did not mean that action had to be taken immediately if sterling did not weaken as assumed in the central projection, there seemed to be no advantage in waiting. 32 Some members of the Committee were uneasy, on empirical grounds, about the use of the Uncovered Interest Parity assumption in the central projection, and for them sterling’s persistent strength was not a surprise.  They placed weight on the observation that a further reduction in UK rates, and the future increase in US  rates expected by the market, might mean that the UK would  no longer have the highest short-term interest rates of the G7 countries. 33 Some members were also impressed by the fact that since the turn of the year, sterling had consistently turned out stronger than assumed each month.  And although the May Inflation Report fully reflected the appreciation of the exchange rate in the first  part of the year, its persistent rise created a greater sense of underlying strength and weakened perceptions of the likelihood of the sustained fall in sterling that was assumed in the central projection.   34 Private sector wage settlements had continued to fall, although there had been a rise in public sector settlements.  The fall in RPI inflation relative to RPIX might further depress settlements. In addition to the news on the exchange rate, the recent outturns and short-term outlook for RPIX suggested that the saucer shape evident in the May central projection for inflation would, if anything, be a little deeper and more protracted than thought then. It might be possible to mitigate this slightly by prompt action, without risking too sharp an upturn in prospective inflation further ahead.   35 Although house prices were rising, so far this seemed consistent with the reduction in interest rates since October.  The yield curve had steepened over the past month, and interest rates at maturities of 1–4 years had risen substantially so that, to the extent that this represented a rise in real rates, some tightening had effectively taken place.   36 Some members thought that, although the forward-looking survey indicators were stronger over the past month, consumer and business confidence indicators were still fragile.  There was still relatively little firm evidence from official data that activity had picked up in the second quarter.  The latest trade data had suggested that the immediate outlook for exports was still deteriorating.  The recent weakness of retail sales in both the official data and in surveys, while supported by the Agents’ reports, was puzzling.  It suggested that expenditure was not yet accelerating.  A further reduction in interest rates might help to support business and consumer confidence, which would make the projected upturn in activity more likely, especially in the light of the Agents’ survey of companies’ exchange rate expectations. 37 Overall, as sterling had not fallen back and given developments in private sector wage settlements and the short-term outlook for retail prices, as well as the tightening of monetary conditions during the month through the rise in short-term market interest rates, those members who had voted for a reduction in the official interest rate the previous month remained of that view;   and some others agreed that the balance of risks to inflation  now warranted a modest reduction in the official interest rate this month. 38 On another view, there was not a convincing case for a further reduction in the official interest rate.  There were three main considerations.  First, sterling had been volatile over the month, and the level of the exchange rate index on the morning of the Committee meeting was not significantly different from that assumed in the central projection of the May Inflation Report.  It was better not to place too much weight on high frequency movements in sterling between quarterly Inflation Report projection rounds.  Second, there had not been much news to change the picture for activity over the past month.  The world economy looked a little brighter.  On the domestic economy,  Monetary Policy Committee 69 backward-looking indicators were mixed.  Output growth had been revised down a little but non-oil output was still rising.  Most forward-looking indicators—such as household and business surveys—continued to improve.  Consumption growth was strong and house prices had risen sharply over the past month.  The full effects of the earlier reduction in interest rates from 7.5% to 5.25% had yet to be seen.  There were no strong grounds for diverging from the central projection in the May Report.  Third, even though there had been little news on activity, RPIX inflation had turned out a little weaker than expected.  In consequence, the short-term outlook for inflation was if anything a little lower than a month ago, but there was only a limited amount that the Committee could do at this very short horizon.  The implications of the latest ONS advance estimate of RPIX were not clear.  In setting monetary policy it was necessary to look further ahead.  Looking further out, there was little to change the view, embodied in the May projection, that the benign effects on inflation of the rise in sterling and falls in import prices would be wearing off as domestic activity recovered.  There had also been a slight rise in inflation expectations as measured by surveys, which was an indicator that the Committee had placed weight on in the past. 39 The Governor invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate be reduced by 25 basis points to 5.0%.  Eight members of the Committee (the Governor, David Clementi, Willem Buiter, Charles Goodhart, DeAnne Julius, Ian Plenderleith, John Vickers and Sushil Wadhwani) voted for the proposition.  Mervyn King voted against, preferring to maintain the Bank’s repo rate at 5.25%. 40 The following members were present: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers Sushil Wadhwani 41 Gus O’Donnell was present as the Treasury representative.  Inflation Report:  August 1999 70 1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by the Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee on 3 June, in advance of its meeting on 9–10 June 1999.  At the start of the Committee meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and that information is included in the Annex. I The international economy 2 Strong economic growth had continued in the United States. After a downward revision of 0.1 percentage point, owing to weaker net trade, GDP was estimated to have increased by 1.0% in 1999 Q1.  The annual growth rate of industrial production had increased to 2.0% in April and the level of output in March had been revised up, bringing the official data more into line with the National Association of Purchasing Managers’ (NAPM) index.  The growth rate of export volumes had also picked up, with a noticeable rise in sales to Asian countries.  But, despite this improvement in exports, the March trade deficit had reached a record level  ($19.7 billion) owing to continued strong import growth.  More recently, however, retail sales and employment growth had slowed. The slowdown in the rate of job creation in May was sharper than most commentators had expected, but revisions to March and April data raised the level of non-farm payrolls by 185,000. 3 A few signs of price pressures had begun to emerge.  The NAPM prices-paid index rose above 50 in May, the first time it had exceeded the neutral level since December 1997.  And consumer price inflation had increased by 0.5 percentage points in April, to 2.3%.  Both of these developments were heavily influenced by higher oil prices.  More surprisingly, ‘core’ inflation had also risen and the annual growth rate of average earnings had increased to 3.6% in May.  Reflecting these developments, the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) had adopted a bias towards tightening monetary policy.  In response, financial market expectations for an increase in official interest rates had been brought forward.  On  9 June, the markets were expecting the FOMC to raise interest rates by at least 25 basis points by September and to implement a further tightening over the next two years.  The rise in interest rate expectations had led to a slight flattening in the nominal US Treasury yield curve. 4 Within the euro area, the gap between business and consumer confidence had continued to narrow in May, reflecting weaker consumer confidence and an improvement in business confidence.  Consumer confidence had been particularly weak in Italy.  Euro-area industrial production had been flat in March, though stronger in France and Spain than in Germany and Italy. Broad money growth had remained moderate but narrow money was growing rapidly.  In Q1, German GDP had increased by 0.4% and French GDP had grown by 0.3%. 5 Japanese data had been distorted by the Golden Week holiday in April, but the underlying trend appeared to be flat.  The Bank of Japan had kept overnight interest rates at 0.03%, and term rates were beginning to decline suggesting that the monetary easing was being passed through.  However, total bank lending had continued to fall, as banks had continued to write-off non-performing loans.  Industrial production had fallen by 2.7% in April, reversing the rise in March.  Housing starts had increased by 1.1% in the year to April, the first rise since December 1996. However, private construction orders had fallen sharply in April, more than offsetting the rise in public construction orders related to the November fiscal package.  The unemployment rate had remained at a record 4.8%;  employment had decreased and inactivity had increased.  The trade surplus had narrowed in April as import growth had exceeded export growth.  The deflationary trend had persisted;  in April, ‘core’ consumer price inflation was  -0.1% and domestic wholesale price inflation was -1.9%. 6 In the financial markets, the euro had continued to depreciate, while the yen and dollar effective exchange rates had appreciated over the month.  The Nikkei-225 index had fallen by 4% since the May MPC meeting while the S&P 500 had fallen  by 2%.  Spreads on emerging market bonds had widened slightly, but the nominal exchange rates of these countries were little changed. II Monetary and financial conditions 7 The growth rate of narrow money had been rising.  In May, the three and six-month annualised growth rates for notes and coin, after adjusting for the introduction of the new 50 pence and £2 coins, had increased to 7.7% and 7.4% respectively, up from around 5.0% last autumn.  Econometric work by Bank staff suggested that recent interest rate cuts were likely to have started to boost narrow money growth from around the end of last year. 8 M4 had risen by 1.1% (or £8.8 billion) in April, compared with an average monthly flow of just £2.7 billion in the first quarter of this year.  M4 lending had also been strong, rising by 0.9% (or £7.8 billion) on the month. 9 The M4 deposits of the household sector had increased by 1.1% (or £5.1 billion) in April.  This figure would have been influenced by:  the introduction of cash ISAs (which attracted deposits of £1.8 billion over the month);  windfall payments of  £0.6 billion to account-holders at Birmingham Midshires following the Halifax takeover;  and the purchase by the Prudential Corporation from a charitable trust (which is included as part of the household sector) of £0.6 billion of M&G shares.  Together these special factors had probably accounted for only around £1.5 billion of the monthly flow (some of the money going into ISAs probably came from the windfall, and some would have reflected a portfolio reallocation away from taxable savings instruments within M4). Adjusting for these considerations, the flow had been around £3.6 billion, significantly stronger than the average monthly increase over the past year (£2.4 billion). 10 M4 lending to the household sector had increased by 0.8% (or £4.0 billion) in April.  Total lending to individuals, by both M4 and non-M4 financial institutions, had also been strong, rising by £4.4 billion on the month.  Within the total, lending secured on dwellings had been a little weaker than in March, though the monthly flow (£3.0 billion) had remained well above the average for the past year.  Consumer credit growth had increased slightly to 1.4% in April. 11 Private non-financial corporations’ (PNFCs) M4 deposits had been weak in April, falling by 0.1%.  At the same time these companies had borrowed heavily:  strong sterling borrowing from UK banks and building societies was matched by strong capital issues.  Total borrowing by PNFCs had been £6.5 billion in April. The available evidence suggested that these funds were largely being used for investment, and were not an indication of distress borrowing.  Over the year to 1999 Q1, net recourse to banks (net new borrowing minus net new deposits) was much stronger in the service sector, where investment had been strong, than in the manufacturing sector, where any borrowing to cover unexpected shortfalls in cashflow might have been expected to have been concentrated. 12 OFCs’ M4 deposits had increased by 2.1% (or £3.8 billion) in April.  This strong flow followed three consecutive months in Annex:  Summary of data presented by Bank staff  Monetary Policy Committee 71 which OFCs’ M4 deposits had fallen.  OFCs’ M4 borrowing had risen by 0.6% in April. 13 Turning to price indicators of monetary conditions, there had been a marked rise in interest rate expectations implied by  longer-dated short-sterling futures contracts:  the rate implied by the September 2001 contract had increased by almost 60 basis points since the previous meeting, to 6.4%.  A variety of explanations were considered.  First, stronger-than-expected US CPI data, coupled with the FOMC’s adoption of a bias to tighten monetary policy, had increased expectations that US interest rates might soon be raised.  This could have had implications for UK interest rate expectations if, for example, market participants believed that US inflation data were a leading indicator of  world-wide inflationary pressure.  Second, some domestic data releases over the month suggested a more buoyant outlook for the UK economy. 14 It appeared that mortgage lenders had still not fully passed on the 8 April reduction in the official repo rate.  Conversely, there had been large falls in credit card rates reflecting increased competition in that sector. 15 Nominal forward interest rates had increased by some 40 to 45 basis points at the three to five year horizon since the previous meeting.  Over the same period, real forward rates had increased by around 5 basis points, so it appeared that medium-term inflation expectations (ie three to five years ahead) had also increased by 35 to 40 basis points.  It was possible that the ‘true’ rise exceeded this: demand for certain gilts to repo for cash over the Millennium period was thought to have increased and this had led to artificially low nominal gilt yields.  A measure of inflation expectations three years ahead derived from the swap curve had risen by around 65 basis points.  Conversely, survey measures of inflation expectations for the years 1999 and 2000 had either not increased or risen only moderately (by 10 or 20 basis points) and had remained below the 21/2% target. 16 The sterling effective exchange rate index had fallen by 0.1% since the May meeting, to 104.6.  This was somewhat higher than the level embodied in the central projection of the May Inflation Report.  Sterling had appreciated by 0.7% against the euro, and fallen by 1.6% against the US dollar.  Most of the fall against the dollar was probably related to monetary policy news, in particular a growing expectation that US interest rates would soon be raised.  Sterling’s rise against the euro was harder to explain in terms of monetary policy news.  Compared with the previous meeting, UK equity prices were broadly unchanged. III Demand and output 17 Quarterly GDP growth in 1999 Q1, at constant market prices, had been revised down from 0.1% to 0%, reducing the annual growth rate to 0.6%.  The weakness of GDP in Q1 had been influenced by a sharp decline in energy related output due to the mild winter—excluding the energy, utility, and agriculture sectors, GDP had grown by 0.1%.  However, measured at basic prices, output had fallen by 0.1% in Q1, the first decline in seven years.  In the first quarter, the level of the expenditure measure of GDP had been 0.7% below the average measure. 18 The downward revision to GDP growth in Q1 had reflected a lower service sector growth estimate of 0.2% (down from 0.4%). Within the service sector, distribution output had increased by 0.6%, transport and communications had grown by 0.2% and business and financial services had fallen by 0.3%. 19 Largely reflecting the weakness of energy output, total industrial production had fallen by 0.9% in Q1.  Although manufacturing output had continued to decline, the pace of contraction had slowed to 0.3% in Q1, from 1.3% in 1998 Q4. Construction output had increased by 0.2% in the first quarter but had been 3% lower than a year ago.  The ONS had noted that these figures were less firmly based than normal.  Agriculture and fisheries output had fallen by 0.5% on the previous quarter and by 0.6% on a year ago. 20 The expenditure breakdown of GDP had shown domestic demand growing by 0.4% in Q1, with inventories making a contribution of -0.2 percentage points.  However, this growth in domestic demand had been offset by a -0.5 percentage point contribution to growth from net trade.  The main differences between the expenditure outturns and the projections embodied in the May Inflation Report had been stronger consumer spending and weaker investment. 21 Consumer expenditure had grown by 1.1% in 1999 Q1, the highest quarterly growth rate for over a year.  Spending on vehicles, durable goods, clothing, communications, and financial services had all been strong.  However, it was likely that the vehicle expenditure figures had been influenced by the introduction of the changes to the vehicle registration scheme in March.  Pre-tax compensation of employees had grown by 1.9% in the same period. Government expenditure had risen by 1.4%. 22 Total investment had declined by 1.7% in Q1, but had grown by 3.1% on a year ago.  Business investment had fallen by 2%, largely owing to steep declines in construction and ‘other production’ investment.  In Q1, manufacturing investment had fallen by 2.5% while service sector investment had increased by 1.1%.  Corporate profits had deteriorated further—the gross operating surplus of corporations had fallen by 3.2% in Q1 and  by 9.4% in the year to Q1.  However, the actual size of the decline in corporate profitability in the first quarter was uncertain, since these data incorporated the quarterly statistical alignment adjustment.  23 In the first quarter, the trade deficit at constant market prices had increased to 4.3% of GDP.  Export volumes of goods and services had fallen by 1.4% while import volumes had risen by 0.3%.  The goods and services deficit at current prices had widened to £4.6 billion in Q1—the highest figure since 1990. Geographically, demand from EU countries had been particularly weak in Q1—goods exports to the EU had fallen by 4.1%, while sales to non-EU countries had been little changed.  Imports of goods had increased by 1.7% in Q1 and by 2.4% in March.  The latest monthly trade data pointed to a larger negative contribution to GDP growth in Q1 than had been assumed in the May Inflation Report. 24 Turning to developments in Q2, retail sales volumes had fallen by 0.5% in April.  However, in the three months to April, sales volumes had increased by 1.8% on a year earlier and by 0.6% on the previous three months.  Total car registrations had fallen by 3.9% in May, lowering the annual growth rate to 1.8%, from 6.6%. The CBI Distributive Trades survey had reported lower annual sales growth in May, although orders placed with suppliers had increased sharply.  According to the CBI, expected sales growth for June had been the strongest since July 1998.  The GfK consumer confidence index had also increased in May, leaving it at its highest level in twelve months. 25 The rise in consumer confidence had been accompanied by a pick-up in housing activity.  The number of particulars delivered had increased by 5% in April, and by 9% on a year earlier. Similarly, the number of loan approvals had gone up by 15% in the three months to April.  Reflecting these developments, the Halifax and Nationwide house price indices recorded monthly rises of 2.1% and 1.2% in May, with annual inflation at 5.7% and 7.4% respectively.  House price inflation in London and south-east England had exceeded the national average since the mid 1990s, and survey evidence from the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors had suggested a continuation of this trend.  Inflation Report:  August 1999 72 26 The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) manufacturing output index had been 53.1 in May, the second month in a row in which it had been above the neutral level of 50. The recovery had been led by consumer goods producers;  the index for investment goods had remained negative.  New orders, both domestic and export, had improved significantly since October 1998.  Similarly, the CBI’s survey measures of total orders and output expectations had also increased in recent months.  However, according to the CBI, export order books had shown no improvement in May. 27 The CIPS services output index had been 56.4 in May, well above the neutral level for the third month running.  The CIPS construction survey had reported a rise in construction activity for the fourth consecutive month in May, with the total activity index at its highest level for 14 months, and housing activity had grown at its fastest rate in the last two years.  28 A survey by the Bank’s regional Agents covering 140 firms had revealed that the strength of the exchange rate had affected manufacturing firms more adversely than service sector companies. The majority of firms surveyed expected that the pound would remain broadly unchanged or depreciate against the euro over the next twelve months.  But, there was little expectation that the sterling-dollar exchange rate would move much in the next year. Most of the manufacturing firms surveyed had indicated that sterling’s strength was impacting negatively on both their domestic and external market share.  In contrast, the majority of service sector firms surveyed had indicated little impact of the level of sterling on their domestic or export market performance. IV The labour market 29 Employment had continued to grow, but at a slower pace than in the second half of 1998.  According to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), employment had risen by 63,000 (0.2%) in Q1, down from 0.4% in 1998 Q4.  Most of the slow-down had reflected slower growth in part-time employment.  Provisional data had suggested that manufacturing employment had continued to fall in Q1.  The CIPS surveys for May had also pointed to a further fall in manufacturing employment and a slowdown in the pace of service sector job creation.  By contrast, the surveys suggested that construction sector employment growth had increased.  The May Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services (FRES) survey had pointed to rising demand for permanent placements and temporary staff for the third month running. 30 Total hours worked had risen by 0.3% in the three months to March, but had been only 0.1% higher than a year earlier.  The rise in Q1 had reflected the fact that average hours worked by full-time employees had been flat, having previously been falling.  The proportion of employees who usually worked more than 45 hours per week had continued to fall in Q1, perhaps reflecting the impact of the Working Time Directive. 31 Discrepancies identified by the ONS in the official series for the number of outstanding Job Centre vacancies meant that the data had become an unreliable indicator of recent trends in vacancies. Notifications of new Job Centre vacancies—which the ONS considered a more reliable measure—had been broadly flat since late 1994.  However, the national Press Recruitment Advertising Index (which has a high proportion of professional jobs) had continued to fall quite sharply. 32 The claimant count had declined by 17,400 in April, but had been distorted by difficulties with seasonal adjustment around the Easter period related to changes in the entitlement of students to unemployment benefit.  LFS unemployment had risen by 24,000 in Q1.  Aggregate unemployment rates on both measures had remained broadly stable in recent months.  Short-term LFS unemployment (duration less than a year) had risen, as it had for the previous six months, and long-term unemployment had fallen less rapidly than in previous quarters.  The relative dispersion of regional unemployment rates had increased further, and had now returned to typical levels seen over the past 25 years, having been extremely low for much of the early 1990s. 33 The combination of higher employment and higher unemployment had been associated with a further fall in inactivity of 47,000 in Q1, according to the LFS;  rather less than in the previous quarter. 34 The official headline measure of annual earnings growth had increased to 4.8% in March.  Both public and private sector earnings had risen;  on a sectoral basis, the main contribution had come from the service sector.  By contrast, the Reward Index had suggested that earnings growth had fallen, to 4.2% in March and 3.9% in April.  But temporary divergences of this size between the Average Earnings Index (AEI) and the Reward Index have not been unusual.  According to the FRES survey, the balance of those reporting a monthly rise in pay rates for agency placements had risen slightly in both April and May.  And rough calculations suggested that growth in earnings per hour had remained stronger than that in earnings per head. 35 It was not possible to say how much of the rise in the AEI headline rate in March had reflected higher growth in bonuses. Although the official data had appeared to show a sharp rise in the contribution of bonuses to annual earnings growth and a fall in the annual growth of regular pay, both series had been distorted by a change in the method used to collect bonus data.  Investigations by the ONS had shown no evidence that the change in bonus reporting had had any distorting effect on the reporting of total gross pay, so the headline AEI rate should have been unaffected.  The decline in profits growth in recent quarters suggested that profit-related bonuses could be growing more slowly than previously.  But bonuses were also influenced by other factors, including labour market tightness and structural changes in the use of bonus and performance-related pay. 36 The Bank’s average twelve-month whole-economy wage settlement measure had increased from 3.6% in March to 3.9% in April.  But no settlement information had yet been received from about a quarter of the firms usually in the sample, and the Bank’s database over-represented the public sector.  Applying the AEI weights to the sectoral indices suggested that weighted settlements had risen only 0.1 percentage point, to 3.7%, in the twelve months to April.  A matched sample had suggested that private sector settlements had continued to fall in April, compared with a year earlier.  Other reports had also suggested a further slight easing in wage settlements.  The Bank’s Agents had reported that upward pressures on wages were limited, although some employees were being awarded above-inflation increases because of skills shortages. V Prices 37 Oil prices had stabilised in May, averaging $15.83 per barrel. The Bank’s non-oil commodity index had increased by 1.7% in the year to April, the first positive annual inflation rate since 1996. This had been mainly the result of higher domestic food and fuel prices (83% of the non-oil index). 38 Largely reflecting the effects of higher oil prices, input price deflation had moderated;  in the year to April the index had fallen by 1.3%, following an annual decline of 3.8% in March.  Similarly, output prices had increased because of higher petroleum prices and duties, but annual producer price inflation excluding duties (PPIY) had stayed subdued, at -0.3%.  Both the CIPS and the CBI surveys had suggested continued producer price deflation.  Import and export prices had risen slightly in March, mainly because of higher oil prices. 39 Annual retail sales deflator inflation had remained at 0.7% in April while annual GDP deflator inflation had fallen to 2.0% in 1999 Q1, from 2.6% in 1998 Q4.  The fall had been largely  Monetary Policy Committee 73 accounted for by lower contributions from the household expenditure and net export categories.  Indicators of domestically generated inflation had also fallen in Q1—the GDP-based measure declined to 2.5% and the RPIX-based measure to 4.2%. 40 RPI and RPIX inflation had declined to 1.6% and 2.4% respectively, reflecting the dropping out from the twelve-month comparison of the 1998 Budget road-fuel price effects and weaker food price inflation.  In April, annual HICP inflation had fallen by 0.2 percentage points to 1.5%. VI Reports by the Bank’s Agents 41 The Bank’s regional Agents reported on their discussions with contacts over the past month.  Confidence levels in the manufacturing sector had risen, following subdued activity in Q1, but there had been little evidence of increasing orders. Manufacturers had expected limited growth in the second quarter. Demand from export markets had improved;  US demand had remained strong and demand from East Asian and Middle East countries had increased.  But sterling’s appreciation had forced exporters to cut prices to retain market share and had caused greater import penetration.  Manufacturing investment intentions had remained concentrated on productivity gains rather than capacity increases.  An increasing number of manufacturers had begun to consider investing abroad. 42 Annual retail sales growth had been sluggish.  Retail contacts had expectations of limited sales growth in the second quarter and retail property investment intentions had declined. Sales volumes growth had been largely dependent on price discounting.  Sales of fashion and homeware goods had been  below normal for the time of year, but strong mobile phone and personal computer sales growth had persisted.  Car dealers had reported weak annual sales growth, heavy discounting and a reluctance to build stocks for the new registration in September.  In contrast, annual leisure sector growth had continued;  restaurants, entertainment venues and tour operators had all reported increased consumer spending.  Investment intentions had remained strong. Housing market activity had risen overall;  new building had increased, with many first-time buyers evident.  That said, growth had been strongest in London and south-east England;  elsewhere, significant pockets of negative mortgage equity had persisted. 43 Manufacturing employment had continued to fall and skill shortages to ease.  Any labour hoarding had tended to reflect  short-term factors, such as waiting for enquiries to become orders, rather than longer-term concerns about replacement of skills. Manufacturing wage growth had fallen, despite the continued need, in many cases, to buy out profit-related pay schemes.  Service sector wage growth had remained stronger, though with wide variations depending on individual performance and sector.  Skill shortages had continued to ease, even in competitive sectors such as IT, suggesting less upward pressure on future service sector wage settlements.   VII Market intelligence 44 The expected UK interest rate curve implied by prices from financial markets had steepened significantly.  In particular, the market’s view of the level of interest rates in 2000 and 2001 had increased.  This reflected three main factors.  First, market expectations of an increase in US interest rates had increased during the course of the month, with US markets pricing in a rise of at least a 1/4 percentage point in the Federal Funds target rate by September 1999.  Second, the market had interpreted recent  UK data, such as the CIPS survey and Halifax price index, as  strong.  Third, some market players’ perceptions of the likelihood and timing of UK entry into EMU had changed.  This had  changed their expected path of UK interest rates over the next five years. 45 The increase in market expectations of UK interest rates had been one factor behind sterling’s continued strength in effective terms over the month.  Several other factors had influenced market sentiment, including market concern over fiscal discipline in the euro area.  Developments in Kosovo had had an impact at particular moments, but were probably less influential than in the previous month.  Information from the foreign exchange options market suggested that the downside risk to sterling had increased slightly following the statement accompanying the May MPC meeting, although the effect had not been great and had subsequently been offset by other factors.  Some market participants reported that portfolio shifts into sterling and out of the euro had continued, and that this formed part of a readjustment which brought the composition of these portfolios back closer to their historic averages.  Inflation Report:  August 1999 74 Treasury Chambers, Parliament Street, London, SWIP 3AG 0171-270 5000 18 May 1999 Mr Eddie George Governor Bank of England Threadneedle Street London  EC2R 8AH Dear Eddie REMIT FOR THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE The Bank of England Act requires that I specify what price stability is taken to consist of and the Government’s economic policy objectives at least once in every period of 12 months. The framework has performed well in its first two years.  Both you, as Chairman, and the members of your committee should be congratulated.  Inflation has remained at or around the Government’s target, within 0.2 percentage points over the last ten months.  Inflation is expected to remain close to target:  long-term interest rates are close to their lowest level for over 40 years. I believe the framework’s success reflects a number of factors.  First, the objective of monetary policy is clear and unambiguous, a symmetric inflation target.  Second, the monetary policy framework is open and transparent allowing the public to scrutinise the decisions that are made. Third an equally clear framework for fiscal policy, together with the presence of the Treasury representative at MPC meetings, has ensured the effective coordination of monetary and fiscal policy.  Finally, the high quality of the decisions made reflects the benefits of selecting members on the basis of relevant skills and expertise. Considering the above, I confirm that the MPC’s remit will remain unchanged.  I attach a copy of last year’s remit for ease of reference. Yours sincerely GORDON BROWN  Monetary Policy Committee 75 REMIT FOR THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE The Bank of England Act came into effect on 1 June 1998.  The Act states that in relation to monetary policy, the objectives of the Bank of England shall be: (a) to maintain price stability, and (b) subject to that, to support the economic policy of Her Majesty’s Government, including its objectives for growth and employment. In order to comply with the Act, this remit sets out what price stability should be taken to consist of and what the economic policy of the Government should be taken to be. Price stability I confirm that the operational target for monetary policy remains an underlying inflation rate (measured by the 12-month increase in the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments) of 21/2 per cent.  The inflation target is 21/2 per cent at all times:  that is the rate which the MPC is required to achieve and for which it is accountable. My intention is to lock into our policy making system a commitment to consistently low inflation in the long term.  The real stability that we need will be achieved not when we meet the inflation target one or two months in succession but when we can confidently expect inflation to remain low and stable for a long period of time. The framework takes into account that any economy at some point can suffer from external events or temporary difficulties, often beyond its control.  The framework is based on the recognition that the actual inflation rate will on occasions depart from its target as a result of shocks and disturbances.  Attempts to keep inflation at the inflation target in these circumstances may cause undesirable volatility in output. But if inflation moves away from the target by more than 1 percentage point in either direction I shall expect you to send an open letter to me, following the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee and referring as necessary to the Bank’s Inflation Report, setting out: — the reasons why inflation has moved away from the target by more than 1 percentage point; — the policy action which you are taking to deal with it; — the period within which you expect inflation to return to the target; — how this approach meets the Government’s monetary policy objectives. You would send a further letter after three months if inflation remained more than 1 percentage point above or below the target.  In responding to your letter, I shall, of course, have regard to the circumstances prevailing at the time. The thresholds do not define a target range.  Their function is to define the points at which I shall expect an explanatory letter from you because the actual inflation rate is appreciably away from its target. Government’s economic policy objectives The Government’s central economic objective is to achieve high and stable levels of growth and employment.  Price stability is a precondition for these high and stable levels of growth and employment, which in turn will help to create the conditions for price stability on a sustainable basis.  In the recent past, instability has contributed to the UK’s poor growth performance, not least by holding back the long-term investment that is the foundation for a successful economy. The monetary policy objectives of the Bank of England are to maintain price stability and subject to that, to support the Government’s economic policy, including its objectives for growth and employment. Accountability The Monetary Policy Committee is accountable to the Government for the remit set out in this letter.  The Committee’s performance and procedures will be reviewed by the Court on an ongoing basis (with particular regard to ensuring the Bank is collecting proper regional and sectoral information).  The Bank will be accountable to Parliament through regular reports and evidence given to the Treasury Select Committee.  Finally, through the publication of the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meetings and the Inflation Report, the Bank will be accountable to the public at large. Restatement of the Remit The inflation target will be confirmed in each Budget.  There is a value in continuity and I will have proper regard to that.  But I will also need to consider the case for a revised target at these times on its merits.  Any changes to this remit will be set out in the Budget.  The Budget will also contain a statement of the Government’s economic policy objectives. GORDON BROWN  Inflation Report:  August 1999 76 The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee today voted to reduce the Bank’s repo rate by 0.25% to 5.0%. The Committee considered recent economic developments against the background of the May Inflation Report.  Taking into account all the evidence on the inflation outlook, the Committee judged that it is now more likely that inflation will undershoot the 21/2% target, and therefore voted to reduce the Bank’s repo rate by 0.25%. The minutes of the meeting will be published at 9.30 am on Wednesday 23 June. Text of Bank of England press notice of 10 June 1999 Bank of England reduces interest rates by 0.25% to 5.0%  Monetary Policy Committee 77 Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 7–8 July 1999 1 Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed the world economy;  monetary and financial conditions;  demand and output;  the labour market;  prices and costs;  and other issues relevant to its decision. The world economy 2 The Committee considered whether the gradual improvement in the outlook for the world economy had continued over the past month. 3 In the United States activity had remained robust, although consumption growth had slowed a little.  The Federal Open Markets Committee had raised rates by 25 basis points, accompanying this with a statement that it no longer had a bias to tighten policy.  This had been interpreted by the markets as a sign that the prospect of further increases in official rates was now less immediate than they had believed before, and equity prices had reached new highs.  The timing and extent of any slowdown in activity in the United States remained unclear, and it was possible that growth might stay above trend for longer than previously thought. 4 Business confidence had picked up a little in Germany and France, with orders in Germany and Italy also showing some signs of recovery.  While the steepening of the euro yield curve might reflect some upwards revision in views on activity, this explanation was not consistent with the recent depreciation of the euro.  There was market comment that these recent movements might be explained by an increase in concerns related to the fiscal position in the euro area. 5 In Japan the recorded path of output was likely to be volatile. GDP figures indicated growth of 1.9% in the first quarter of 1999. Adjustments to reflect a variety of factors, such as seasonal adjustment techniques, might lead to the initial estimate of growth in Q1 being revised down, though it might still be above most earlier forecasts.  Even if such a revision were made, GDP might contract in the second quarter.  Nevertheless base money growth continued to pick up, equity prices had risen again and business confidence was a little less weak. 6 GDP forecasts compiled by Consensus Economics for the emerging market economies had generally been revised up over the last month.  However, this was not so for some countries, such as Argentina, where yield spreads for government debt over US Treasuries had also increased.   7 The Committee agreed that the prospects for growth in the world economy were now a little stronger than a month ago, although arguably the uncertainties in the United States had if anything increased.  If growth in the United States remained strong, and if the Asian recovery gathered pace, this might begin to put pressure on non-oil commodity prices, some of which had already begun to rise, as had commodity-related currencies and equities.  It was also argued that the level of world output remained below capacity and no major area except the United States was expected to grow significantly faster than its long-term trend during the coming year or two;  such a persistence of spare capacity in both OECD and emerging market economies would continue to restrain global prices for the time being. Monetary and financial conditions in the United Kingdom 8 Growth in narrow money had risen, with notes and coin growing at their highest rate since end-1996.  This appeared to be consistent with a pick-up in retail sales in Q2.  While broad money growth had eased overall, this had not been reflected in the household component.  It might be that the reductions in official rates were feeding through into broad money growth for households rather faster than expected, but this was by no means certain.  Total household borrowing remained robust, despite some slowing in consumer credit growth. 9 Market expectations for interest rates at the shortest maturities were if anything a little lower than a month ago. However, at the two to three year horizon, interest rates implied by short-sterling futures contracts had increased by around 40 basis points.  This might reflect a market view about the cyclical path of interest rates, particularly if market participants believed that the United Kingdom was now less likely to be part of Economic and Monetary Union in the near future.  Alternatively, the rise in expected UK interest rates might simply reflect the fact that euro rates had risen at the same maturity;  it was not clear whether such a high correlation was warranted.  Standard variable mortgage rates had moved little over the month;  there was not yet much  pass-through into retail rates from last month’s reduction in official rates.  With the steepening in the yield curve, further increases in fixed rates on new mortgages were possible. 10 The effective exchange rate index had fallen a little over the month, and was now close to the central assumption in the May Inflation Report.  It was difficult to tell how much significance should be ascribed to this decline.  Sterling had moved little against the euro, which accounted for two thirds of the exchange rate index, and was of considerable importance for many UK exporters. Sterling had fallen more against the dollar and was outside the range within which it had traded for some time.  The question was raised of whether the significance of such a decline was fully captured by the dollar’s weight in the effective index.  To the extent that the linkage between sterling and the dollar had weakened, sterling’s effective exchange rate might be less susceptible to future movements in the dollar against third currencies. Demand and output 11 While the estimate of GDP growth was unchanged for the first quarter, revisions had been made to the expenditure components.  Growth in consumption was higher than had been thought earlier, and remained strong even when adjusted for a number of special factors, such as a shift in the registration date for new vehicles.  The decline previously indicated for business investment had been reversed, although in overall terms investment was flat because of a steep fall in the general government component, which might reflect erratic timing factors.  Final domestic demand had been revised up, and was now estimated to have grown by over 1% in the quarter.  Much slower stockbuilding and a more negative contribution from net trade (reflecting higher imports) had offset these revisions, leaving the level of GDP unchanged.  It was likely that the lower starting point for stock levels would represent a more secure base for output growth in the coming quarters. 12 Retail sales volumes in the three months to May were over 1% higher than in the previous three months, and survey data also indicated a strengthening in activity, not only in services but also in manufacturing and construction.  However, reports from the Bank’s regional Agents did not suggest much of an improvement in retail conditions, with demand sluggish in many areas. 13 Data from surveys and other published sources had been used to produce estimates for GDP in the second quarter, both by  Inflation Report:  August 1999 78 the National Institute for Economic Research and by Bank staff. These suggested that growth in Q2 could be marginally higher than in the central projection in the May Inflation Report.  Such estimates were subject to error, but appeared to indicate that the recovery in output growth was on track, and that the prospects for activity were slightly better than had appeared a month ago.  One complication, however, was that the annual Blue Book dataset would be published later in July, together with the full Quarterly National Accounts for Q1, and might alter the measured profile of activity for recent years.  But the size and direction of any revisions were not yet known. 14 Indications from the housing market, reflecting data on prices, lending and transactions, all suggested a continuing recovery from the previous autumn.  Developments in this area would require continued monitoring, although they were not yet a cause for concern. 15 On balance, the Committee agreed that the news over  the past month suggested that the projected recovery in activity seemed to be underway and was if anything a little faster than expected. The labour market 16 Data on labour market quantities were also consistent with a somewhat stronger path than had been expected for activity in Q2. Employment had continued to grow, if at a slower pace, with the increase more than accounted for by full-time workers. Unemployment had again declined slightly, reflecting a fall in the numbers of the short-term unemployed.  Despite the slowdown in GDP growth over the past year, the unemployment rate was little changed from its mid-1998 level.  Overall, labour market conditions remained somewhat tighter than had been expected, and the possibility of a substantial rise in unemployment had diminished. 17 By contrast, growth in nominal earnings appeared to be slowing more than expected, with the Average Earnings Index (AEI) showing a decline in earnings growth in the private sector and in services.  The fall in the twelve-month growth rate to April was particularly marked, in part reflecting a fall in bonus payments by comparison with a year ago.  It would be unwise to place too much emphasis on a single month’s figure for the AEI, but there were other signs of a deceleration in private sector nominal earnings, for instance in the Reward index.  The Bank’s matched sample of private sector settlements also showed a decline, from 3.7% a year ago to 3.1% in April, in contrast to the rise in public sector settlements. 18 Reports from the Bank’s regional Agents and the Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services provided less evidence of downwards pressure on pay.  Nor was there any clear downward trend in the growth of earnings on a per hour basis.  In addition, one-year-ahead inflation expectations of trade unionists—as given by the Barclays Basix survey—had fallen by 0.8 percentage points over the past year, rather more than the fall in settlements, indicating that real wages were growing a little faster than a year ago.  Developments in the growth of nominal and real wages therefore seemed to be rather different.  An explanation might be that the effect of a change in inflation expectations on wage settlements was typically less than one-for-one in the short-term. 19 The Committee noted that the National Minimum Wage had come into effect in April and had been expected to raise measures of average earnings.  However, around half of those affected were thought to work in firms which were too small to be covered in the AEI sample.  This increased the difficulties of assessing the impact of the minimum wage on earnings more generally.  It was possible that more of the effect from the National Minimum Wage had been reflected in earnings before April than had previously been assumed. 20 It was possible, however, that any deceleration in nominal earnings might prove temporary.  First, during the past year, RPI inflation had fallen from over 4% to 1.3%.  If this was the measure on which wage bargainers focussed, rather than RPIX, it might help explain the slowdown in earnings growth.  But as the impact of the reduction in interest rates began to fade, growth in RPI would become closer to that of RPIX.  Second, the fall in settlements might reflect the plunge in business confidence in the autumn, when expectations of future profits had been revised down, or the sharp fall in consumer confidence, perhaps due to increasing fears of unemployment.  Since then, survey data pointed to a recovery in business and consumer confidence.  Third, lower bonus payments might reflect lower profits;  if so this might reverse as the economy recovered. 21 However, a temporary downward shock to inflation might persist for some time in so far as the settlements sought by wage bargainers were determined by recent inflation outturns.  It was also possible that supply-side factors, such as the increasing importance of the services sector, falling union membership, and labour market reforms, might have reduced the rate of unemployment at which wage inflation would tend to increase. Prices and costs 22 RPIX inflation had fallen by more than expected in May, foreshadowed by the ONS advance estimate available to the Committee at its June meeting.  This was largely accounted for by food prices, and to that extent the impact on prices two years ahead was unclear.  That depended, in part, on whether the weakness in non-seasonal food prices was transient or reflected a trend towards a compression of retail margins.  Even if the food price weakness were transient, its impact on RPIX two years out would depend on the degree of persistence of the effect of a temporary shock to inflation.  In May, other goods inflation had been marginally weaker than expected and services inflation marginally stronger. The annual retail sales deflator had fallen in the year to May—the first fall since the series began in 1986. 23 Both oil and non-oil commodity prices were higher than a year ago and continuing to rise, and evidence from the Bank’s regional Agents suggested that downwards pressure on import prices might be moderating.  But imported materials prices continued to fall in May, and it was likely that some of the lagged effects of earlier declines in import prices were still to come through to retail prices. 24 Figures for unit labour costs (derived from the wages, employment and output figures), when taken together with price data, suggested that margins might be coming under pressure.  But margins might rise again if demand picked up.  An alternative possibility was that output (and hence productivity) was higher than suggested by present estimates.  In that case potential output could also be higher;  if so, there would be no implications for inflation. 25 The Committee noted that, in the short term, RPIX was likely to remain below 2.5%, but that the extent and duration of any undershoot was uncertain.  It would depend on the extent to which this fed through into inflation expectations, on future movements in margins and the terms of trade, on changes in the output gap, and on how changes in productivity fed through into real wages.  More generally, the outlook for prices given the prospective profile of activity was less clear than the prospects for activity itself, which seemed to be somewhat stronger than earlier expected. Other issues 26 The Committee noted that the analysis and projections to be carried out for the August Inflation Report would allow it to reassess some of the puzzles in the data over the next month:  in particular the contrast between activity, which was somewhat stronger than expected, and prices, which were somewhat weaker.  Monetary Policy Committee 79 In addition, later in July new national accounts data would be published, more information on earnings would become available, and it would be easier to assess the significance of sterling’s recent movements, particularly against the dollar.  While not of themselves conclusive, these were reasons for waiting another month to get a clearer picture of the way in which the economy was developing. The immediate policy decision 27 The Committee identified a variety of arguments for leaving the repo rate unchanged at 5%.  Indicators of activity had strengthened over the past month, both in the United Kingdom and overseas.  The pattern of revisions to GDP in the first quarter, with stronger final domestic demand and imports, and weaker stockbuilding, suggested stronger growth in subsequent quarters. Indications from surveys and retail sales, as well as the money and employment data, also suggested that growth in Q2 would be a little stronger than expected last month.  However, price indicators were weaker than expected.  The sharp fall in the twelve-month growth rate of the Average Earnings Index needed more corroboration, but private sector settlements also appeared to be slowing in nominal terms.  Finally, the exchange rate had eased slightly over the month, particularly against the dollar.  The implication of these factors for inflation over the next two years or so would be examined through the work to be carried out for the August Inflation Report. 28 Further arguments for leaving the repo rate at 5% were advanced.  One was that given the impact of earlier interest rate reductions had yet to be fully seen, official rates should be kept at 5% until evidence emerged of price pressures in either direction.  A second was that rates were now close to their neutral level, and that this was appropriate given the state of the economic cycle and the evidence on employment.  A third argument was that against a background with a significant probability for inflation to undershoot the target in the short term, the Committee might be able to wait and see whether some of the developments, for instance in the labour market, as was looking increasingly likely, reflected structural changes in the economy. 29 On another view, it might have been preferable last month to have left the repo rate unchanged for the reasons set out at the time. Developments over the month had probably strengthened that argument.  Although cost increases were lower than expected, other indicators, such as domestic demand, money data and housing market activity, were pointing to a less benign inflation outlook further ahead, and the exchange rate was back in line with the central assumption in the May Inflation Report.  But there were two reasons for not reversing last month’s reduction.  First, to do so might affect business and consumer confidence disproportionately. A reduction followed by an immediate rise in interest rates, in the absence of significant news about the economy, did not necessarily have the same impact on confidence as a constant level of rates. Second, a reversal might wrongly be interpreted as a stronger signal of the future path of interest rates than was warranted.  It was desirable, therefore, to leave the repo rate unchanged this month. 30 The Governor invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate be maintained at 5.0%.  The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the proposition. 31 The following members of the Committee were present: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers Sushil Wadhwani 32 Gus O’Donnell was present as the Treasury representative.  Inflation Report:  August 1999 80 1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by the Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee on 2 July, in advance of its meeting on 7–8 July 1999.  At the start of the Committee meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and that information is included in the Annex. I The international economy 2 The international environment had improved a little over the month.  Activity in the United States had remained strong, and survey data for the euro area had been largely positive.  Growth forecasts for Asia had been revised up. 3 The final estimate of Q1 GDP growth in the United States had been revised up to 1.1% quarter on quarter, reflecting a slightly less negative contribution from trade.  In Japan, the estimate for Q1 GDP growth had been surprisingly strong, at 1.9% quarter on quarter.  But this most probably overestimated underlying activity. Monthly activity data had suggested weaker growth, and it is possible that some of the public investment reflected orders booked in Q1 that would materialise in Q2.  In the euro area, the preliminary estimate of Q1 GDP growth was 0.4% quarter on quarter, in line with the May Inflation Report projection. Consumption and investment had grown strongly, while net trade and destocking each subtracted from growth.  In Italy, GDP had increased by 0.2% in Q1. 4 The pattern of growth in the major industrialised economies reflected ongoing adjustment to the emerging market crises of the past two years:  net trade had made a negative contribution to growth in the major industrialised economies over the past two quarters.  Industrial production in the United States had remained steady at around 2% at an annual rate.  Data for the euro area as a whole were available only to February.  More timely data were available for some individual economies;  German industrial production had risen by 1.0% in April, but that was still 1.3% lower than a year ago, while French industrial production had fallen by 0.3% in April, and had been flat on the year-on-year comparison. Retail sales data had showed no sign of a slowdown in consumer spending in the United States.  In Japan, retail sales had been stronger than last month, but still lower than a year ago.  In the euro area, lack of timely data and distortions caused by the timing of Easter made retail sales data hard to read;  German retail sales had risen by 4% in March and fallen by 4% in April. 5 In the United States, the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) had increased the Federal Funds target rate by 25 basis points to 5.0% on 30 June and reverted to a neutral stance towards monetary policy.  Interest rates implied by futures contracts had fallen after the FOMC announcement.  Short-term inflation expectations had picked up recently, possibly reflecting the rise in energy prices, but long-run inflation expectations had remained flat. Overall the data suggested that consumption had perhaps slowed a little in Q2, but nevertheless remained robust.  Consumption had risen in May, but sales data suggested a slowdown in June. Consumer confidence and employment, however, had risen further in June.  Some signs of slowing had been apparent in housing sales, but mortgage growth, which appeared to have fuelled consumption, had remained high. 6 The forward-looking information available from surveys indicated a further narrowing of the gap between business and consumer confidence in the euro area in May and June.  Business confidence had risen a little (from a low level) and consumer confidence had fallen slightly (from a higher level).  The IFO survey of business confidence in western Germany and the French INSEE business survey had both risen in May, partly reflecting improvements in foreign orders.  Italian orders had also picked up. In the United States, the National Association of Purchasing Managers Index had risen above market expectations in June, reflecting rises in the sub-indices for production and new orders. The export orders index had also risen.  In Japan, the Tankan survey had shown a small improvement in business sentiment, reflecting better financial conditions. 7 International data on consumer price inflation in  May suggested that the pick-up in April had been temporary.   In the United States, consumer price inflation fell to 2.0%, from 2.3% in April;  for Japan, May’s figure was -0.4%;  and in the  euro area inflation on the harmonised measure had fallen back to 1.0%. 8 Turning to global financial markets, the yen had reached a high of 118 against the dollar around the time of the release of Q1 GDP.  Since then, several rounds of intervention had brought it back into the 120–122 range.  Implied volatility had subsequently fallen sharply.  Japanese bond yields had risen slightly, and equities more markedly, over the month, following the strong GDP data.  In the euro area, expectations of short-term interest rates had risen over the past month. II Monetary and financial conditions 9 Narrow money growth had remained robust.  The  twelve-month growth rate of notes and coin, after adjusting for the introduction of the new 50 pence and £2 coins, had risen to 7.0% in June, the highest rate since December 1996. 10 M4 had risen by £3.4 billion (0.4%) in May.  The annual rate of growth had slowed to 7.0%.  The slowdown in aggregate M4 and aggregate M4 lending had been largely driven by Other Financial Corporations’ (OFCs’) M4 and M4 lending.  OFCs’ M4 deposits had fallen by £2.0 billion in May, and lending to OFCs had fallen by £1.8 billion in May. 11 The M4 deposits of the household sector had risen by 0.6% (or £2.9 billion) in May.  The growth rate of households’ M4 deposits had increased generally since 1998 Q2.  M4 lending to the household sector had remained strong;  it had risen by 0.6% (or £3.1 billion) in May, leaving the twelve-month growth rate unchanged at 7.9%.  Total lending secured on dwellings had fallen from £3.1 billion in April to £2.7 billion in May, although gross lending had remained strong.  Approvals in May had been strong and, reflecting  the current ‘tight’ state of the housing market, many banks and building societies were now allowing consumers to carry approvals forward if their offers were rejected.  This had caused the stock of loan approvals outstanding to rise sharply, and could have altered the relationship between the stock of approvals and secured lending.  Monthly consumer credit growth had fallen from 1.3% in April to 0.6% in May, though this in part could have reflected a switch to mortgage equity withdrawal leaving total borrowing for consumption still strong in 1999 Q2.  Compared with a year earlier, consumer credit growth remained robust at over 17%. 12 Private Non-Financial Corporations’ (PNFCs’) M4 deposits had been strong in May, rising by 2.1% on the month (or  £2.6 billion).  However, this figure had been inflated by a large temporary item;  adjusting for this, the flow in May was negative. Lending to PNFCs had fallen by 0.4% on the month (or £0.8 billion).  The sharp rise in capital issues since the beginning of the year had continued. Annex:  Summary of data presented by Bank staff  Monetary Policy Committee 81 13 Turning to price indicators of monetary conditions, interest rate expectations implied by longer-dated short-sterling futures contracts had risen since the previous MPC meeting:  the rate implied by the September 2001 contract had risen by close to 40 basis points to around 6.80%.  Expectations of interest rates in the euro area and Japan had risen over the month, which might have contributed to the increase in interest rates implied for the United Kingdom. 14 Nominal forward rates at maturities of 3 to 5 years had risen by between 35 and 45 basis points since the previous meeting;  this rise had been in line with the rise in longer-dated short-sterling futures contracts.  Longer rates (beyond about 9 years) had fallen by up to 55 basis points.  This pattern had also been reflected in swap rates and corporate bond yields which rose by similar amounts at 3 to 7-year maturities. 15 Real interest rates derived from the index-linked gilt market had been broadly unchanged since the previous meeting, suggesting that the rise in nominal rates largely reflected increased inflation expectations.  Survey-based measures of inflation expectations available each month had also risen, but by less than those  implied by yield curves.  According to the survey measures, the  rise in nominal interest rates could be split approximately half  and half between a rise in real rates and a rise in inflation expectations. 16 The Consensus Economics Forecasts measure of the expected average inflation rate over the next two years had risen since 1999 Q1 by 20 basis points, to 2.3% in 1999 Q2.  But over the same time period, the Barclays Basix survey suggested that inflation expectations for the next two years had ticked down.  In particular, trade union expectations for the year ahead had fallen from 2.7% in Q1 to 2.5%. 17 The Bank’s survey of advertised interest rates suggested that the 25 basis point cut in the repo rate in June had not been passed through to standard variable mortgage rates.  Moreover, fixed-rate mortgages had risen over the month:  for example, average 5-year fixed mortgage rates with no lock-in had risen by around 20 basis points to 6.20% in June.  Furthermore, spreads between fixed-rate mortgages and swap rates had narrowed in recent months, suggesting that further increases in mortgage rates were possible. Unsecured loan rates and savings rates had been broadly unchanged on the month. 18 The FT-SE All-Share index had risen by around 3% to 3069 since the previous meeting, with small and mid-capitalisation stocks continuing to outperform the FT-SE 100.  Information technology, resources and cyclical consumer goods stocks had performed relatively well over the month. 19 The sterling effective index had fallen by 1.0% since the June meeting to 103.5, approximately 0.1% below the level implied by the central projection of the May Inflation Report.  Sterling had fallen by 0.6% against the euro and 2.6% against the dollar. Movements in sterling over the month appeared largely unrelated to changes in UK yields relative to overseas. III Demand and output 20 According to the latest ONS release, quarterly growth of GDP at constant market prices had been unrevised at 0.0% in 1999 Q1.  But the annual rate had been revised up by  0.1 percentage points to 0.7%, and there had been revisions to the expenditure composition of growth in Q1.  No revisions had been made to previous quarters, pending the release of the full 1999 Q1 National Accounts.  Stronger household consumption and investment in Q1 had been offset by weaker contributions from net trade and stockbuilding.  The difference between final domestic demand and GDP growth had widened in Q1. 21 Quarterly growth of gross value added at constant basic prices had been revised up from -0.1% to 0.0%, with service sector growth revised from 0.2% to 0.4%, largely the result of an upward revision to the transport and communications sector (up from 0.2% to 1.3%).  Excluding the erratic energy and agriculture sectors, the quarterly growth rate of GDP had been 0.2%.  22 Household consumption growth in Q1 had been revised up from 1.1% to 1.4%, the highest quarterly growth rate since 1997 Q2.  Within this, spending on vehicles, household goods, clothing and footwear, and financial services had been particularly strong.  The strength of spending on vehicles had probably been affected by the timing change to new vehicle registrations.  But this had not accounted for all the strength in spending in Q1. 23 Government consumption growth had been unrevised at 1.4% on the previous quarter.  Investment growth in Q1 had  been revised up from an unexpectedly low -1.7% to 0.0%.   Higher business investment, revised up from -2.0% to 1.7%,  had offset a sharp fall in general government investment (-19.2%). The increase in investment had been concentrated in the service sector. 24 On the income side of the accounts, the gross operating surplus of corporations had been revised up from -3.2% to -3.0%. The sharp fall in Q1 had been the largest since 1974 Q1, and was the result of a 4.2% fall in private non-financial corporations, only partially offset by a 4.8% rise in financial corporations.  The fall in gross operating surplus had looked sharp, relative to survey evidence and profits warnings, but the inclusion of the alignment adjustment had had a downward effect on the growth of the  gross operating surplus.  Excluding the alignment adjustment,  the gross operating surplus of private non-financial corporations was flat, although the annual rate was little different (at around 5%). 25 The contribution from stockbuilding to GDP growth had been revised down from -0.2 percentage points to -0.4 percentage points.  But excluding erratic items, the contribution to GDP growth from stockbuilding was estimated to have been around -0.2 percentage points. 26 The Bank’s regional Agents had conducted a survey of their contacts about trends in stock-to-output ratios, both in the recent past and looking to the future.  The contacts had been from the manufacturing, retailing and wholesale sectors.  The Agents had asked how firms’ stock-to-output ratios had changed over the last five years.  The majority of respondents (56%) had reported falling ratios.  When the responses had been weighted according to firms’ turnover, the balance of those reporting rising and falling ratios had been more even.  A majority of retailers had reported a rise in stock-to-output ratios on this basis, while manufacturers had continued on balance to show a fall. 27 The Agents had also asked about the future trend of  stock-output ratios over the next few years—excluding cyclical influences.  A clear majority of respondents had expected their stock-output ratios to fall.  This result had been seen across all three sectors.  In the retailing sector, increased competition, pressure on profit margins and improvements in information technology had been seen as the drivers of the expected reduction in stock levels as a proportion of sales.  A majority of respondents had expected future falls in stock-output ratios to be similar to those in the past, with the exception of retailers. 28 The contribution of net trade to GDP growth had been revised down to -0.7 percentage points from -0.5 percentage points. This had reflected an upward revision to import growth, from 0.3% to 1.1%, which had more than offset the upward revision to export growth (from -1.4% to -1.0%).  The Q1 net trade deficit, at 4.5% of GDP, had been the second highest on record.  Inflation Report:  August 1999 82 29 Retail sales volumes had risen by 1.0% in May, following a revised fall of -0.3% in April.  The three month growth rate (on the previous three months) had risen from 0.6% to 1.1%.  The CBI Distributive Trades survey had suggested continued strength in June with the balance on reported sales at +22, up from +11 in May.  The GfK measure of consumer confidence had suggested robust spending growth in Q2;  the index had been broadly unchanged in June at 5.8. 30 Most indicators had suggested continuing strength in the housing market.  The Nationwide house price index had risen by 0.8% in June;  the Halifax index had risen by 1.8%.  The annual rates of the two indices had moved closer, at 7.5% and 6.6% respectively.  Housing starts had continued to rise from their trough in the autumn of 1998, and the House Builders’ Federation survey balance on net reservations had remained at a strong level despite a slight fall in May.  The improvement in starts was expected to feed through to higher completions and investment in dwellings over time.  Particulars delivered in the three months to May had risen by 3.5% compared with the previous three months, but were 5.4% up on a year earlier.  The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors’ survey had shown a rise in the number of sales per agent in May for the second consecutive month. 31 Construction output had risen by 0.2% in 1999 Q1 and had been broadly flat over the last three quarters.  The volume of orders for new work had been slightly weaker over the last two quarters, but was expected to underpin construction output in the short term. The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) construction survey had indicated rising optimism and orders:  the construction activity index had risen to 64.5 in June from 62.4. Within this, housing activity had risen faster than total construction, consistent with the pick-up in housing market indicators. 32 The outlook for manufacturing output had improved in June. The CIPS activity index had been above 50 for the third consecutive month.  The expected output balance from the CBI survey had been positive in June, for the second month running.  The CBI new orders balance had fallen slightly in June, with manufacturers citing the strong pound and weak European demand.  Industrial production had risen by 0.1% in May.  The CIPS services activity index had been broadly unchanged in June at 56.6.  The new business index, at 58.5, had been at its highest level since March 1998. IV The labour market 33 Employment growth, as measured by the Labour Force Survey (LFS), had slowed further in the three months to April compared with the previous three months, rising by 46,000 (0.2%). Workforce jobs had fallen by around 4,000 in Q1.  There had been an increasing divergence between the two employment measures over the past year.  During this period, LFS employment had risen by around 300,000 whereas Workforce jobs were only 85,000 higher.  The increase in LFS employment during February-April had been more than accounted for by a rise of 57,000 in full-time employment and, consequently, the slowdown in employment growth was less evident in full-time equivalent terms.  Higher employment had been offset by average hours per worker falling by 0.3% from the previous three months.  Total hours had therefore fallen slightly over the quarter (by 0.2%), but overall, had been broadly flat for a year. 34 Turning to survey information, the CIPS manufacturing survey for June showed that employment had fallen further during the month, though the rate of decline had slowed.  In the construction and service sectors employment had expanded further, and at slightly faster rates than they had in May.  The Manpower survey of employment prospects for Q3 had shown little change, with the service and public sectors weaker and the manufacturing sector stronger.  Information from the Bank’s regional Agents suggested that further manufacturing redundancies would be offset by job creation in services, especially in the hotel and transport sectors, where the Working Time Directive was having a significant impact. 35 Data problems persisted with the stock of unfilled vacancies in Northern Ireland and the West Midlands.  Notifications of vacancies had fallen by 15,700 in May, although the trend had been flat.  Overall, there had been no clear news in the vacancies data. 36 Both measures of unemployment had fallen.  LFS unemployment had fallen by 23,000 to 6.2% in February-April, while the claimant count had fallen by 6,500 in May with the  rate unchanged at 4.5%.  On both measures, unemployment  rates had changed little since mid-1998.  The latest fall in LFS unemployment had been mainly among the short-term unemployed. Long-term unemployment had been flat.  Changes in the regional pattern of unemployment had been consistent with the strong growth in service sector activity and the decline in manufacturing activity. 37 Inactivity had risen by 25,000 in the three months to April compared with the previous three months, which represented the first increase since mid-1998.  This increase had been driven by a rise of 50,000 in the number of people who did not want a job. 38 Annual headline earnings growth for the whole economy had fallen from 4.8% to 4.6% in April.  The fall in the headline rate was accounted for by private sector earnings growth, which had fallen by 0.4 percentage points.  Public sector earnings growth had risen by 0.1 percentage points.  The fall in private sector earnings growth had been particularly surprising given the introduction of the National Minimum Wage (NMW) in April, which had been expected to push up earnings growth.  However, it was possible that some firms may have anticipated its introduction and had raised wages before the introduction date.  The largest fall in earnings growth was in the services sector, where earnings had fallen  1.1 percentage points in the twelve months to April.  In manufacturing, on the other hand, annual earnings growth had increased by 0.2 percentage points.  The ONS had said that the fall in earnings growth was partly the result of a broadly based fall in bonuses in the business services sector, and partly the result of some firms paying their bonuses in Q1 rather than in April, as they had done last year.   39 Information from private surveys had suggested that earnings growth was either flat or had fallen slightly.  The Reward index had fallen from 3.9% in April to 3.6% in May.  The Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services survey on salaries and wage rates in June indicated that earnings growth was unchanged, although the survey was based on a small sample.  40 Wage settlements in May had changed little from the previous month.  The twelve-month mean for the whole economy had been unchanged at 3.8%.  The private sector mean had fallen by 0.1 percentage points to 3.7%, while the public sector mean had been unchanged at 4.1%.  In a matched sample, the mean private sector wage settlement in April had fallen by 0.6 percentage points from the same time last year, somewhat less than the fall in inflation expectations over the same period. 41 The annual growth rate in the ONS measure of labour productivity in Q1 had been the weakest since 1991, rising by only 0.5%.  A new productivity survey produced by NTC Research and the Institute of Management Services had suggested a sharp pick-up in productivity growth in Q2.  Growth in unit wage costs had risen again in Q1, as wages and salaries had grown faster than productivity. V Prices 42 The Bank’s index of commodity prices including oil had risen by 0.6% in May, following strong rises in March and April.  Monetary Policy Committee 83 The index excluding oil had also risen, by 0.2%.  But annual inflation in both indices had fallen:  to 3.4% (from 4.0%) for the oil-inclusive index and 1.4% (1.7%) excluding oil.  The oil price had risen slightly over the month and exceeded $18 per barrel on  6 July. 43 Producer input prices had fallen by 0.5% in May and the year-on-year inflation rate had fallen back to -2.6% from -1.1% in April.  Imported materials prices had continued to fall.  Evidence from the CIPS survey had suggested continued but slowing deflation in the near future.  The output price level, whether including or excluding excise duties, had been unchanged in May.  Total import prices had risen by 0.2% in April, but prices for imports from the non-EU countries had fallen by 0.1% in May.  Export prices had risen more sharply—by 0.7% to all countries in April and by 0.5% to non-EU countries in May. 44 The rate of GDP deflator inflation in the first quarter had been revised up by 0.1 percentage points on both a quarterly and annual basis (to 0.4% and 2.2% respectively) in the third release  of the GDP data.  The retail sales deflator fell for the third consecutive month in May, leading to negative annual inflation  for the first time in the series’ history.  The annual rate of inflation on the harmonised index had fallen by 0.2 percentage points to 1.3% in May, equalling its lowest rate since the series started in 1988. 45 The annual rate of RPIX inflation had fallen sharply, to 2.1%, in May.  The rates of RPIY and RPI inflation had also fallen to 1.5% and 1.3% respectively.  The fall was largely due to lower food and other goods prices, and had continued the recent pattern where goods price inflation had fallen but services inflation  had remained fairly constant.  Inflation in April and May had  been markedly weaker than the central projection in the May Inflation Report forecast.  This was entirely because of goods price inflation. VI Reports by the Bank’s Agents 46 The Bank’s regional Agents had reported on their general discussions with contacts.  The manufacturing recovery had been fragile, but business expectations had improved.  And whereas business and financial services had shown ongoing growth, the outlook for consumer services had remained weak. 47 Retail sales had stayed weak.  Only discount stores had recorded significant strengthening in activity.  Generally, discounting had continued to be widespread.  The evidence for other non-retail consumer expenditure had been mixed. 48 Exports to the United States had continued to be strong.  The East Asian market on the other hand remained depressed, though the outlook had improved.  Demand from Europe had remained weak, particularly from Germany and Italy.  Sterling’s persistent strength was seen as the main obstacle to rising European orders. 49 Manufacturing employment had fallen further, in contrast to the service sector where employment intentions had firmed.  Skill shortages and pay pressures had persisted.  50 Overall, the view had been that activity in Q2 had turned out stronger than in Q1, though the latter had been perceived as very weak. VII Market intelligence 51 Short-term expectations for UK interest rates had fallen since the previous MPC meeting.  For longer maturities, however, rates had risen by around 40 basis points, having been up by 70 basis points or so at one stage.  Changes in the shape of the yield curve could be partially attributed to international influences, such as the decision by the FOMC to raise rates, and to shifts in the market’s view on UK entry to EMU and hence the future path of UK rates. In the more immediate future most market participants did not expect a further cut in the repo rate this month, given the retail sales data, evidence from surveys and house price data, although some believed that it was possible in the next few months if inflation continued to be below expectations. 52 Sterling had, over the last month, continued to depreciate against the dollar, reaching its lowest level since September 1996, with talk that it had moved into a new trading range.  The changing pattern of differentials in official interest rates internationally was thought by many to be an important factor, as were signs of growth in other economies.  For these reasons corporate demand for sterling had been less apparent at these levels than before.  Data from options markets had suggested that the market saw risks as being on the downside for sterling against both the euro and the dollar.

1999-11-10,"Inflation Report November 1999 The Inflation Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff  under the guidance of the members of the Monetary  Policy Committee.  It serves two purposes.  First,  its preparation provides a comprehensive and  forward-looking framework for discussion among MPC  members as an aid to our decision making.  Second, its  publication allows us to share our thinking and explain  the reasons for our decisions to those whom they affect. Although not every member will agree with every  assumption on which our projections are based, the fan  charts represent the MPC’s best collective judgment  about the most likely path for inflation and output, and the  uncertainties surrounding those central projections.

Since last year’s global economic turbulence, robust domestic consumption and capital investment have contrasted with weak net trade and stockbuilding.  But with activity in the world economy recovering and stocks in better balance, the dampening effect of these latter factors has moderated.  So too have downward international price pressures—indeed producer input prices are now rising—though sterling has again strengthened.  The labour market is tightening, and nominal pay growth is no longer easing.  Nevertheless, inflation on the RPIX measure has been below the 21/2% target for the past six months. The international economic outlook has improved further since the August Report. Robust growth with low inflation—but with a still widening trade deficit—has continued in the United States.  Forward-looking indicators point to strengthening activity in the euro area, and there are further signs of recovery in Japan. Prospects for many emerging market economies have also improved.  Substantial risks remain—for example from the possibilities of asset price falls—but the  overall picture is brighter.  Partly in view of this, a number of commodity prices have picked up further, notably oil.  And since the August Report, monetary policy has been tightened in the United States and in the euro area. Output in the UK economy is estimated to have grown by 0.9% in the third quarter, significantly higher than expected three months ago.  Estimated growth in the first half of the year has also been revised up.  The annual rate of GDP growth is now 1.8%.  Growth has been strongest in service sector industries, but manufacturing output has also risen in recent months. Final domestic demand—especially household consumption—has continued to grow strongly, and was 4.5% higher in the second quarter than a year before. Having significantly lowered overall demand for UK output since mid 1997, net trade—exports less imports— made a positive contribution to growth in Q2, and exports have continued to grow since then as world trade has picked up.  Rising demand has been met in part by a rundown in stocks.  If net trade and stockbuilding  ii Inflation Report:  November 1999 stabilise, the growth rate of final domestic demand will need to ease in order to keep overall demand in line with the economy’s supply capacity. The recovery from last autumn’s low points in a wide range of business survey indicators, including manufacturing as well as services, has been maintained. Reports from the Bank’s regional Agents confirm expectations of a positive near-term outlook for most business sectors.  However, a number of recent surveys point to a pick-up in cost pressures. Narrow money growth remains firm, but broad money growth has weakened further, to its lowest rate on record.  This weakness is largely accounted for by a sharp reversal of the previous expansion of deposits by non-bank financial corporations.  Household borrowing—to finance house purchase and other consumption—has been buoyant, and housing market strength appears increasingly broad-based.  The Bank’s official interest rate was increased by 0.25% to 5.25% in September, and by a further 0.25% to 5.5% in November.   Unemployment has fallen further—to 5.9% on the Labour Force Survey measure and to 4.2% on the claimant count.  Employment growth, total hours worked, vacancies, and measures of employment intentions have all picked up.  Survey evidence and reports from the Bank’s regional Agents suggest that recruitment difficulties have increased in some areas and for some types of skill, but not uniformly.  Overall, however, labour market conditions have tightened in recent months. Nominal pay growth as measured by the Average Earnings Index rose to 4.9% in the three months to August, largely on account of higher growth in private sector pay in the services industries.  However, wage settlements have on average remained broadly flat.   Pay growth in real terms has been rising for some time on most measures, but this might in part reflect  lower-than-expected price inflation, as well as labour market tightness.   Sterling has again strengthened since the summer, and the starting-point for the projections below is an effective exchange rate index (ERI) of 105.6, which is about 3% above the central path assumed in the August Report. As before, there is considerable uncertainty about exchange rate prospects.  The projections below assume,  iii Overview in the central case, that sterling’s ERI declines to 101.8 at the two-year forecast horizon.  This is half the decline that would be implied by interest rate differentials. Exchange rate assumptions are discussed further in Section 6. On the assumptions agreed as the MPC’s best collective judgment, the prospects for GDP growth—with the official interest rate remaining at 5.5%—are as shown in Chart 1.  The chart reflects the sharper-than-expected recovery in growth that has occurred so far this year. Otherwise the profile is broadly similar to the August projection, though consumption is stronger, and net trade is weaker because of the stronger exchange rate.  In the central projection, annual growth is somewhat above trend—between 2.5% and 3%—throughout the two-year forecast period.   On those same assumptions, the Committee’s best collective judgment of the prospects for RPIX inflation is shown in Chart 2.  The most likely outcome is for inflation to decline to just below 2% over the next year or so, before rising to the 21/2% target by the two-year forecast horizon.  Relative to the August projection, upward pressure on inflation from stronger domestic demand and earnings growth is broadly offset by downward pressure from the higher exchange rate path and declining price-cost margins.   There are considerable uncertainties surrounding these projections.  Particular uncertainties exist in relation to the path of the exchange rate, earnings, and price-cost margins.  Alternative judgments about these issues led some Committee members to prefer a profile for inflation that would be higher or lower than that shown in Chart 2—by 1/4% to 1/2% at the two-year forecast horizon. The economy is currently enjoying stronger growth and lower inflation than previously anticipated.  But the medium-term outlook for inflation is less benign. Because monetary policy decisions take time to work through the economy, interest rates must be set with a view to influencing prospective inflation, uncertain though that is.  Delivering price stability is the contribution that monetary policy can make towards sustained growth.  That requires vigilance to keep prospective inflation on target.  To that end, monetary policy has been tightened pre-emptively since the summer to counter the prospect of inflationary pressures building in the medium term.

(a) Deflated by RPIX inflation. The MPC voted to raise the Bank’s repo rate by  0.25 percentage points to 5.25% on 8 September, and voted to maintain the rate at that level at its meeting in October.  At its November meeting, the MPC voted to raise the Bank’s repo rate by a further 0.25 percentage points to 5.5%.  Since the August Report, short-term market interest rates have risen somewhat, although long-term rates are little changed. The sterling exchange rate has appreciated by nearly 3% on a trade-weighted basis since the August Report, having risen against both the US dollar and the euro. House price inflation remains high, and that strength appears more widespread across regions than at the time of the August Report, but aggregate equity prices are at similar levels to those three months ago. Growth in narrow money remains fairly strong, but aggregate broad money growth is historically low, owing in large part to a further contraction in the deposits of non-bank financial corporations.  Secured lending to households has continued to grow strongly. 1.1 Money and credit Narrow money The value of notes and coin in circulation grew by 7.3% in the year to October (see Table 1.A), the same rate as at the time of the August Report.(1) Annual real narrow money growth has varied between 3% and 5% for much of the past five years, and is currently towards the top of this range (see Chart 1.1).  Some of the recent rise in real narrow money holdings is likely to reflect the lower level of interest rates relative to a year ago, which has reduced the opportunity cost of holding cash.  Growth in real narrow money may also signal future growth in real aggregate demand, so robust real narrow money growth seems consistent with the projection of strong output growth over the near-term forecast period. Looking ahead, there are two special factors that are likely to raise the stock of notes and coin around the turn of the year.  First, the winter allowance for pensioners Table 1.A Growth rates of notes and coin, M4 and  M4 lending Per cent 3 months (a) 6 months (a) 12 months Notes and coin Aug. 1999 8.8 8.4 7.6 Sept. 6.4 7.4 6.7 Oct. 6.4 7.8 7.3 M4 Q4  1998 6.2 7.7 8.2 Q1  1999 3.5 4.8 6.9 Q2 2.6 3.1 5.4 Q3  -0.9 0.9 2.8 M4 lending Q4  1998 5.6 7.6 7.7 Q1  1999 7.0 6.3 7.2 Q2   8.0 7.5 7.6 Q3 6.6 7.3 6.8 Source:  Bank of England. (a) Annualised.

Second, the Millennium is likely to add temporarily to narrow money holdings, mainly because of the extra bank holiday and additional celebration-related expenditure, although the quantitative impact of these factors is uncertain. Broad money Broad money growth fell in the third quarter of 1999, lowering the twelve-month growth rate to 2.8%. Although the M4 measure was first adopted in 1987, it is possible to construct data back to 1963, and this shows that the current annual growth rate is the lowest on record.  But significant sectoral differences persist.  The deposits of households and private non-financial corporations (PNFCs) have been growing at a fairly steady rate since 1995, whereas growth in the deposits of other financial corporations (OFCs) has been extremely variable (see Chart 1.2).  Having grown strongly between 1995 and 1998, OFCs’ deposits have contracted so far in 1999.  As discussed below, it seems unlikely that the behaviour of OFCs’ deposits has major implications for aggregate demand, so some caution is required when interpreting the aggregate broad money growth figures. Excluding OFCs from the M4 data, broad money growth was a little weaker in the third quarter, although the fall was much less marked than in the aggregate series (see Chart 1.3). An alternative measure of broad money that may be more indicative of nominal demand is Divisia.  Deposits that are more liquid are given a higher weight in the Divisia index, where liquidity is assumed to be inversely related to the rate of interest paid on the deposit. Aggregate Divisia grew by 4.9% in the year to 1999 Q3, 1.2 percentage points lower than in the second quarter. But annual growth in household Divisia has been higher—at around 7%—during the first three quarters of this year, which seems consistent with the relative strength of consumer spending over this period. Bank and building society lending to the rest of the private sector (M4 lending) grew at an annualised rate of 6.6% in the third quarter, weaker than in the first half of the year.  The twelve-month growth rate slowed to 6.8%, the lowest rate since 1995 Q1.  But as with M4 deposits, the aggregate M4 lending data mask some important sectoral differences.  As discussed below, borrowing by households remains strong, and the recent weakness in PNFCs’ borrowing from banks and building societies has  Money and financial markets 5 been offset by higher borrowing from sterling capital markets. Household sector Household deposits grew by 6.4% in the year to  1999 Q3, 0.4 percentage points lower than in the second quarter, but little different from the growth rates seen over the past four years.  Growth in households’ borrowing from banks and building societies, on the other hand, has picked up strongly in the second and third quarters of 1999.  In the year to Q3, households’ M4 borrowing rose by 8.2%, the highest rate since the fourth quarter of 1991.  A broader measure of lending to individuals, which includes lending by institutions other than banks and building societies, shows similar buoyancy (see Chart 1.4). Secured lending has continued to grow rapidly, rising by 7.6% in the year to 1999 Q3.  It seems likely that this strength will continue in the near future.  There have been large additions to the stock of loan approvals during most of this year (see Chart 1.5), and it seems likely that this stock is around its highest level for a decade, even after adjusting for inflation.  Unless loan cancellations pick up or there is a sharp rise in repayments of existing borrowing, a large stock of approved loans will result in higher net lending in the future. New lending secured on housing that is not used for house purchase or home improvements is termed mortgage equity withdrawal (MEW).  The Bank’s estimate of MEW rose again in the second quarter, and as a proportion of post-tax income reached its highest level since 1992 Q1, although it remains well below levels seen in the late 1980s.  Higher MEW might be associated with increased consumer spending, particularly on household goods and consumer durables (see Section 2).  MEW is discussed further in the box on page 6. Annual growth in consumer credit remains strong in relation to nominal spending, but fell by 0.7 percentage points to 13.7% in the third quarter.  The change in the registration date for new car sales—from once a year in August to twice a year in March and September—is likely to have affected the seasonal pattern of consumer credit.  The flow of lending in August might be lower than in the past, while lending in March and September might be rather higher.  But it will be some time before the quantitative impact can be gauged with any accuracy.

Inflation Report:  November 1999 6 Mortgage equity withdrawal Mortgage equity withdrawal (MEW) is new borrowing secured on housing that is not invested in the housing stock.  The Bank’s estimate of private sector MEW was positive in the first half of 1999, having been negative for much of the decade, although it remains well below levels seen in the late 1980s. The figure below illustrates the factors that enter into the Bank’s estimate of MEW.  On the one hand, an increase in mortgage lending raises the stock of housing finance, as do capital grants paid to the private sector.  Repayments and redemptions reduce the stock of housing finance.  On the other side of the equation, the private sector’s housing investment increases with purchases of new houses, purchases of existing houses from other sectors (such as council house sales), and with home improvements.  The Bank estimates MEW as the difference between the change in the stock of housing finance and the private sector’s net housing investment. Because MEW is a form of household borrowing, it may be thought of as an alternative to personal loans, overdraft facilities and credit card borrowing.  As such, some elements of MEW will be driven by the same influences as other forms of household borrowing, such as income, wealth and interest rates.  But MEW will also depend on a number of housing market factors.  For example, a household will be able to withdraw equity through remortgaging only if the house has net equity above a certain minimum level.  This suggests that MEW may rise following increases in house prices.  (Note that although changes in house prices will affect the value of the housing stock—and therefore housing equity—they do not enter into the calculation of the flow of equity withdrawal.)  MEW is also likely be related to housing transactions.  First, because there are fixed costs to arranging a mortgage, households may be more likely to withdraw equity when they are already engaged in a housing transaction.  Second, if equity is released by ‘last time sales’ (eg sales that occur upon death or emigration, or sales of second homes), the withdrawal occurs simultaneously with a housing transaction.  As the chart shows, MEW has in the past been positively correlated with housing transactions as measured by particulars delivered to the Land Registry. Although some housing equity may be withdrawn with the specific purpose of funding consumption, funds raised through equity withdrawal could also be put to a variety of other uses, such as the purchase of financial assets, investment in businesses or transfers abroad.  And because MEW is secured borrowing—and so generally incurs a lower interest cost than unsecured borrowing— households may use MEW to pay off unsecured debt.

Private non-financial corporations (PNFCs) Annual growth in PNFCs’ M4 deposits slowed further to 4.9% in the third quarter, almost half the annual growth rate six months earlier.  The recent behaviour of PNFCs’ deposits is likely to have been affected by the abolition of Advance Corporation Tax (ACT) that was announced in the 1998 Budget, and by the strength in PNFCs’ capital issues.  The abolition of ACT may have led firms to delay the payment of dividends until the 1999–2000 tax year, and this might account for some of the strong  build-up in deposits in the first quarter of the calendar year and the rundown in the second and third quarters. Annual growth in PNFCs’ borrowing from banks and building societies fell to 4.2% in the third quarter,  0.5 percentage points lower than in 1999 Q2.  But the relative weakness in PNFCs’ sterling borrowing from banks and building societies in recent quarters was offset by sterling capital market issuance, which has been strong in each of the first three quarters of 1999 (see Chart 1.6).  Funds raised in capital markets may be used as a direct substitute for borrowing from banks and building societies.  And market contacts have suggested that some of the strength in capital market issues is the result of companies bringing forward planned capital issuance, owing to concerns about financial market liquidity around the turn of the year.  Higher capital issuance may also be related to business investment, which remained relatively high in the first half of 1999. Other financial corporations (OFCs) OFCs’ deposits contracted for the third consecutive quarter in 1999 Q3, and have fallen by 7.7% over the past year.  Annual growth in M4 lending to OFCs slowed to 5.4% in the third quarter, down from 10% in Q2. The share of OFCs’ deposits in aggregate M4 has increased markedly over the past two decades, rising from around 5% in 1980 to its current level of more than 20% (see Chart 1.7).  So movements in OFCs’ deposits have a much greater influence on the aggregate M4 growth rate than in the past.  This is problematic for two reasons.  First, OFCs’ deposits have been more variable than those of other sectors, raising the volatility of the aggregate data.  Second, the usefulness of aggregate broad money as an indicator of nominal demand is diminished, as OFCs’ activity involves little direct interaction with the markets for goods and services. (One exception to this is financial leasing corporations, but they account for only around 3% of OFCs’ deposits.)

Inflation Report:  November 1999 8 Around 60% of the stock of OFCs’ deposits is held by other financial institutions and financial auxiliaries (OFIFAs), such as securities dealers and investment and unit trusts, with the remainder held by insurance companies and pension funds (ICPFs).  The deposits of both of these sub-groups have contracted over the past year.  Nearly 80% of the fall in OFIFAs’ deposits can be accounted for by a fall in the deposits of securities dealers.  Movements in the latter are a by-product of securities dealers’ financial intermediation business, and have no obvious implications for aggregate spending. ICPFs hold deposits mainly for portfolio reasons, and their money holdings therefore depend on expected rates of return on an array of financial assets and on attitudes towards risk-bearing.  Although there may be spillovers from ICPFs’ deposits to those of the non-financial private sector if the former purchase financial assets from the latter, such transfers are usually hard to identify, even  ex post. 1.2 Interest rates and asset prices Short-term interest rates The Bank’s repo rate currently stands at 5.5%, compared with 5% at the time of the August Report.  Market rates suggest that investors are expecting the official rate to rise further, but an accurate quantification of market expectations of official rates is not easy to obtain. Forward rates implied by short sterling futures prices are sometimes cited as the best guide to the market’s view of the future profile of official interest rates.  Three-month forward Libor rates implied by short sterling futures prices show a peak of around 7.25% in December 2001 (see Chart 1.8).  But the relation between short sterling futures rates and official rates is not straightforward. Aside from the maturity mis-match—three-month Libor compared with the official rate which has a maturity of around two weeks—short sterling futures rates contain default and liquidity premia that are not present in the official repo rate.(1) These premia vary both with maturity and over time, and appear to have increased recently at the very short end of the curve, perhaps owing to concerns about liquidity and credit risk over the year end. Chart 1.9 shows two-week forward interest rates derived from the prices of government bonds and gilt repo rates as at 4 August and 3 November 1999, using a new yield Chart 1.8 Short sterling futures rates 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0 1999 2000 01 02 4 August 3 November  Per cent 0.0 03 Source:  Bloomberg.

Money and financial markets 9 curve estimation technique developed by Bank staff.(1) The new technique has improved the fit and stability of the yield curve, and provides more reliable estimates of forward rates at short maturities.  The chart shows that forward rates have risen by around 50 basis points at the very short end of the yield curve since the August Report, with a peak just below 6.5% around 18 months ahead.  Gilt repo rates are free of many of the risk premia contained in short sterling futures rates, so this curve is likely to provide a better guide to market expectations of future official rates.  But technical factors mean that market gilt repo rates tend to be lower than the official repo rate, so that market expectations of official rates probably lie a little above those shown in Chart 1.9. Forward rates from the new yield curve, with an appropriate upward adjustment, are now used to measure market expectations of future official rates in the MPC’s projections for RPIX inflation and GDP growth. Chart 1.10 shows the risk-neutral probability distribution of three-month sterling interest rates derived from  the prices of options on short sterling futures on  3 November 1999, using the contracts up to  September 2000.  Uncertainty about future short-term interest rates, as measured by the variance of the distribution, has fallen since the August Report. In the market’s view, the risks to short-term interest rates are a little on the upside. Previous Reports noted that there was relatively little movement in retail interest rates following the official repo rate cuts in April and June.  Similarly, retail rates remained little changed following the September repo rate rise, so the cumulative change in retail rates over the past year is now broadly in line with repo rate changes over that period (see Chart 1.11).  The Bank’s measure of the average standard variable mortgage rate (SVR) has been relatively flat during 1999, but fixed mortgage rates have risen sharply (see Chart 1.12).  Higher fixed rates might indicate that expectations of future SVRs have been revised upwards. Long-term interest rates Over the quarter as a whole, long-term bond yields are little changed.  The ten-year nominal spot yield on gilts stood at 5.2% on 3 November, the same level as at the time of the August Report.  US and euro-area long-term nominal bond yields have similarly shown little net Chart 1.11 Cumulative changes in repo rate and selected retail rates since September 1998 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 Oct.

At any given point, the depth of shading represents the height of the probability density function implied by the markets over a range of outcomes for short-term interest rates.  The markets judge that there is a 10% chance of interest rates being within the darkest, central band at any date.  Each successive pair of bands covers a further 10% of the probability distribution until 90% of the distribution is covered.  The bands widen as the time horizon is extended, indicating  increased uncertainty about interest rate outcomes.  Inflation Report:  November 1999 10 movement over this period.  And the real ten-year spot yield implied by the prices of index-linked gilts was 2.1% on 3 November, again the same level as in August. Equity prices Aggregate UK equity prices are around the same level as at the time of the August Report (see Table 1.B).  Other major world equity markets have been more upbeat. Equity prices rose by nearly 4% in the United States, and by nearly 9% in the euro area.  Japanese equity prices were 4% higher than in August, and have now risen by more than 30% since the start of the year. Property prices House price inflation remains high.  The Halifax and Nationwide house price indices show increases of 10.8% and 11.6% respectively in the year to October 1999 (see Chart 1.13).  Although marked regional differences remain, house price inflation appears more broadly based than at the time of the August Report;  according to the Halifax, six of the twelve regions saw house prices rise by more than 5% in 1999 Q3, compared with only two regions in the second quarter (see Chart 1.14). Some of the recent rise in house prices is likely to be related to reductions in mortgage rates around the turn of the year.  To the extent that there are lags in the transmission from lower mortgage rates to higher house prices, house price inflation may remain high for some time.  Moreover, employment and labour income continue to grow, and consumer confidence remains  high (see Section 2).  These factors may support further house price increases.  But the rise in fixed mortgage rates discussed above may have some dampening effect on house prices.  The MPC has maintained the assumption in its central projection that house prices will grow at around twice the pace of average earnings over the next two years. Commercial property returns have continued to recover. According to Investment Property Databank Ltd, aggregate property returns were around 4% in the second and third quarters of 1999, double the figure for the fourth quarter of 1998.  The recovery has been strongest for offices and industrial property, with a slightly less pronounced recovery in retail property returns (see  Chart 1.15).  The Merrill Lynch survey of UK fund managers continues to show a positive balance of those increasing their holding of UK property.

Money and financial markets 11 Exchange rates The sterling effective exchange rate index (ERI) is nearly 3% higher than at the time of the August Report (see Chart 1.16).  In bilateral terms, sterling rose by 4% against the euro and by 1.3% against the US dollar, but fell by 7% against the yen.  The MPC’s decision to increase the Bank’s repo rate on 8 September came largely as a surprise to the financial markets, and the sterling ERI rose by nearly 1% on that day, and has since risen by a further 2%. 1.3 Summary Short-term interest rates have risen and the sterling exchange rate has appreciated since the August Report, but long-term nominal and real interest rates are broadly unchanged.  Fixed mortgage rates have risen, suggesting that expectations of future standard variable rates have been revised upwards, and this may have some dampening effect on housing market activity. Nevertheless, house price inflation remains strong, and commercial property returns have continued to recover. UK equity prices, on the other hand, are little changed. Narrow money growth remains fairly strong.  Broad money growth has fallen to its lowest recorded level, although movements in the aggregate figure continue to be dominated by the non-bank financial sector.  Secured lending to individuals remains robust, and this strength seems likely to continue in the near term.

GDP rose by 0.9% in 1999 Q3.  Economic activity has strengthened more quickly than expected at the time of the August Report and the recovery in consumer and business confidence has proved to be resilient.  Final domestic demand has increased rapidly this year, underpinned by buoyant consumer spending.  But the impact of strong final domestic demand on activity was dampened by a further weakening of net trade in the first quarter and a rundown in inventories in the first half of the year.  Activity has picked up as those effects appear to have moderated.  In particular, net trade has stabilised and made a positive contribution to GDP growth in Q2, for the first time in seven quarters.  2.1 External demand(1) Two main developments have affected external demand for UK exports over the past three years.  First, the appreciation of sterling which began in the second half of 1996 depressed demand for UK exports.  Second, the contraction of activity in emerging markets in late 1997 and in 1998 reduced world demand and world trade growth, and that had a further impact on UK exports. Export volumes were 1.4% lower than a year earlier at the beginning of 1999 but have risen since then as world activity and trade have improved. The slowdown in world activity was less pronounced than expected towards the end of 1998, and the recovery has begun earlier than expected at the time of the May and August Reports.  Growth this year in the industrial countries has been stronger than expected by the IMF (see Table 2.A).  The contraction of activity in emerging market economies has been less than projected at the end of 1998 and the return to growth has been faster than anticipated, though conditions in a number of emerging economies remain fragile.  These developments have prompted many forecasters—including the IMF—to forecast higher world growth for 2000 than for 1999 (see Chart 2.1). Turning to the major industrialised countries, growth in the United States picked up in 1999 Q3 to 1.2% from Table 2.A IMF projections for GDP and trade growth  Per cent Share Projections of world 1998 (a) 1999 (a) 2000 (b) GDP Outturn Revision New Revision New Revision GDP: World 2.5 0.3 3.0 0.8 3.5 0.1 G7 44.4 2.2 0.1 2.6 1.1 2.4 0.4 of which, Japan 7.4 -2.8 0.0 1.0 1.5 1.5 1.2 NIEs (c) 3.2 -1.8 0.8 5.2 4.7 5.1 0.6 Developing  economies 39.8 3.2 0.4 3.5 0.0 4.8 -0.1 Countries in  transition  4.8 -0.2 0.6 0.8 2.7 2.8 0.3 World trade 3.6 0.3 3.7 -0.7 6.2 0.4 Source:  IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO), October 1999.

Final domestic demand growth remained above 1% for the fourth quarter in a row.  Net trade detracted from growth as imports again increased rapidly.  Euro-area growth was a little higher than in the previous quarter in Q2 and surveys point to stronger growth in the second half of the year.  Growth resumed in Japan in the first half of 1999, primarily as a result of higher private consumption. Although the recovery remains fragile, growth forecasts for Japan have been revised up substantially for 1999 and 2000, accounting for much of the upward revision to the Asia Pacific region (see Chart 2.2). Consistent with the information from external forecasts of world growth and the improved prospects for emerging markets, the MPC’s central projection for world activity is a little higher than at the time of the August Report.  The risks around the central projection for world activity, however, are judged to be on the downside, as in August.  For example, one risk is  the possibility that the slowdown in the US economy might be more pronounced than assumed in the central case.  The fall in UK exports of goods and services in 1998 was largely accounted for by a contraction of exports to East Asia.  As a result, East Asia’s share of UK exports fell to 7.6% in 1998 compared with an average of close to 10% in the previous five years (see Table 2.B).  In recent months, however, exports to the Asian economies have recovered significantly, exports to North America have grown at a fast pace, and—since June—export volumes to EU countries have also risen (see Chart 2.3). Therefore, overall export volumes have begun to rise. UK export volumes of goods and services rose by 2.1% in 1999 Q2 following two quarters of decline, and monthly data suggest that export volumes rose again in 1999 Q3. The prospects for UK exports depend on developments in the exchange rate as well as world activity.  Sterling’s real effective exchange rate index has risen since the beginning of the year (see Chart 2.4), and the nominal effective rate has risen by around 3% since August.  That would tend to moderate the growth of exports over the next year or so.  But recent surveys of exporters suggest that, to date, the strengthening of world demand has had a larger effect on measures of business export prospects than recent exchange rate developments.  The BCC manufacturing survey balances pointed to an increase in export orders in Q3.  The falls in export orders reported Table 2.B Destination of UK exports of goods and  services(a) Regional shares, per cent 1996 1997 1998 European Union  52.0 50.5 52.2 Other European countries  8.0 8.1 8.0 North America  15.8 16.6 17.6 Latin America  2.2 2.5 2.9 East Asia including Japan 9.7 9.6 7.6 Saudi Arabia 1.9 2.4 2.0 Rest of the world  10.4 10.4 9.7 (a)  Current prices.

Inflation Report:  November 1999 14 by the CBI survey has moderated since the end of 1998, and optimism about the prospects for exports in the year ahead has become less negative.  UK import volume growth for goods and services has slowed since the end of 1997 and the annual growth rate dipped to 4.8% in 1992 Q2, the lowest since the beginning of 1995.  The slowdown in import volume growth appears surprising given the strength of consumers’ expenditure and earlier falls in import prices relative to the prices of domestically produced goods. The relative weakness of import volume growth may have reflected a desire by firms to reduce inventory levels, and importers may have underestimated the strength of UK demand in the first half of the year.  The slowdown in import volume growth looks to have been temporary.  Chart 2.5 shows that import volumes of goods have picked up in recent months, and this has occurred across all major commodity groups.  In 1999 Q2, the marked pick-up in export volumes and relatively weak import volume growth meant that net trade made a positive contribution of 0.5 percentage points to quarterly GDP growth, the first positive contribution since 1997 Q3.  Faster growth of export volumes than import volumes in recent months is likely to have resulted in another positive contribution from net trade in Q3.  Looking further ahead, the MPC expects UK export volumes to continue to rise reflecting the strengthening of world demand, though the recent rise in sterling is likely to restrain rates of growth.  Import volumes are expected to increase at a faster rate, in line with stronger domestic demand.  Net trade is therefore expected to make negative contributions to GDP growth in 2000 and 2001, though less so than in the recent  past. 2.2 Domestic demand UK final domestic demand, which excludes inventories, was 4.5% higher than a year earlier in Q2.  It grew by 0.9% in 1999 Q2, following an increase of 1.3% the previous quarter.  That contrasted with slower growth of domestic demand of 0.2%, as inventory levels were run down sharply (see Table 2.C).  Final domestic demand can be met from domestic production, imports or a change in inventory holdings. Growth in final domestic demand can therefore diverge substantially from GDP growth when there are large movements in net trade or when there are substantial Chart 2.4 Sterling real effective exchange rate(a) 1980 82 84 86 88 90 92 94 96 98 70 80 90 100 120 140 160 1990 = 100 150 130 110 Narrow real ERI (a) Broad real ERI (b) Sources:  IMF, International Financial Statistics.

Chart 2.6 shows that the annual average growth of final domestic demand has been at or above that of GDP since 1995.  The gap between final domestic demand and GDP growth has widened over the period to reach 3 percentage points in the year to 1999 Q2.  Alongside 1988 Q1, that was the biggest annual difference in any quarter since the 1950s. Net trade made large negative contributions to annual average GDP growth between 1996 and 1998 as exports slowed in response to the higher exchange rate and weaker world growth.  In recent quarters the negative contribution from net trade has moderated and strong final domestic demand has been met partly by a sharp rundown in inventories.  Inventories now appear to be closer to desired levels.  The gap between final domestic demand growth and that of GDP should consequently narrow in future quarters. Consumption Consumers’ expenditure has risen rapidly since 1998 Q3, with quarterly growth above 1% in each of the past three quarters.  The pick-up has been faster than the MPC expected at the time of the August Report and the annual growth rate reached 4% in 1999 Q2 (see Chart 2.7). Although consumption growth was again fairly broadly based (see Chart 2.8), part of this strength was accounted for by an erratic factor.  The seasonal pattern of vehicles spending has been affected by the change of registration date for new car sales from once a year in August, to twice a year in March and September.  That is likely  to have boosted spending growth by around  1/4–1/2 percentage point in 1999 Q1.  It is likely to have had less of an effect in Q2, but it may reduce consumption growth in Q3.  In total between January and September, a comparison which should be less affected by the change of registration date, total car registrations were 1.3% lower than in the same period in 1998.  Evidence from monthly indicators points to continued growth of consumption in the second half of the year. Retail sales volume growth has increased markedly since the beginning of 1999, with quarterly growth rates rising to just above 1% a quarter.  Volume growth has risen for most categories of retail sales since the start of the year (see Chart 2.9).  Sales by food stores have risen but volume growth remains low compared with the past  and that may have been one factor, alongside competitive developments, prompting sharper price discounting.   (a) The data for 1999 are for 1999 Q2 compared with a year earlier. (b) The contributions from net trade and inventories may not add up to  the difference between GDP growth and final domestic demand where  a ‘statistical discrepancy’ has been included in the National Accounts.   This affects the data prior to 1985 and in 1998, 1999 (as the accounts  for 1998 and 1999 have yet to be balanced).

And the improvement in confidence since the start of the year is likely to have boosted expenditure.  The outlook for consumption remains robust given the prospects for income and wealth.  Real earnings growth, on a number of different measures, increased through 1998 and has remained high in 1999.  Unemployment has continued to fall (see Section 3).  Housing wealth has continued to pick up, and consumer borrowing—including mortgage equity withdrawal—has risen.  Financial wealth has risen very strongly in recent years, though equity prices have fallen since July and are at around the same levels as at the time of the August Report. Changes in expectations about future income, which may be reflected in measures of consumer confidence, are likely to have affected the profile of consumption over the past year and a half.  Since August, overall consumer confidence measured by the GfK survey has remained positive, and well above its long-run average. Chart 2.10 shows the contrast between household expectations of their own financial situation and expectations about the general economic situation.  The latter has a noticeably greater amplitude.  Survey respondents report bigger swings in confidence about the general economic outlook, in reaction to economic events and the reporting of events, than in expectations about their own circumstances.  Confidence about the general economic situation over the next year has fallen back a little in recent months, whereas confidence about households’ own circumstances has remained steady. Consistent with strong income expectations, employment prospects over the next twelve months have improved, according to the GfK and the new Consumers’ Association surveys. Although the sharp rise in financial wealth in recent years has supported higher consumer spending, housing wealth is likely to have provided an additional impetus to spending this year, as noted in the August Report. House prices, housing wealth and consumers’ expenditure are linked in a number of different ways. Chart 2.11 shows that changes in housing wealth and confidence tend to be closely related.  Rising house prices and housing wealth might therefore be echoed in other signs of consumer confidence.  Spending could also be boosted if homeowners are able to use their house as collateral against borrowing;  that is reflected by mortgage equity withdrawal—which is discussed in the box on page 6.

Spending on durables rose by 10.3% in the year to 1999 Q2, though that was boosted in part by vehicles spending. The MPC has assumed that consumers’ expenditure growth will generally be higher over the forecast horizon than expected at the time of the August Report, given stronger labour income growth and higher housing wealth.  But growth may slow temporarily in 1999 Q3, as the erratic effect of vehicles spending unwinds. Against the background of a generally stronger central projection for consumption, the risks are judged to be balanced. Investment demand Whole-economy investment rose by 0.3% in 1999 Q2 and was 6.8% higher than a year earlier.  Though the ratio of investment to GDP remained at historically high levels (see Chart 2.12), overall investment growth slowed in the first half of 1999 from the fast rates of growth in the previous two years.  Business investment was 11.5% higher than a year earlier in 1999 Q2, but growth slowed to less than 1% per quarter in the first half of 1999, following increases of more than 3% a quarter in the previous two years.  Investment in the energy and utility sectors and the distribution services sector weakened in the latest quarter, but investment in the ‘other services’ sector, which includes business and financial services, continued to grow rapidly.  General government investment fell in Q2. Investment takes place as firms’ adjust from their current levels of capital stock towards desired levels.  The desired capital stock cannot be observed but it, and therefore investment, are influenced by a number of factors.  These include current profits, future expectations of output and profits, capacity constraints, changes in technology and the real cost of capital.  The rapid growth of investment over the past two years is likely to have narrowed the gap between the current and desired capital stock.  That might tend to lead to slower investment growth over future quarters.  But since the August Report, other factors may have raised investment intentions relative to earlier plans. The current level of profits will affect investment to the extent that companies are credit-constrained.  Total company profits in 1999 Q2 were 8.9% lower than a year earlier.  However, expectations about future profitability (a)  At constant prices.  Inflation Report:  November 1999 18 have recovered since the end of 1998 for both the manufacturing and service sectors, and both are close  to their long-run averages (see Chart 2.13).   Higher-than-expected demand would also be expected to raise investment intentions somewhat, relative to earlier plans. The survey evidence on future investment intentions point to overall growth in investment, but at a slower rate than over the past year.  Service sector investment has recently accounted for over two thirds of total business investment.  The BCC survey of investment intentions for the service sector indicated continued growth in investment, but at a slower rate than in 1998 (see Chart 2.14).  Survey measures of investment intentions for the manufacturing sector have been mixed. The BCC manufacturing survey pointed to an increase in investment intentions in the latest quarter, but the CBI survey reported a larger fall in investment intentions than in the previous quarter.  Government fixed investment (general government plus NHS trusts) accounts for around one tenth of total investment.  Real government investment fell in the first half of the year but was some 8% higher than a year earlier in 1999 Q2.  The Government’s stated nominal investment plans are to raise net public sector investment—that is gross investment less depreciation— as a ratio of GDP from 0.6% in the current financial year to 1% by financial year 2001–02.  On average over the latest four quarters, net investment of the public sector was just under 0.6% of GDP at current prices.  Though volatile from quarter to quarter, net public sector investment has been broadly in line with the Government’s announced plans. Bringing this evidence together, the MPC has assumed that whole-economy investment rises further as a proportion of GDP, though prospective growth is slower than in 1998. The financial position of the private sector will also affect future consumption and investment.  If households run into financial difficulties they may cut back on spending.  Similarly, firms in financial difficulty may cut back on investment.  Final domestic demand has strengthened relative to the income of households and companies.  That has resulted in a financial deficit for the private sector as a whole, as borrowing has exceeded savings since mid 1998.  The household sector savings ratio has remained relatively low since 1998 and company profits have weakened.

Demand and output 19 surplus and an inflow of foreign savings to finance the current account deficit have made up for lower private sector savings (see Chart 2.15).  In 1999 Q2 the financial deficit of the private sector rose to 3.5% of GDP, the largest deficit since 1990.  That was the result of a large deficit for the private non-financial corporations sector (PNFCs).  However, this was exaggerated in Q2 by the sharp increase in dividend payments that had been deferred from the previous two quarters, ahead of the abolition of Advance Corporation Tax.  While the private sector has moved into a substantial financial deficit and debt/income ratios have risen, other indicators of financial performance have improved.  The household sector debt/wealth ratio has declined since 1993.  PNFCs’ debt/capital stock ratio (measured at market value) has also fallen back.  Inventory investment Whole-economy inventories fell by £1.2 billion in  1999 Q2 and detracted almost 0.7 percentage points per quarter from annual GDP growth in the first half of the year.(1) The whole-economy inventories to output ratio has been broadly flat since 1995, but it fell in the first half of the year (see Chart 2.16).  There is some evidence from the CBI industrial trends survey that inventories rose to higher-than-desired levels in 1998 and that they have been cut back since then (see Chart 2.17), perhaps aided by discounting and the strengthening of demand. Furthermore, while manufacturing firms expected to continue to reduce inventories in the next four months, they expected to do so at a slower rate than in the previous four months.  In the retailing and wholesale sector, inventories relative to sales were a little above their long-run averages.  The MPC has assumed that there has been a temporary correction to inventories, which has brought stocks more in line with desired levels.  In the next few quarters inventories are likely to be run down at a slower pace and so make small positive contributions to GDP growth.  And in the long run, the ratio of inventories to output is expected to decline. Public sector demand Nominal public sector net borrowing amounted to  £2.6 billion between April and September 1999.  Thus far in the current financial year, net borrowing has been £3.9 billion lower than the same period in 1998, and has Chart 2.15 Net financial position of the private sector,  public sector and current account(a) 10 8 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 1987 89 91 93 95 97 99 Private sector  Per cent of GDP Public sector Current account + _ Chart 2.16 Ratio of whole economy inventories to  Gross Value-Added (GVA)(a) 76 78 80 82 84 86 88 1990 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 Per cent of GVA 0 Chart 2.17 Inventories in the manufacturing sector(a) 0 Percentage point balance 5 10 15 20 25 30 Long-run average 1995 96 97 98 99 Feb. 1985–99 (a) The private sector includes households, non-profit making institutions  serving households, PNFCs and financial companies.

Inflation Report:  November 1999 20 run well below the expectations of independent forecasts formed at the time of the Budget.  Most forecasters have revised down their projections for net borrowing and, on average, now project a surplus for 1999–2000, as  Chart 2.18 shows.  Revenues have been particularly buoyant, largely because economic growth has been higher than expected.  Employment has risen, and unemployment has continued to fall rather than rise, as projected by the independent forecasters earlier in the year.(1) As a result, income tax and corporate tax receipts have increased, and VAT receipts have risen above earlier expectations, as a result of stronger consumers’ expenditure.  Nominal government consumption grew by 3% in the year to 1999 Q2.  The Government’s current spending plans are for an increase in spending on goods and services of 5.3% in this financial year.  The growth rate of real government consumption is therefore likely  to rise over the remainder of the financial year.  The MPC has also assumed that any shortfall of government spending, relative to plans in this financial year, will  be made up gradually over the following two years,  as provided for in the Comprehensive Spending  Review. 2.3 Output According to the preliminary estimate, GDP grew by 0.9% in 1999 Q3.  The annual growth rate rose to 1.8% (see Chart 2.19), somewhat higher than the MPC’s central projection at the time of the August Report. Growth in the service sector has remained robust over the past year.  Manufacturing output has increased in the latest two quarters, following its earlier falls, and grew at a similar rate to service sector output in Q3 (see  Chart 2.20).  Construction output was just 0.7% higher than a year earlier in 1999 Q2.  Relatively low annual growth in the construction sector as a whole contrasts with the more buoyant outlook for the residential housing market.  The box on pages 21and 22 discusses developments in the construction sector. Service sector output rose by 1% in 1999 Q3 and the annual growth rate remained at 2.6%.  Survey data for the service sector as a whole point to continued growth over the period ahead.

Demand and output 21 The UK construction industry Output The construction sector in the United Kingdom employs 1.8 million people—around 6% of the labour force—and accounts for some 5% of GDP.  In the past, construction output growth has been sensitive to the cycles in private and public sector investment.  The long lead times between the start and completion of construction projects, and the large sunk costs of investment, can result in sharp and delayed changes in output in response to changes in demand.  For example, in the late 1980s there was a large build-up in the stock of commercial and industrial property.  But the fall in demand in the early 1990s led to increased spare capacity and a fall in construction output.  Special factors, such as spending on Millennium-related projects, may also influence the level and timing of construction activity. Given these factors, and the relative sensitivity of construction to changes in interest rates,(1) the growth of construction output has been more volatile than GDP as a whole (see Chart A). Construction output was weak through most of 1998, with activity falling by 1.3% between the end of 1997 and the end of 1998.  As the table shows, the decline partly reflected a lower volume of maintenance and repair work, which accounts for around half of construction output.   It was also a result of less new housebuilding. Commercial and industrial construction-related investment grew strongly and contributed to the strength of whole-economy investment.  Construction output has begun to recover in 1999, with output rising by around 0.5% each quarter in the first half of the year.  Investment in construction-related assets picked up, and the decline in repairs and maintenance was less sharp.  But total new orders have continued to fall sharply, as shown on Chart B.  Commercial and industrial orders are substantially lower than a year earlier, though housing orders and starts have picked up. Surveys and other forward-looking indicators Evidence from the surveys and other forward-looking indicators suggests a more buoyant picture (see Chart C), contrasting sharply with the latest data on new orders. The CIPS survey measure of total construction activity has been signalling relatively robust expansion in recent months and buoyant business optimism.  The Construction Confederation survey also pointed to  Construction accounts for around 5% of UK GDP but nearly half of whole-economy investment is construction-related. The sector is sensitive to general trends and cycles in total investment in the private and public sectors.  Construction output fell in 1998 but picked up a little in the first half of 1999.  Though new orders have fallen, other forward-looking survey indicators point to a firming of activity over future quarters.

Inflation Report:  November 1999 22 service sector, as measured by the BCC, has improved markedly since the end of 1998.  The CIPS survey of the service sector pointed to growth in activity, though at a slower rate than earlier in the year.  In the three months to October the business activity index averaged 56.7, well above the neutral level of 50, but just below its average since July 1996 when the survey began. Incoming new business, measured by the CIPS survey, was a little lower in the latest three months and business expectations for the year ahead eased back in October. Manufacturing sector output rose by 0.2% in Q2 and  by 1.0% in Q3 following three quarters of falling  output.  The manufacturing surveys indicate rising activity over coming months.  In 1999 Q3, the BCC survey reported higher domestic sales and orders and it also pointed to an improvement in export activity.  The October CBI survey pointed to a pick-up in total output and orders over the next four months.  Business optimism continued to recover and recorded a positive balance of 13, the highest since early 1995.  The CIPS survey has indicated rising activity each month since May.   higher output.  Demand for new houses has picked up following the increase in house prices with the House Builders’ Federation survey reporting that the balance of firms have recorded higher numbers of site visitors and net reservations since the middle of the year.  Other indicators also point to strengthening investment.  For example, commercial property returns appear to have picked up recently (see Section 1). There are also indications that some capacity constraints are being reached.  The labour market for skilled construction workers has tightened since the beginning  of the year, as a result of higher activity.  Companies  have reported shortages of a number of types of skilled labour, such as bricklayers, carpenters, electricians and plasterers.  The CIPS and the Construction Confederation Surveys also report increasing cost pressures.  Although the cost of construction materials has been subdued  over the past two and a half years, tender price expectations have begun to pick up as unit labour costs have increased.  There are significant differences in capacity constraints across regions.  While nearly all building companies in London report working at or near capacity, only 12% in Yorkshire do so.  The Bank’s regional Agents also report regional disparity in construction activity, with activity stronger in London and the South East.   The outlook for the construction sector is clouded by the mixed signals from the orders and survey data. Nevertheless, the buoyancy of the housing market and the general strength of demand should support construction output over future quarters.  Non-cyclical factors, such as the continuation of Millennium projects, Government plans to raise public sector investment as a proportion of GDP, and Government regeneration programmes that will boost repairs and maintenance, may also help to underpin activity.  Construction Forecasting and Research also project moderate growth in construction output in 2000 and 2001.

Demand and output 23 2.4 Summary GDP growth has strengthened more quickly than expected earlier in the year, and growth in 1999 Q3 was higher than expected at the time of the August Report. Final domestic demand has remained robust, as consumption has continued to grow at a fast pace.  In the first half of the year domestic demand was dampened as firms reduced inventory levels.  Looking ahead, the MPC has assumed that consumption continues to grow at a faster pace than expected at the time of the August Report.  Domestic demand growth is projected to strengthen over the next year, as the rundown in inventories slows. The prospects for world activity and trade have continued to improve since August.  The MPC has assumed that this will help to sustain further growth of UK exports, though the impact is expected to be partly offset by the effect of sterling’s higher exchange rate. The MPC’s central projection is for GDP growth to rise more quickly than expected at the time of the August Report in the near term, reaching an annual rate of 21/2%–3% around the turn of the year, and then levelling off at that rate.  24 3 The labour market Chart 3.1 Headline growth in nominal earnings(a) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1995 96 97 98 99 Percentage changes on a year earlier Manufacturing Services Whole   economy (a) Annual growth in backward-looking three-month average of the AEI. Labour market conditions have tightened since the August Report.  Unemployment, already close to 20-year lows, has fallen further.  Employment growth has picked up, and surveys of employment intentions rebounded strongly in Q3.  Recruitment difficulties and skills shortages persist.  Headline nominal earnings growth rose to 4.9% in August, according to the Average Earnings Index, although nominal pay settlements remain subdued.  Most measures of real earnings growth have picked up over the past year.  3.1 Earnings Nominal earnings growth, as measured by the official Average Earnings Index (AEI), has been stronger than expected at the time of the August Report.  The AEI headline rate of annual earnings growth rose to 4.9% in August, 0.6 percentage points higher than its value a quarter earlier (see Chart 3.1).  Some of this pick-up may reflect noise in the series, which has been volatile this year.  But the headline rate in August was also  0.3 percentage points higher than the average annual rate since the start of the year, consistent with the possibility that underlying earnings growth may have edged upwards.  Private sector indicators, based on much smaller samples, point in diverse directions.  Data from the Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services (FRES) suggest that growth in average salaries for permanent and temporary/contract staff has picked up in recent months.  But the Reward Index of annual earnings growth remains much lower than growth in the AEI. The pick-up in whole-economy earnings growth largely reflects stronger growth in service sector pay, which, as Chart 3.2 shows, accounts for three quarters of the aggregate index.  The headline measure of service sector earnings growth rose to 5.4% in August, 0.6 percentage points above the average annual growth rate during this year, and 0.5 percentage points below the peak in June last year.  All of the latest rise in service sector pay growth reflected stronger growth in the private sector; the headline measure of public sector earnings growth fell between June and August.  Earnings growth in manufacturing has been lower than that in the economy as a whole since the start of last year, reflecting the much Chart 3.2 Composition of Average Earnings Index(a) Private services 56% Public services 20% Manufacturing 18% Other 5% (a) Shares do not sum because of rounding.  The labour market 25 The new sample for the Average Earnings Index (AEI) From October, the ONS has begun using an improved sample of firms to calculate the AEI.  The official review of the index published earlier this year(1) found that the existing sample—largely drawn up in the late 1980s—had become unrepresentative.  A comparatively large share of the index—which is weighted to reflect the structure of the economy as a whole—was based on returns from a comparatively small share of the sample, causing volatility in the series.  Some interim remedies to this problem were adopted in the index that was reinstated in March this year.  But, as the chart shows, AEI outturns remained volatile, complicating the task of drawing inferences about trends in earnings growth. In choosing the new sample, a key aim was to reduce the variance of annual growth in the AEI.  The  total sample size has been increased, from 8,037 to 8,285 firms.  And a substantially higher share of the sample has been drawn from the service sector, bringing the sectoral distribution of firms much more closely into line with that in the whole economy  (see the table).  The ‘grossing factors’ and employment weights used to translate the sample responses into  an estimate of whole-economy earnings have also  been updated, and are now based on the ONS  Inter-Departmental Business Register as of June 1999. Special adjustments introduced to tackle particular problems with the old sample in the education,  health and financial intermediation sectors have  been removed.  ONS calculations show that the standard error of monthly AEI growth rates based on the new sample—a measure of the spread of estimates across firms, and the precision of the aggregate estimate—is substantially lower than that under the old sample. The introduction of the new sample has not caused a discontinuity in the level of the AEI between July and August, the first month to reflect information from the new sample.  Each month’s AEI is calculated by applying a one-month growth rate to the previous month’s index.  The one-month growth rates are calculated using returns from a ‘matched sample’ of employers reporting in both months.  So growth between June and July was calculated using a matched sample based entirely on firms in the old sample reporting in both June and July.  And growth between July and August was calculated using a matched sample based entirely on firms in the new sample reporting in both July and August.  Though the old  and new samples will not give identical estimates of one-month growth rates, part of the acceptance process for the new sample required the ONS to provide satisfactory explanations of significant differences in the historical series.  It will, however, be a year before the published annual AEI growth rates are based entirely upon data from the new sample. To reduce the likelihood of the sample again becoming out of date, the ONS will regularly refresh the set of reporting firms.  All firms with more than 1,000 employees remain in the sample indefinitely.  But, over the course of each year, 20% of smaller firms will be replaced.  Grossing factors and employment weights will also be updated annually.  And the ONS will keep the statistical performance of the index under review. Updating the sample meets a key requirement of the Turnbull-King review, and, over time, should help to improve the quality of the annual earnings growth statistics.  The ONS is continuing to work on other recommendations from the review, and is due to make a progress report to the Economic Secretary to the Treasury by the end of this year.

The findings of the review are summarised in the box on page 24 of the May Inflation Report.  Inflation Report:  November 1999 26 weaker path of activity in that sector.  But there have also been signs of a slight pick-up in manufacturing pay growth in recent months (see Chart 3.1). One component of overall pay is the annual  wage settlement.  The Bank’s twelve-month employment-weighted measure of whole-economy settlements has continued to edge down, reaching 3.5% in September, compared with 3.6% at the time of the August Report.  Shorter-term measures have also been relatively stable, albeit at a slightly lower level:  the Bank’s three-month average measure has been at or around 3.2% since the late spring. Aggregate earnings growth as measured by the AEI  has been substantially stronger than settlements over the past year.  Part of this probably reflects the continuing structural trend away from reliance on broad  company-wide settlements and towards the use of bonuses, merit pay, overtime and other remuneration methods which allow greater flexibility with respect to individual performance and demand conditions.  As Chart 3.3 shows, the gap between earnings and settlements—known as ‘wage drift’—has been almost continuously positive in recent years, consistent with settlements accounting for a declining share of the overall pay bill. The path of wage drift through the year is also influenced by adjustments made by employers to their wage bills in response to changes in demand, profits and labour market conditions.  Wage drift has been rather stronger over the past year than might have been expected given the path of activity alone.  As Chart 3.4 shows, wage drift has tended to move in line with growth in overtime pay—the component of earnings most directly influenced by changes in demand conditions.  But while overtime pay as measured by the New Earnings Survey fell in the year to April 1999, wage drift remained reasonably firm, at around its  long-run average.  More recently, there have been signs that overtime pay may have picked up again, consistent with the recovery in activity. One way of assessing the impact of profitability and labour market conditions on wage drift is to examine the behaviour of bonuses, which are paid both to reward staff for past productivity and profitability gains, and to maintain and improve staff retention.  Following a change in the AEI questionnaire earlier this year, official data on annual bonus growth are currently an unreliable Chart 3.3 Settlements, nominal earnings growth and  wage drift 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1985 88 91 94 97 Per cent Settlements (b) Annual growth in   nominal earnings (a)  Wage drift (c) Average wage drift 1985–99 + – Sources: ONS, Bank of England, and Industrial Relations Services (IRS).

However, the ONS has produced an alternative estimate of annual bonus growth, using data only from those employers who paid bonuses both this year and last, which should be less affected by the reporting discontinuity.  These calculations suggest that bonuses in the first seven months of this year were some 8% higher at the whole-economy level than in the same period last year, as larger bonuses in the service sector more than offset lower payments in manufacturing (see Table 3.A).  The uncertainties around this estimate are considerable.  But, as with other components of wage drift, any growth in aggregate bonuses seems more likely to reflect the persistent tightness of labour market conditions, and the continuing structural trend towards more flexible pay, rather than recent profit growth, which has been subdued at the aggregate level (see Section 2).  Recent earnings growth will also have been influenced by the introduction of the National Minimum Wage (NMW) from 1 April.  In previous Reports, the MPC assumed that the NMW would add around half a percentage point to its central projection for annual earnings growth in Q2 and Q3, and somewhat smaller contributions in subsequent quarters over the forecast period.(2) Although it is still too early to make a full assessment of the overall effect on earnings growth, it seems likely that the initial impact has been smaller than previously expected.  The MPC will continue to assess the situation in the light of further information.  But, on the basis of currently available data, the Committee has decided to lower its estimate of the impact of the NMW on earnings growth by a third. Although wages are typically agreed in nominal terms, wage-bargainers care about the real value of earnings— workers because it determines their ability to purchase goods and services, and firms because it determines the real cost of labour.  While nominal earnings growth has fallen compared with a year ago, many measures of current and expected inflation have fallen by more (see Table 3.B and Section 4 of this Report).  So most (1) Before February, employers were asked to report bonuses only when there had been a significant change in monthly pay.  Since then, they have been asked to report all bonuses paid.  This change affects the split of total pay between reported regular and bonus components, but has no impact on the overall value of the AEI. (2) Details of the MPC’s previous assumptions are given in the box on page 30 of the August 1998 Report, and the text on pages 25–26 of the August 1999 Report.

(a) Figures refer to RPI inflation, except for General public, for which the measure  of inflation is not specified.  Inflation Report:  November 1999 28 measures of growth in real earnings and labour costs have risen over the past year (see Chart 3.5). Rising real wage growth is consistent with tightening labour market conditions.  When the demand for labour rises relative to its supply, workers are generally able to negotiate larger increases in expected real earnings during wage negotiations.  As Chart 3.5 shows, the real expected value of wage settlements over the coming year continued to rise during this year’s round, despite the substantial fall in their nominal value.  But the real value of wages actually received by workers depends on the realised level of inflation.  Inflation outturns have been lower than expected a year earlier, on both the RPIX and RPI measures (see Chart 3.6).  So some of the rise in realised real earnings growth over the past year may have reflected a fall in inflation relative to that expected at the time the wages were initially agreed, rather than the direct impact of labour market tightness. 3.2 Employment and unemployment There have been signs of a renewed pick-up in labour demand.  According to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), total hours worked rose by 0.4% in the three months to August, having been broadly flat since last summer.  As Chart 3.7 shows, the increase in total hours largely reflected a rise in employment growth.  Average hours worked rose only slightly.  It is possible that firms may have had less scope to raise the hours worked by existing employees in response to the pick-up in demand than previously assumed.  This might reflect a range of factors, including a smaller build-up of spare capacity within firms last year than previously thought, or the impact of the Working Time Directive.  The implications for the inflation projection are discussed in Section 6. Employment growth in recent quarters has reflected the strength of recruitment in the service sector:  in the year to 1999 Q2, the number of service sector jobs rose by 454,000, or 2.2%, according to the Workforce Jobs survey.  The number of manufacturing jobs fell by 183,000, or 4.1%, over the same period.  But there are signs that the rate of decline may now be slowing:  the fall in manufacturing employment in 1999 Q2 was roughly half that in each of the previous two quarters. More timely or forward-looking indicators of employment growth have also picked up since the August Report.

October, above the no-change value of 50, but still well below its levels in 1997–98 (see Chart 3.8).  Business surveys of employment intentions rose quite sharply in Q3:  all of the series shown in Table 3.C are consistent with above-average employment growth in the coming months.  The Private Sector Job Advertising Index increased by 14% between April and September, and the number of vacancies at Jobcentres rose by some 7%, after adjustment for various reporting errors affecting the series.   The average length of time taken to fill vacancies has risen considerably compared with the previous cycle  (see Chart 3.9).  Vacancy duration is affected both by  the degree of slack in the labour market, and by the efficiency with which workers are matched to jobs. While some factors, such as structural changes in the skills demanded by employers, may have caused some temporary fall in matching efficiency over the past  ten years, other innovations, such as the growth in the number of recruitment agencies and the greater use of information technology to match workers to jobs,  are likely to have worked in the opposite direction. Overall, therefore, higher vacancy duration probably reflects the relative tightness of labour market conditions.  Pay pressures are influenced by the balance between the demand for, and the supply of, labour.  Net labour supply is most readily drawn from those who are already searching for, and available for, work.  The LFS unemployment rate—a measure of the size of this group—has fallen from 6.2% at the time of the previous Report to 5.9% in the three months to August, the lowest since the series began in 1984.  The claimant count rate—an alternative measure of unemployment based on the number of people receiving benefits—also fell, reaching 4.2% in September, the lowest since March 1980 (see Chart 3.10).  Unemployment outturns have continued to be lower than expected earlier in the year, and most external forecasters—who had been anticipating a substantial rise in unemployment—now expect unemployment to be broadly flat in the coming months. Although unemployment is lower than during the 1980s, the rate of unemployment consistent with steady inflation has also fallen, reflecting the impact of  labour market reforms and structural changes in the economy over the past two decades.

Inflation Report:  November 1999 30 has been somewhat weaker during the 1990s recovery than at a similar point during the previous cycle (see Chart 3.11). One factor that may have reduced the equilibrium unemployment rate is the decline in the number of young people entering the labour force, following the end of the ‘baby boom’ in the mid 1970s.  Between 1984 and 1999, the 16–24 year old age group fell from 19% to 14% of the over-16 population, and from 23% to 15% of the active labour force, according to the LFS.  The young have above-average rates of unemployment (see  Chart 3.12), reflecting the fact that they tend to make more frequent movements into and out of unemployment than older workers.  Several inter-related factors could account for this higher turnover.  First, those entering employment for the first time may try several jobs before they discover the one best suited to their skills.  Second, the young may be more likely to work in sectors characterised by relatively high turnover rates.  And third, in as much as younger workers are less likely to have accumulated on-the-job experience and skills than older employees, they may be more likely to be laid off by firms facing a decline in demand.  To the extent that the ageing of the workforce has put downward pressure on overall labour market turnover, it may also have lowered the equilibrium unemployment rate.  One  way of calibrating the possible importance of this effect is to compare the actual aggregate unemployment rate with a hypothetical value calculated using actual unemployment rates for each age group, but holding the age composition of the workforce constant at its level in some base year.  Bank work based on calculations of this kind suggests that demographic change might account for about half a percentage point of the decline in the LFS unemployment rate over the past fifteen years, and a little over half of the fall since the previous trough in 1990.(1) Business surveys suggest that firms have continued to face difficulties in recruiting appropriately qualified staff, although labour shortages differ considerably by sector and skill type.  The CBI measure of unskilled labour shortages in manufacturing and the BCC measures of general recruitment difficulties are both well above their longer-run averages;  but the CBI measure of skill shortages in manufacturing remains relatively weak (see Chart 3.13).  The Bank’s regional Agents report that (1) These results are broadly similar to figures estimated on US data.

Consistent with these reports, the FRES survey has been reporting reduced availability of permanent and temporary staff since June, with particular shortages in IT and business services.  Most employers facing skill shortages do not consider them to be temporary, according to a survey carried out by the Bank’s regional Agents for the November pre-MPC meeting.  Some contacts with recruitment difficulties intended to address their problems by increasing their own training efforts, constraining output growth, or cutting back on other costs.  But 80% of those reporting shortages expected to have to raise pay rates to attract and retain appropriate staff. The fall in LFS unemployment in the three months to August was associated with a small rise in inactivity. The inactive are those who are neither in employment, nor actively searching for, and available for, work. Broadly speaking, inactivity might be expected to follow a cyclical pattern, with higher demand growth reducing unemployment, increasing the probability of finding a job, and so causing some of the inactive to start searching for work;  and lower demand growth having the reverse effect.  Consistent with this, inactivity followed a similar path to unemployment during the 1980s and the early 1990s (see Chart 3.14).  But the link between the two series has been much weaker in recent years.  While unemployment has fallen substantially since 1993, the inactivity rate has remained broadly unchanged.  The failure of inactivity to fall during the 1990s is largely accounted for by increases in the number of students, the early retired and the long-term sick.  To the extent that these movements reflect structural changes, they might not be expected to be rapidly reversed.  As Chart 3.15 shows, if these components are excluded, inactivity is at its lowest level since the series started in 1984.  Over time, inactivity may be reduced further by Government initiatives designed to improve the incentives for the inactive to  re-enter work, such as the Working Families Tax Credit, which came into operation in October. 3.3 Summary Although nominal wage settlements have remained subdued, growth in total earnings—measured in either nominal or real terms—has been higher than expected at the time of the August Report.

Part of the pick-up in real earnings growth may have reflected unexpectedly low inflation outturns.  But higher earnings growth may also signal a tightening in labour market conditions, as activity has recovered unexpectedly rapidly.  Growth in both current and anticipated employment—as indicated by business surveys—has picked up, and the number of job vacancies has risen.  Unemployment, already close to 20-year lows, has fallen further.  Labour market inactivity remains higher than during the previous cycle, but much of this appears to reflect structural factors. Business surveys suggest that firms have been facing difficulties in recruiting appropriately qualified staff, although recent trends differ somewhat by sector and skill type.  The implications of these developments for the Committee’s judgments on the outlook for earnings growth and inflation are discussed in Section 6 of this Report.  33 Costs and prices 4 Chart 4.1 Real oil prices 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 1986 88 90 92 94 96 98 Jan. 1986 = 100 Sterling price (a) US dollar price (b) (a) Sterling price of Brent crude oil one-month forward, deflated by RPIX. (b) US dollar price of Brent crude oil one-month forward, deflated by OECD consumer prices. RPIX inflation has remained below the government’s 21/2% target since the August Report.  The continued subdued growth of retail prices has reflected low inflation in a broad range of goods prices.  That has been partly because of the lagged effects of past declines in import prices, but may also be the result of downward pressure on price-cost mark-ups in a number of sectors, owing to strengthening competition.  However, the international price outlook has become less benign. Sterling import prices are no longer falling sharply and forecasts for world activity have been revised up modestly.  Overall, world prices for commodities— particularly oil—have risen further, although agricultural commodity prices remain depressed. 4.1 Raw materials and commodity prices World prices for crude oil have risen further since the August Report.  The average of the one-month forward price of Brent crude oil was over $21 per barrel in the four months to October, more than $7 higher than in the first half of the year.  The buoyancy of world oil prices has continued to be strongly influenced by supply restraints.  In particular, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed in September to retain its existing oil production restrictions until  March 2000.  Oil prices have also been supported by the outlook for global economic activity.  The International Energy Agency projects a rise in world oil demand of 1.5% in 1999 and 2.4% in 2000, compared with growth of 0.6% in 1998.   Despite the recent rise in nominal oil prices, the real oil price—relative to price indices such as RPIX—has declined over the past two decades, even excluding the period of sharply falling prices in the mid 1980s which followed the world oil shocks in 1974 and 1979 (see Chart 4.1).  Various factors influence the long-term trend in oil prices.  As with other commodities that have a limited global supply, continued extraction of oil tends to increase the scarcity of the resource, and the marginal cost of extraction might also be inclined to increase over time.  This would be likely to raise the relative price of oil in the longer term.  However, that effect may have been weakened by upward revisions to estimates of the  Inflation Report:  November 1999 34 Chart 4.4 Sectoral equity prices(a) 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Jan. 1998 = 100 Oil  Metal mining Foods 1998 99 110 (a) Standard and Poor’s sectoral equity price indices relative to the  Standard and Poor’s 500 Composite index, both denominated in  US dollars. world’s available oil reserves in recent years, as improvements in exploration technology have reduced the cost of finding additional reserves.  Changes in production technology may have further dampened real oil prices, as general improvements in energy efficiency and shifts towards oil substitutes have curbed the consumption of oil by developed industrial economies in recent decades.   Around any long-term trend in the oil price, however, there is significant volatility, owing partly to the fact that oil is traded as an asset as well as a physical resource. Reflecting the marked increase in nominal oil prices since the August Report and the effect of slightly stronger projections of world demand growth over the next two years, the MPC has revised up its assumptions of the outlook for the nominal oil price over the forecast period.  However, the oil price is still assumed to fall back from present levels, to around $18 per barrel over the next two years.   Moderate growth overall in the prices of non-oil commodities has continued.  In the three months to September, the Bank’s index of sterling non-oil commodity prices rose by 1.4% compared with the previous three months, and was on average 0.9% higher than a year earlier (see Chart 4.2).(1) But the divergent trends in soft and hard commodity prices have become more pronounced since the August Report.(2) Strong rises in hard commodity prices have been largely offset by continued declines in prices of soft commodities, especially food (see Chart 4.3).  The relative shifts in hard and soft world commodity prices in 1999 have  been mirrored by movements in US equity prices for those companies most affected by the prices of these different types of commodity (see Chart 4.4).  That might suggest that financial markets anticipate some persistence in the relative price trends, since equity prices partly reflect market expectations of future corporate profits. The recent divergence in hard and soft commodity prices highlights the fact that movements in soft commodity prices are less closely aligned to the global economic (1) The Bank of England’s non-oil commodity price index has been revised since the August Report, reflecting updated weights for its components. The new weights reflect each type of commodity’s share in total UK consumption of commodities in 1995, compared with 1990 in the previous index.  The level of the new index in 1999 is slightly lower than suggested by the old index when both series are rebased to 1995, though the pattern and direction of growth is little changed following the revisions.  The lower level of the new index reflects a higher weight for food and lower weights for fuels and metals. (2) Hard commodities include metals and fuels, whereas soft commodities include food (both UK-produced food and non-indigenous food) and other agricultural products.

Stronger global economic activity in the first half of 1999 might have been expected to raise demand and therefore put upward pressure on prices for all types of commodity.  However, demand for food may be less sensitive to changes in economic activity than demand for industrial commodities such as metals.  And prices of soft commodities—which are largely agricultural products— are more vulnerable to supply-side shocks that are linked to weather conditions.  Moreover, the effects of supply shifts on soft commodity prices are accentuated by the fact that soft commodities tend to be more perishable than hard commodities, and are therefore less amenable to storage.   The continuing weakness of soft commodity prices means that the overall level of non-oil commodity prices in 1999 Q2 was lower than expected at the time of the August Report.  However, reflecting the slightly stronger outlook for world growth, the Committee now assumes in its central projection a stronger rebound in total  non-oil commodity prices from this lower level. 4.2 Import prices and the exchange rate Sterling import prices of goods and services in 1999 Q2 were broadly unchanged compared with the first quarter of the year, and were 2.8% lower than a year earlier. Within the total, services import prices in Q2 were 0.6% higher than a year earlier, while goods import prices were 3.8% lower.  The weakness of goods import prices reflects the past appreciation of sterling, and subdued export prices of the United Kingdom’s major trading partners.  But sterling import prices for goods stabilised in Q2, after declining for almost three years.  The rise in oil prices was a significant factor behind this, as shown by Chart 4.5.  But even excluding oil, the rate of decline in other imported goods prices has eased since the end of 1998.   Though the MPC’s central projection assumes that oil prices rise no further, recent increases in oil prices are nevertheless likely to place additional upward pressure on UK import prices in the coming months, through their effect on world export prices.  Rising energy prices have already been passed through to manufacturing input prices in the United Kingdom’s major trading partners (see Chart 4.6), and this will eventually be reflected in higher producer output prices and export prices in these countries.  Somewhat improved prospects for world demand growth since the August Report have also Chart 4.5 Contribution to quarterly change of  sterling goods import prices 1995 96 97 98 99 Manufactured goods Fuels (a) Basic materials Food, drink and tobacco Goods import prices Percentage points 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 + – Chart 4.6 Survey measures of international  manufacturing input prices 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 1998 99 Index (a) Germany France Italy United States United Kingdom Sources: CIPS (United Kingdom), National Association of Purchasing  Management (United States) and Reuters (Germany, France  and Italy).

Inflation Report:  November 1999 36 The demand for oil has declined over the past two decades in the United Kingdom, in common with most other G7 countries.  That has reflected improvements in the efficiency of oil refining and usage, and the increasing use of non-oil energy sources.  But oil still accounted for around one tenth of the goods used as inputs to manufacturing in 1995, and petroleum products accounted directly for nearly 3% of total household consumption expenditure in 1998.  So changes in oil prices can have a significant effect on domestic costs and prices.  Movements in crude oil prices are closely matched by changes in the cost of inputs to the manufacturing sector. The effect of these changes in crude oil input prices on manufacturers’ output prices for refined petroleum products is slightly less marked.  For example, from the peak in world oil prices in late 1997 to their trough in late 1998, oil input prices fell by more than 50%, while output prices for petroleum products (excluding duties) fell by just under 35%.  The maximum effect on oil output prices also tends to be seen one month after any change in input prices.  These divergences between input and output prices reflect the costs of the non-oil inputs used to add value, and the time taken in producing the more highly processed petroleum products.   Retail prices for petrol are less directly exposed to movements in crude oil prices.  The larger costs of distribution place an additional wedge between the price of oil used in manufacturing and the retail price of petroleum products.  Furthermore, almost the entire share of oil goods in the RPI reflects consumption of road fuel, and around two thirds of the retail price of road fuel is accounted for by government excise duties, with a further proportion accounted for by VAT.  These duties are fixed in each Budget, and—unlike VAT—do not vary with the price of oil itself.  Instead, road fuel duties have been uprated in line with the rate of RPI inflation in September each year, plus an additional escalator which means that the retail price of petrol has risen in real terms, consistent with the government’s environmental objectives.  As a result of the weight of duties in the final retail price for road fuel, the observable effect of rises in crude oil prices is less marked in petrol prices within RPIX than in RPIY, which excludes duties (see chart). However, the impact of a rise in oil prices on both producer and retail price indices is augmented through the use of oil as an energy input in the production of  non-oil goods and services.  Moreover, as higher oil  costs similarly tend to raise the prices of goods and services in other countries, world export prices would also tend to rise following an increase in world oil prices,  all else being equal.  Hence rises in crude oil prices would also affect domestic prices through the import prices channel.  The United Kingdom is a small net exporter of crude oil, and North Sea production (which includes gas as well as oil) accounts for about 2% of UK GDP.  Hence developments in world oil prices also affect UK activity and expenditure.  For example, rising oil prices raise the United Kingdom’s export prices relative to its import prices, all other things equal, generating a positive  terms-of-trade effect on the external balance of the United Kingdom.  The profits of UK oil companies also tend to increase in the quarters following a rise in world oil prices, as the volume of oil sales is fairly insensitive to price changes in the short term.  For instance, profits of companies operating on the UK Continental Shelf rose by 15% in 1999 Q2, reflecting the sharp rise in fuel prices in the first half of 1999.  Oil companies may respond to such increases in prices and profits by increasing their rate of production from existing wells, and by expanding their capacity through additional exploration, higher fixed investment and higher employment.  Rising oil prices also affect government revenues, through various types of tax on UK oil production.  Apart from corporation tax, which is payable on the profits of all companies, the government also collects petroleum revenue tax and royalties from the older oil fields.  Taxes on North Sea production accounted for just under 1% of total government receipts in 1998–99.(1) So although a substantial rise in oil prices would tend to generate global inflationary pressures and thus impose adjustment costs on the UK and the world economy, such a rise in prices could have smaller aggregate effects on activity in the United Kingdom than in non-oil exporting countries.

(1) Source:  Budget 99, HM Treasury, March 1999, Table B10.  Road fuel duties accounted for a further 6% of government receipts in 1998–99, though revenue from these duties is unaffected by changes in the underlying oil price, as noted above.  Costs and prices 37 strengthened the outlook for world export prices. However, the recent appreciation of sterling has mitigated these influences.  Hence although import prices are still projected to rise steadily throughout the forecast period, the MPC projection for UK import prices is lower than in the August Report. 4.3 Costs and prices in manufacturing and construction Manufacturers’ input prices have risen sharply in recent months.  Annual inflation in input prices became positive in July for the first time in three years, and had reached 5.8% by September.  That reflected pass-through to manufacturers of the rise in crude oil prices—UK producer input prices for oil in 1999 Q3 were more than 70% higher than in the same period a year earlier. Excluding petrol and other volatile components, such as food, drink and tobacco, input prices remain lower than a year earlier.  But they rose slightly in the three months to September (see Chart 4.7), owing to a rise in the costs of imported materials, particularly those of metals and other non-oil commodities.  This general strengthening in producer input prices was consistent with survey data. The input price index in the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) manufacturing survey continued to rise, with respondents attributing higher prices to the recovery in world demand for commodities. The CBI quarterly industrial trends survey suggested that unit costs were still falling in 1999 Q3, but that the rate of decline had slowed further.  Manufacturers’ output prices have continued to edge up in recent months, largely owing to higher prices for petroleum products.  After recording negative inflation rates for nearly two years, producer output prices excluding excise duties were higher in August and September than a year earlier.  Excluding petrol, food, drink and tobacco, output prices were 0.3% lower than a year earlier, but they rose a little during Q3.  Survey data from the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) suggest that this is a trend that is likely to continue, as in  1999 Q3 manufacturers reported expected price rises over the coming quarter.  That was the first expected rise in output prices recorded by the BCC for more than a year, and was reported to reflect upward revisions to firms’ expectations of prices for raw materials.  The CBI quarterly industrial trends survey in Q3 continued to suggest expectations of falling output prices in the coming months, but the balance is now less negative than at any time since 1998 Q2 (see Chart 4.8).

Inflation Report:  November 1999 38 The CIPS report on the construction sector suggested that input prices continued to rise in 1999 Q3.  As well as fuel input prices rising, most other inputs were also reported to have increased in price, reflecting stronger demand for construction supplies.  This is consistent with stronger activity in the sector since the beginning of the year, though the CIPS survey suggests that the rate of expansion has slowed slightly since June.  The box on page 21–22 discussed recent trends in the construction sector in more detail. 4.4 Costs and prices in the service sector Survey evidence suggests that inflationary pressure in the service sector may have strengthened somewhat (see Table 4.A).  In 1999 Q3, the BCC reported a marked increase in the proportion of firms intending to increase their prices in the following quarter.  That reflected rises in a range of costs, including raw materials, labour and finance.  The CIPS service sector survey also reported that firms had faced higher costs in recent months, particularly because of rises in labour costs.  Its measure of prices charged was lower in Q3 than in Q2, and suggested a small net decline over the quarter. Competitive pressures were reported to have reduced the scope for translating higher input prices into higher output prices.  But that was not sustained:  in October, the CIPS survey reported that prices charged in the service sector had edged up in response to rising costs. 4.5 Retail prices The rate of retail price inflation excluding mortgage interest payments (RPIX) has fallen further below the government’s 21/2% target in recent months.  It stood at 2.1% in August and September, compared with 2.2% in June and July (see Chart 4.9).  RPI inflation also slowed further, to 1.1% in August and September, from 1.3% in June and July.  The difference between RPI and RPIX inflation reflects changes in mortgage interest payments (MIPs), which are affected mainly by movements in mortgage interest rates.  Growth in MIPs has slowed since mid 1998, as changes in official interest rates have lowered mortgage interest rates.  However, the gap between RPI and RPIX inflation will tend to narrow in the coming months, as the effects of the earlier declines in mortgage interest rates drop out of the calculation of the RPI inflation rate.  The most recent rises in official interest rates may also work to narrow the gap (see Chart 4.10).

Costs and prices 39 Retail services price inflation rose to 3.6% in September, from 3.3% in June.  The increase was primarily the result of higher prices in three sectors:  foreign holidays, vehicle insurance, and telephone charges.  The lower inflation of RPIX during Q3 therefore reflected movements in goods price inflation, which fell further despite the rise in oil prices this year.(1) The contribution of road fuel to RPIX goods inflation rose from  0.5 percentage points in Q2 to 0.7 percentage points in Q3, but this was more than offset by continued weakness in prices for a broad range of other retail goods.  These included clothing and footwear, leisure goods, some household goods and both seasonal and non-seasonal food (see Chart 4.11).  The lagged effects of past declines in imported goods prices continue to have an impact on RPIX goods prices. But changes in retailers’ pricing behaviour may also have contributed to the recent weakness of goods prices. The Bank’s regional Agents have reported that more than half of their retail contacts were discounting their products more deeply than usual in 1999, particularly in the food, mixed goods retailing, cars, and clothing and footwear sectors.  In some sectors, ONS price data suggest that there has been little deviation from normal seasonal price patterns, particularly those which appear after a period of slower demand growth, such as in  1998 Q4 and 1999 Q1.  But in other sectors such as food and cars, deeper price discounting appears to represent a clearer break with past patterns.  One third of those retailers reporting deeper price discounting to the Bank’s regional Agents attributed the change in pricing behaviour to increased competition, whereas only a small proportion suggested that their lower prices reflected lower input costs.  It is therefore possible that some of the decline in goods price inflation stems from changes in competitive behaviour in certain markets.  Particular developments in competition and regulation have at different times in the past lowered the inflation rate of some products, such as electricity, telephone charges and books.  Those changes had no obvious marked effect on RPIX inflation overall— perhaps because other changes in the prices of other goods and services happened to offset them (see  Chart 4.12).  However, the MPC judges that the current increase in competitive pressures is rather more widespread than has been observed in the past.  The Committee has therefore assumed that there will be (1) The box on page 36 contains more discussion of the links between oil prices and retail prices.

Section 6 discusses the outlook for retail prices in more detail.  Measures of domestically generated inflation (DGI) suggest that domestic inflationary pressures have eased somewhat since the August Report (see Chart 4.13).  The GDP deflator measure of DGI has fallen towards 2%, but the retail price and labour cost measures of DGI remain above the target of 21/2% inflation for RPIX.  4.6 Other price indices Annual growth in the GDP deflator was 1.8% in  1999 Q2, its lowest rate for more than four years. Inflation in the deflator for final consumption expenditure was particularly weak, dropping to its  lowest since the series began in 1955.  The annual rate  of change in the monthly retail sales deflator has been negative since May and fell to -0.5% in September, which suggests that slow growth in the broader consumption deflator may have continued into Q3. Inflation in the retail sales deflator has been markedly weaker than the outturns in RPIX goods price  inflation (see Chart 4.14) in recent years, despite the  fact that RPI goods price data are used in the construction of the deflator.  That has largely reflected differences in weights attached to the components of the two indices, and some divergence in coverage.  For example, the retail sales deflator does not include cars or petrol.  Other measures of retail price inflation have also fallen in recent months.  The trimmed mean measure of inflation declined further in 1999 Q3, to 1.6% from 1.8% in Q2 (see Chart 4.15).  This measure excludes the largest and smallest weighted price changes in the individual components of the retail price index, to create a measure of underlying inflation that as far as possible excludes major shifts in relative prices.(1) Annual inflation in the UK Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) also fell in Q3 and stood at 1.2% in September.  That eliminated the gap between HICP inflation in the United Kingdom and in the euro area, where inflation rose from 0.9% to 1.2% between June and September (see Chart 4.16).

Inflation in the service sector has strengthened, but there has been weakness in a broad range of goods prices.  That has partly reflected the lagged effects of past declines in sterling import prices, but it may also have been the result of some downward pressure on the inflation rate from increased competition in the retail sector.  Signs of stronger producer price pressures in manufacturing largely reflect the recent rises in world oil prices, though the broader international price situation has also become less benign.  Non-oil commodity prices have risen and the outlook for world export prices has strengthened.  Against this, the stronger exchange rate profile will dampen upward pressure on sterling import prices in future quarters.  The balance between these international and domestic influences is key to the overall inflation outlook, as UK economic activity strengthens.

The minutes of the August, September and October meetings are attached as an Annex to this Report.  The Bank of England’s repo rate was increased from 5% to 5.25% in September, was maintained at that level in October, and was increased to 5.5% in November. In the August Report, the MPC’s central projection was for four-quarter GDP growth to pick up to around trend by early 2000, rising to about 3% at the two-year forecast horizon.  The risks around the projection were on the upside in the first year, but on the downside thereafter.  The Committee’s best collective judgment was for RPIX inflation to fall slightly below 2% towards the end of 2000 before rising just above the 21/2% target at the end of the projection, with slight upside risks throughout the forecast period.  But there was considerable uncertainty surrounding the prospects for inflation, and some Committee members preferred to base their central projection on alternative assumptions. In particular, some Committee members preferred an assumption that the exchange rate stays constant, rather than declining on account of interest rate differentials. This lowered their projected profile for inflation.  Some of these Committee members judged that there were further downside risks to inflation from the possibility of lower profit margins or weaker pay pressures, although these might be offset somewhat by greater upside pressure from higher oil prices.  Other Committee members took the view that pay pressures were likely to be stronger than in the best collective projection, which raised their profile for inflation. At its meeting on 7–8 September, the Committee noted the possibility that US growth might be less strong than assumed in the August Report.  There were also signs of incipient inflationary pressures, and the Federal Open Market Committee had recently raised the Federal funds target rate by 0.25 percentage points.  Prospects for the euro area were perhaps a little firmer than had been expected in August.  Other forecasters’ projections for Japanese GDP growth in 1999 had continued to be revised up, and the recovery in the rest of Asia had been stronger than previously expected.  Although the most  Monetary policy since the August Report 43 recent data were not significantly stronger than a month earlier, overall the Committee was more confident about its projection of a robust recovery in world activity. In the United Kingdom, a breakdown of expenditure for the second quarter of 1999 had shown stronger growth in final domestic demand than had been expected at the time of the August Report.  Stronger consumption growth was a major contributing factor, and more timely monthly indicators suggested that this strength in consumption had continued into the third quarter. Recent household money and credit data were also indicative of faster growth in consumer spending. Consumer credit growth had been strong, and estimates of mortgage equity withdrawal were the highest for eight years.  Housing market activity as measured by particulars delivered was greater than at any time since the early 1990s, and there remained a large stock of, as yet unused, mortgage approvals.  House price inflation was around 10% on both the Halifax and Nationwide measures, and appeared to be more widespread—recent rises were not confined to a few isolated hot spots.   The Committee judged that the demand and output indicators were almost universally stronger than a month earlier. The Labour Force Survey measure of the unemployment rate had reached its lowest level since the series began in 1984, while the claimant count rate was at its lowest level since 1980.  The Bank’s regional Agents had also reported signs of tightness returning, even for some lower-skilled occupations.  The Average Earnings Index had picked up markedly in June, although this was influenced by bonuses and the trend was hard to discern. The Reward Index had shown earnings growth continuing to slow and settlements had fallen slightly. But allowing for changes in inflation expectations over the previous year, real earnings growth had probably risen. On costs and prices, the Committee noted that although some input prices were stronger, producer output prices and retail prices remained weak, and RPIX inflation had been below target for four consecutive months.  The oil price was substantially higher than expected at the time of the August Report, and prices of a number of other commodities had also risen, perhaps reflecting stronger world demand.  But the prospect of increasing competition, for example in food retailing, combined with regulatory effects in the water and electricity industries, might work to reduce the aggregate price level.  Overall, the Committee concluded that there were  Inflation Report:  November 1999 44 no strong reasons to change the general shape of the short-term projection for inflation contained in the August Report. With regard to the immediate policy decision, some members, who had favoured a lower inflation projection than the best collective judgment in the August Report, preferred no change in interest rates.  These members considered the recent data to be consistent with the view that competitive pressures on prices and margins were exerting a stronger downward pressure on inflation than in the past.  Furthermore, they thought that a rate rise would probably lead sterling to appreciate, and that this would dampen the recovery that was needed to return inflation to target.  Other members cited the unexpected strength in consumption, developments in the housing and labour markets and the oil price rise as providing a case for a rate increase.  In addition, an early rate rise might lower the level at which interest rates might otherwise need to be set in order to achieve the inflation target.  The Committee voted to increase the repo rate by 25 basis points to 5.25%. At its meeting on 6–7 October, the Committee considered prospects for the world economy in the light of the most recent data.  GDP growth in the United States had slowed in the second quarter, while headline consumer price inflation was increasing.  Final domestic demand continued to grow strongly, and the Federal Open Market Committee had recently adopted a bias towards firmer policy in the future.  In Japan, output growth in Q2 had been higher than expected, although the strong appreciation of the yen, if sustained, could weaken future growth prospects.  Recent data for the euro area continued to show signs of a recovery.  Taking these developments together, the Committee concluded that there had been little change in the outlook for world activity since its previous meeting. Turning to the United Kingdom, the Committee discussed the month’s financial market movements. Both short-term and long-term nominal interest rates had risen, and there was some evidence that real interest rates were also higher.  Equity prices had fallen, and the sterling effective exchange rate had risen.  These movements would tend to restrain demand. Real quarterly GDP growth was stronger than previously estimated for both the first and second quarters.  The most recent retail sales data indicated continued strength in final domestic demand in Q3, and this was consistent with reports from the Bank’s regional Agents and the  Monetary policy since the August Report 45 CBI Distributive Trades Survey.  But both the GfK consumer confidence measure and the CIPS services survey were slightly lower.  The trade data suggested that the stronger export performance in Q2 might have continued into the third quarter, owing to stronger world demand.  Overall, the evidence suggested stronger output growth than had been expected a month earlier, although some Committee members saw a few signs that domestic demand growth could perhaps be moderating. In the labour market, employment growth was no longer slowing, while the Labour Force Survey and claimant count measures of the unemployment rate had again fallen.  The headline growth rate of the Average Earnings Index had risen slightly, while pay settlements continued to fall.  Real earnings growth had risen, which might indicate stronger labour market pressures, although higher real earnings might also have been the result of lower inflation than expected at the time that settlements were agreed. Although higher oil prices had led to a rise in producer input prices, RPIX inflation in the year to August had been a little lower than expected.  Goods price inflation as measured by the retail sales deflator was negative, and most measures of domestically generated inflation had fallen.  A survey by the Bank’s regional Agents had shown widespread discounting in response to competitive pressures.  To the extent that some price reductions were temporary, inflation might be higher in the future.  But if lower prices led to lower inflation expectations and so to lower pay settlements, the effects might be more persistent. In considering the immediate policy decision, the Committee noted the likelihood that output would grow above trend in Q3.  Stronger input prices and a tight labour market posed an upside risk to inflation.  But developments in financial markets over the previous month would tend to restrain demand growth and inflationary pressures in the medium term.  Some Committee members noted that the near-term inflation outlook remained weak, and structural changes that may have occurred in the labour and product markets might dampen the inflationary consequences of stronger activity.  The Committee voted to maintain the Bank’s repo rate at 5.25%. At its meeting on 3–4 November, the Committee voted to raise the Bank’s repo rate from 5.25% to 5.5%.  46 6 Prospects for inflation 6.1 The inflation projection assumptions The Committee approved this Report on 5 November.  It contains the Committee’s assessment of developments in the economy since August and prospects for the medium term.  Charts 6.1 and 6.2 below show projections for GDP growth and RPIX inflation up to two years ahead, and the uncertainties surrounding them.  The projections assume that the Bank’s repo interest rate will remain unchanged at 5.5% during the next two years, and are conditioned on the assumptions described below. There has been a further slight improvement in the prospects for world activity since the August Report. The near-term outlook in the United States remains robust.  Over the next two years, output growth is expected to ease gradually, although the timing and extent of the slowdown remains difficult to gauge. Forward-looking indicators for the euro area have  picked up, supporting the strengthening recovery built in to the projection at the time of the August Report.  And though prospects for the Japanese economy remain uncertain, the outlook appears significantly brighter  than it did three months ago, taking into account  stronger-than-expected GDP growth in the second quarter of the year, indicators of economic activity covering the third quarter, and the recently announced fiscal package.  There has been a pick-up in industrial production in a number of emerging market economies, and prospects have improved over the past three months. Interest rate spreads on emerging market debt over US Treasuries have fallen slightly since the August Report, although they remain at relatively high levels.  Taking these developments together, the MPC has made a further small upward revision to its central projection for world activity.  As world trade strengthens, the most likely outcome is that growth in UK-weighted export markets will rise from around 5% this year to over 7% in 2000, before falling back slightly in 2001.   There remain a number of risks to the world outlook and, although the central projection for world activity has been raised slightly, the Committee judges that the risks around this projection are again weighted to the downside.  For example, the US economy could slow  Prospects for inflation 47 more rapidly than expected, should asset prices fall and domestic demand growth falter.  That would weaken global demand and world trade.  Upward pressures on world prices over the past six months have, on balance, been slightly stronger than projected at the time of the August Report. Manufactured export goods prices were a little higher in the second quarter of the year than expected three months ago.  Moreover, oil prices have been stronger than assumed earlier, as market conditions have tightened further.  In the other direction, the pick-up in non-oil commodity prices in the third quarter was somewhat weaker than expected in August—stronger industrial commodity prices were more than offset by weaker food prices, reflecting good harvests and structural overcapacity in some products.   Although global inflation is expected to remain low, world prices are likely to rise a little faster than projected in August, given the improved outlook for activity. Non-oil commodity prices are expected to rise slightly more quickly than assumed three months ago.  The oil price assumption for the next two years has been raised given higher recent outturns, although the central assumption is that the oil price gradually falls back from current levels to around $18 per barrel for Brent crude oil by the end of 2001.  Prices of manufactured goods and traded services are expected to edge up further, as higher commodity prices continue to feed through.  Taking these elements together, the assumed profile for world prices is slightly stronger than in August, although the risks around this are weighted to the downside given the balance of risks on global activity.  The outlook for UK import prices will be affected by the sterling exchange rate, as well as by the prospects for world prices. The sterling exchange rate has strengthened over the past three months.  The effective exchange rate index (ERI) averaged 105.6 in the 15 working days up to and including 3 November.  This forms the starting-point for the exchange rate profile assumed in the projection.  It compares with a starting-point of 103.1 at the time of the August Report and an implied level of 102.6 for November in the August central projection. All Committee members agree that there is considerable uncertainty about the outlook for the exchange rate.  The Committee reviewed the respective merits of alternative approaches (see the box on page 48).  Based on this review, the Committee agreed to take the average of a  Inflation Report:  November 1999 48 The exchange rate in forecasting and policy analysis Of all the factors affecting inflation and growth prospects, the exchange rate is one of the most important and unpredictable.  Though all agree that the future path of the exchange rate is highly uncertain, there are alternative benchmarks for assessing exchange rate prospects. A constant exchange rate or random walk Perhaps the simplest approach is to assume that the current exchange rate is the best predictor of the future rate. According to this view, a rise in the exchange rate is equally likely as a fall, and the best assumption is that the nominal exchange rate will be constant on average.  In technical language the exchange rate follows a random walk.  Some statistical tests on past data indicate that the random walk hypothesis has performed no worse than— indeed often better than—the uncovered interest parity theory described below.  For this reason, and given the merit in a simple approach, some Committee members were inclined toward this benchmark. Uncovered interest parity The basic theory of uncovered interest parity (UIP) says that, on average, the exchange rate will evolve in line with interest rate differentials (but with random variation around this path as with the random walk hypothesis). This will be true if investment in sterling is expected to do neither better nor worse than investment in, say, euro or dollars. The theory of risk-adjusted UIP says that investment in sterling can have a higher (or lower) expected return than investment in foreign currency if investors perceive investment in sterling to be more (or less) risky than foreign currency.  Some Committee members were inclined towards UIP, in part because they could see no compelling reasons relating to risk to assume that the exchange rate will depreciate at a slower rate than implied by interest rate differentials. Econometric equations Finally, one can attempt to predict exchange rate movements on the basis of econometric analysis of past experience—see, for example, the recent paper on ‘Sterling’s puzzling behaviour’ by Sushil Wadhwani, a member of the Monetary Policy Committee.(1) Econometric exchange rate equations are designed to fit past experience better than other approaches, but views may reasonably differ as to their robustness and hence their predictive power in relation to the future. Nevertheless, some members placed weight on the results of this work. Both UIP and econometric equations offer explanations of some exchange rate movements.  For example, according to UIP, sterling will tend to increase if expected UK interest rates rise relative to expected overseas interest rates.  UIP also implies that the current value of the exchange rate will rise if agents revise up their view of the likely future exchange rate.  Economists typically assume that the expected value of the currency in the medium term represents some form of ‘equilibrium’. The notion that the exchange rate adjusts towards equilibrium is also a common feature in all of the approaches to the exchange rate.  The rationale is that, though exchange rates may depart substantially from their ‘fundamental equilibrium’ values for significant periods, there are forces which will tend to move the rate back towards equilibrium over time.  But there are at least two difficulties:  equilibrium is hard to measure and may change as fundamentals alter, and reversion towards equilibrium may take a long time. The chart compares the forecast profile for the sterling effective exchange rate under alternative approaches.(2) Expected UK interest rates exceed those overseas, and the UIP projection implies that sterling will depreciate by a total of 7.2% over the next two years.  According to the projection based on Dr Wadhwani’s equation, sterling will depreciate by 2.6% over the next two years.  This is rather less than the depreciation implied by interest differentials alone as, according to this particular model, sterling is close to its ‘intermediate equilibrium’. The range of forecasts for sterling implied by these three methods is large, and reflects the major uncertainties surrounding the exchange rate outlook.  For its central projection, the MPC decided to take an average between the current level, as implied by the random walk model, and the path implied by UIP.  On this basis, sterling is assumed to depreciate by 3.6% over the next two years. This is broadly similar to the path given by the econometric equation. Alternative exchange rate projections 96 98 100 102 104 106 108 1997 98 99 2000 01 Effective exchange rate index UIP Constant  Average  of constant  and UIP Equation (1) Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, November 1999, pages 416–27. (2) The projections based on UIP and the econometric equation are adjusted to reflect the forecast assumption that official interest rates remain at their current level of 5.5% over the next two years.  Prospects for inflation 49 constant nominal rate and a path related to the pattern of market interest rate differentials for the central projection.  On this assumption, the sterling ERI declines to 101.8 by the end of the two-year forecast period, consistent with bilateral sterling exchange rates of $1.63 and 0.67 against the euro (equivalent to DM2.93).  In selecting this assumption, some Committee members attached weight to the fact that the path produced by this method is also close to the projection implied by an econometric model of the exchange rate recently estimated by a Committee member.  If, alternatively, the central projection is based on the assumption that the exchange rate moves in line with interest rate differentials, inflation at the two-year horizon would be some 0.3 percentage points higher than in the central projection.  GDP growth would also be rather stronger. On the other hand, holding the nominal exchange rate constant would lower inflation by some 0.3 percentage points at the two-year horizon. All members agree that, whatever assumption is made for the most likely path for sterling, the likelihood of significant deviations from this trajectory is high.  In the event of major changes from the assumed path, the Committee will, as always, review the possible reasons for the movement in the exchange rate and the potential implications for output and inflation. Changes in equity prices affect household wealth and companies’ cost of capital.  The FTSE All-Share index averaged 2835 in the 15 working days up to  3 November, compared with 2960 in the equivalent period three months ago.  The Committee has maintained the assumption that equity prices rise with nominal GDP over the forecast period, from the lower level. The fiscal plans announced by the Chancellor in the March Budget remain the basis for the November projection, although the Committee assumes that some spending that was previously expected to take place in this financial year will now take place in subsequent years.  An overall underspend is judged more likely than an overspend over the three years.  The Committee was briefed by Treasury officials on the autumn Pre-Budget Report in advance of its November meeting.  Previous projections have already incorporated assumptions about the effects of the National Minimum Wage, the New Deal and the Working Time Directive. Preliminary analysis of the effects of the National Minimum Wage suggests that the impact on earnings has  Inflation Report:  November 1999 50 been rather less than earlier judged.  As a result, the Committee has reduced the assumed impact by a third. There is no change to the other assumptions on labour market policy measures in the current projection. 6.2 The output and inflation projections Activity has strengthened more rapidly than expected three months ago.  GDP growth in the first half-year was revised up moderately, and the preliminary estimate for GDP growth in the third quarter was 0.9%, rather higher than the central projection in the August Report.  The implications for the medium-term inflation outlook are not straightforward, however, as the links between activity and inflation remain hard to gauge.  Although activity again appears stronger than earlier expected, recent inflation outturns have once more surprised on the downside.  The Committee revised its projections for activity and inflation against this background. Full information on the composition of demand and output is only available for the first half of the year. Following a quarter of flat activity at the end of 1998, GDP growth at market prices is now estimated to have risen by 0.2% in the first quarter and by 0.6% in the second.  Final domestic demand has grown surprisingly strongly throughout this period, underpinned by robust consumer spending.  Two factors dampened the impact of strong demand on output growth in the first half-year. First, firms reported excess stock levels at the end of 1998 and have subsequently met part of the higher demand by reducing inventories.  Recent surveys suggest that inventories are now more closely aligned with desired levels, suggesting that further strength in demand is likely to be translated into faster output growth.  Second, there was a significant deterioration in the net trade position over the winter months, reducing the growth in overall demand for UK output.  But this effect may now be unwinding as export growth has revived more quickly than expected:  indeed the net trade contribution to growth in the second quarter was positive for the first time in almost two years.  Drawing these elements together, the combination of  higher-than-expected final domestic demand, the improvement in the inventory balance, and stronger net trade performance is consistent with the rather faster pick-up in activity in the second half of this year than in the August projection.   Consumer spending growth has again outstripped earlier expectations.  Expenditure rose by over 1% in the  Prospects for inflation 51 second quarter from an upwardly revised level in the first, and is now some 4% higher than a year ago. Although part of the growth in the first half-year is linked to the new seasonal pattern of spending on cars, which should unwind in the second half-year, the strength of consumer spending is quite broadly based. More timely indicators suggest that underlying consumer spending remains robust.  Retail sales volumes rose by over 1% in the third quarter.  Growth in consumer borrowing has picked up further, and loan approvals data suggest continued increases in the pipeline.  The housing market has strengthened further, consistent with an improvement in consumer sentiment.  And direct surveys of consumer confidence show higher balances in 1999, as fears of rising unemployment have receded and real income growth has remained strong.  Consumer expenditure has recently been rising more rapidly than expected in relation to variables such as labour income, wealth, interest rates and unemployment. Part of this buoyancy might prove temporary, but on balance the Committee concluded that the impact of housing wealth on consumer spending could be stronger than earlier judged, and consequently made a small upward adjustment to the forecast.  Consumer spending is thought likely to remain strong over the next two years, underpinned by rising real labour income, although the Committee judges that growth will slow somewhat as the impetus from the very rapid increase in financial wealth over the past three years gradually fades.  Risks to the spending outlook are assumed to be relatively evenly balanced:  the possibility of a faster than expected rise in house prices and housing wealth is counterbalanced by the possibility of lower equity prices and financial wealth. There has been little change to the outlook for  whole-economy investment.  Although investment was rather weaker than projected in the first half-year, the main reason is that public sector investment fell sharply. Government investment is very volatile from quarter to quarter and the central projection assumes that any shortfall in spending relative to plans this year will be spent over the next two years.  Business investment remains relatively robust, up by more than 11% in the year to the second quarter, although there are some signs that growth may be slowing in line with previous forecasts. Stock levels at the end of the second quarter were in line with the August projection.  Firms have reduced excess  Inflation Report:  November 1999 52 stock levels in the first half-year and inventories now appear to be much closer to desired levels.  The Committee continues to expect that firms will find ways of economising on inventories over the medium term, and that the aggregate stock-output ratio will decline in the long run. Export growth in recent months has been rather stronger than expected in August, although the volatility of monthly and quarterly data makes the trend hard to discern.  On its own, the somewhat stronger outlook for the global economy would improve the prospects for UK exports, but relative to August this is counterbalanced by the assumed higher exchange rate profile over the next two years.  The Committee judges that UK export growth is likely to be broadly in line with UK-weighted world trade. An upward revision to the level of imports in the first half-year has brought import levels more closely into line with earlier expectations.  Nonetheless, import growth was quite weak in the first half-year given the strength of final demand.  One possible explanation is that import demand was temporarily reduced as firms ran down stocks substantially.  If so, there may well be some recovery in import growth in the coming months as the inventory correction ends.  Taking exports and imports together, the Committee judges that the positive net trade contribution to GDP growth seen in the middle of 1999 may be temporary and that negative contributions are more likely through next year.   Bringing the components of demand together, the Committee considers that the near-term outlook for economic activity has strengthened since August.  Final domestic demand is rising more quickly than estimated three months ago, and prospects for the international economy have improved.  Labour market indicators also support the stronger picture.  Employment growth and total hours worked have both risen in recent months, while unemployment has continued to fall on both the LFS and claimant count measures. Evidence from business surveys supports the improved outlook for short-term growth.  Business confidence has strengthened as orders and output expectations have improved.  Agents’ contacts also report a relatively widespread improvement in business confidence over the past three months, although perhaps not to the extent of some of the surveys.  Prospects for inflation 53 Growth is consequently likely to be more rapid in the short term than anticipated in August.  But these higher growth rates might not be sustained.  Higher interest rates, a stronger exchange rate and rather lower equity prices than in the August projection will all act to moderate GDP growth during next year.  Quarterly growth rates are expected to settle a little above trend in the current central projection:  the four-quarter growth profile is less smooth as this is affected by the pattern of rapidly rising growth through 1999. The central projection for the four-quarter growth rate of GDP at constant market prices shows the sharper recovery through 1999 than in the August projection (see Chart 6.1).(1) Growth may now reach the 2.5%–3% range around the end of the year.  But, as in August, the four-quarter growth rate is then expected to level off around this level, as domestic demand growth moderates and world trade growth stabilises.  However, because of the stronger growth through 1999 and the resulting higher level of output, the pressure of demand on supply capacity will be rather higher over the next two years than assumed in August. As highlighted in the August Report, there are considerable uncertainties surrounding the links between the trends in economic activity and changes in inflationary pressure.  Developments over the past three months underline that uncertainty.  As in the previous quarter, the news on demand and activity in recent months has surprised on the upside.  But although some indicators of inflationary pressure, such as nominal earnings growth, have risen by more than expected, measures of retail price inflation have fallen.  In particular, RPIX inflation was again weaker than projected three months ago.  The outturn in the third quarter was 0.1 percentage points lower than the central projection in the August Report, as RPIX inflation edged further below the target. Monetary indicators provide mixed signals on the outlook.  Official interest rates are higher than in August. Narrow money growth has moderated in recent months but remains fairly strong.  Broad money growth has slowed to the lowest level since the current data series began in 1963, but the recent deceleration has again been largely accounted for by a contraction in deposits by financial companies, which may have little immediate implication for nominal demand.  Household Divisia money growth remains strong, which is consistent with (1) Also shown as Chart 1 in the Overview.

Credit growth to households—especially secured lending—has risen further, and broad measures of private  non-financial company funding, including capital issues as well as bank borrowing, remain quite buoyant. Pay pressures appear rather stronger than expected three months ago.  The headline rate of growth in the Average Earnings Index reached 4.9% in August, similar to the level six months ago, but some 0.6 percentage points higher than three months ago.  Movements from month to month remain quite volatile and are consequently assigned limited weight by the Committee.  But smoothing the series by taking longer-run averages suggests that underlying earnings growth may have edged upward in recent months.  Supporting this view, the Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services reports a rise in pay growth for staff recruited through agencies.  On the other hand, the Reward Index is indicating lower earnings growth, and pay settlements remain generally subdued.   Although bargains are typically struck in nominal terms, wage negotiators are ultimately concerned with the outcome for real earnings, as this determines employees’ ability to buy goods and services and affects employers’ ability to earn profit.  On most measures, real earnings growth has picked up somewhat over the past year. Recent growth has been rather faster than projected  three months ago, even after allowing for the  stronger-than-expected labour market data.  The Committee reviewed alternative explanations that may have different implications for the outlook for earnings. One potential explanation was that in the August forecast, the Committee had overestimated the extent of the improvement in the structure of the labour market in recent years, and so had underestimated real earnings pressure for a given level of unemployment.  An alternative explanation was that recent inflation outturns had been much lower than expected, particularly on the RPI measure, but also in terms of RPIX.  Some of the recent increase in real earnings might consequently reflect the surprising fall in inflation relative to expectations at the time wage contracts were agreed, rather than any impact of labour market tightness.  The Committee agreed that the recent evidence was particularly hard to read given the conflicting data and possible interpretations, and that there remained considerable uncertainty surrounding the prospects for earnings.  Weighing the arguments, the Committee  Prospects for inflation 55 considers that, while there may be some volatility in the recent outturns, the data are consistent with a higher profile for real earnings than in the August central projection, and an adjustment was made to the central projection to reflect this.  Risks around the earnings profile are assumed to be evenly balanced.  Some Committee members, who place greater weight on structural improvements in the labour market, prefer a weaker earnings profile which would lower RPIX inflation by 0.2 percentage points at the two-year horizon. The impact of earnings on firms’ unit costs is moderated by productivity growth.  Following a period of slowing productivity growth last year as the economy cooled, there have been further signs of a rebound in recent months, as the recovery in activity gathers momentum. The Committee has maintained the assumptions from previous forecasts that productivity growth per hour will continue to pick up, returning to its long-run historical average over the next 18 months or so, and that structural improvements in labour market flexibility have reduced the variability of productivity over the cycle.  Recent evidence does not, however, support the judgment from previous forecasts that average hours worked per person are likely to rise more quickly than in the past in the recovery phase of the cycle.  The previous adjustment has been removed.  The implication is that the level of employment is higher for any given demand for labour, which adds slightly to inflationary pressure overall. Cost pressures have been rather stronger than expected three months ago, reflecting the pick-up in earnings growth and higher oil prices.  But consumer price inflation has remained low.  RPIX inflation has dropped further below target to 2.1%;  and averaged around  0.1 percentage points lower in the third quarter than projected in August.  Some of the unexpected weakness in inflation can be accounted for by the recent decline in seasonal food prices, which may not persist.  However, price-cost margins also seem to have been rather lower than previously assumed, consistent with more widespread discounting and greater competitive pressure. The Committee re-examined the prospects for price-cost margins over the next two years in the light of more evidence of downward pressures on margins and prices. Competitive forces appeared to be intensifying in a number of sectors, linked to factors such as greater  Inflation Report:  November 1999 56 international penetration of domestic markets, as barriers to trade and to market entry have declined, and to information technology advances which were offering savings on distribution networks, more transparent pricing, and encouraging new business opportunities. The Committee recognises that these broad structural forces have been affecting economic conditions for some time, but judges that recent developments are consistent with an intensification of the trends, which could therefore affect the near-term inflation outlook.  It was consequently agreed to incorporate an adjustment in the central projection to take account of a structural reduction in the level of margins in some sectors. Although there is considerable uncertainty about both the magnitude and duration of the impact, the adjustment in the central projection assumes that these effects take place throughout the forecast period, reducing measured inflation by around 0.2 percentage points in both the first and second years of the projection.  Risks around the central projection for  price-cost margins are viewed as symmetric.  Some Committee members prefer an alternative assumption with the same downward adjustment to the price level and measured inflation in the first year, but with no further change thereafter.  On this assumption, inflation at the two-year horizon would be higher by some  0.2 percentage points relative to the central projection. Regulatory developments are also putting downward pressure on prices.  The Committee reviewed these effects separately.  The small downward adjustment to the level of margins from 2000 Q2 to reflect OFWAT recommendations on water prices was maintained.  A further adjustment of a broadly similar size was made to reflect recent proposals on domestic electricity prices. These factors reduce the level of prices, and for a year lower measured inflation.  Neither of these adjustments significantly affects measured RPIX inflation at the end of the two-year period.  However, a further adjustment has been made to reflect lower electricity prices for business users, which, given the transmission lags, has some effect at the two-year horizon. Putting these elements together, the Committee’s best collective projection for the twelve-month RPIX inflation rate—based on the assumption that nominal interest rates are held constant at 5.5% is shown in  Chart 6.2.(1) Alongside is the projection from the August Report, which was based on constant interest rates at 5% (see Chart 6.3).

Inflation is projected to remain below target for much of the forecast period, declining further to just below 2% over the next twelve to eighteen months, before picking up in the central projection to the target level by the end of 2001, as pressures build from the sustained period of above-trend activity growth and as the temporary effects on measured inflation from lower domestic water and electricity prices unwind.  The differences from the previous projection are relatively small overall as a number of the influences have moved in offsetting directions.  Relative to August, upward pressure on inflation from higher real earnings, higher world prices and rather stronger domestic activity are broadly counterbalanced by additional downward pressure from a stronger exchange rate, higher interest rates and lower price-cost margins.  The starting-point is lower than in August, as inflation has fallen more rapidly than expected.  The short-term profile is also a little weaker, and so the projected trough in inflation is rather lower than three months ago.  The projected  pick-up in inflation during 2001 from the deeper trough is a little sharper than in August as some of the benign influences which are temporarily suppressing inflation fade. Risks around the central projection for both activity and inflation are weighted to the downside in both years, primarily reflecting the possibility of a weaker outlook  Inflation Report:  November 1999 58 Chart 6.4 Current projection for the percentage increase  in RPIX in the year to 2001 Q4 0 1 2 3 4 5 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Probability in per cent (a) Inflation 90% probability (b) Chart 6.5 August projection for the percentage increase in RPIX in the year to 2001 Q3     5      4      3      2      1         0  0 1 2 4 5 6 3 Probability in per cent (a) 90% probability (b) -1 Inflation Source:  Bank of England.

Other risks are judged to be broadly offsetting.  Charts 6.4 and 6.5 show the overall balance of risks to inflation at the two-year horizon.  Table 6.A presents the Committee’s best collective judgment of the probabilities of various outcomes for inflation and GDP growth. There remain a number of major uncertainties in the outlook where difficult judgments are required to produce the projections.  On some issues, certain Committee members prefer to take a different view in forming their best estimate of the most likely outcome. These judgments are not incorporated explicitly in the fan charts or in Table 6.A, but are shown in Table 6.B. The table presents broad illustrative calibrations of the possible effects on RPIX inflation and GDP growth of the alternative assumptions. These alternative assumptions shown in Table 6.B are viewed by the Committee as a series of separate judgments.  The net effect of the alternative assumptions preferred by different Committee members gives rise to a range of views about inflation prospects, highlighting the uncertainties and difficulties in forming judgments on the outlook.  These varying assumptions could either raise or lower the inflation rate at the two-year horizon by 1/4 to 1/2 percentage points.

Forward rates have risen a little since the August Report.  The latest evidence from this curve implies that market expectations are for official rates to rise over the next eighteen months to two years, peaking at around 61/2%.  As a result, the MPC’s projections under the assumption that official rates move in line with market expectations are for significantly weaker activity and lower inflation than in the constant interest rate case (see Charts 6.6 and 6.7).  If the short sterling futures curve were used instead to gauge the outlook for official rates, market expectations are that official rates would rise to around 7%.  If rates followed this path, inflation at the two-year horizon would be lower by a further  0.1 percentage points relative to the projection in  Chart 6.6. 6.3 Other forecasts Chart 6.8 shows the distribution of central forecasts for the twelve-month rate of RPIX inflation in 2001 Q4, based on information from 28 forecasters surveyed by the Bank in late October.  The mean forecast for inflation in the year to 1999 Q4 was 2.1%, rising to 2.3% in  2000 Q4 (with a range of 1.7% to 2.9%), and reaching 2.5% in 2001 Q4 (with a range of 1.8% to 3.1%).

Inflation Report:  November 1999 60 estimates for 2000 and 2001 are slightly lower than the projections made at the time of the July survey.  The forecasters assign a probability of around 45% to inflation being above target in the final quarter of 2001, and a probability of around 55% to it being below  (see Table 6.C).  These estimates have changed moderately since the August Report, with more weight placed on lower outturns for inflation. The forecasters’ average projection for GDP growth in the year to 2000 Q4 is 23/4% (with a range of projections from 11/4% to 31/2%), falling slightly to 21/2% in the year to 2001 Q4 (with a range of 11/4% to 31/2%).  The estimate for 2000 Q4 is slightly higher than at the time of the August Report. For the first time, the forecasters provided the Bank with their central projections for the official interest rate and the sterling ERI.  The forecasters’ average projection for the official interest rate in 2000 Q4 is 6% (with a range of 5% to 63/4%), falling slightly to 53/4% by 2001 Q4 (with a range of 41/2% to 71/4%).  On average, the forecasters assume that the sterling ERI will fall to 100.3 by 2000 Q4 (with a range of 93.0 to 107.5), and to 97.3 by 2001 Q4 (with a range of 91.0 to 107.0)—a steeper fall than assumed in the MPC’s central projection in this Report.  Charts 6.9 and 6.10 show the distribution of the forecasters’ assumptions about the repo rate and the sterling ERI respectively. The implications of the latest projections for the stance of monetary policy are discussed in the Overview at the beginning of this Report.

The world economy 2 The Committee discussed whether there had been any material changes to the world economic outlook, or in the balance of risks, since its May Inflation Report.  Recent data suggested that the US economy was slowing;  GDP growth had fallen from 1.1% in 1999 Q1 to 0.6% in 1999 Q2, a weaker outturn than widely expected.  Taken together with a lower equity market and a slight fall in consumer confidence, this suggested that the probability of a ‘soft landing’ had increased.  Some doubts were, however, expressed about this.  First, much of the fall in output growth between Q1 and Q2 was accounted for by inventory changes, which might unwind.  Second, whether or not a soft landing was achieved might depend on labour market developments.  There were signs that recent benign outcomes for productivity and unit labour costs might be fading.  That could in turn lead to a tightening of monetary policy.  Taking these points together, there remained  a risk of the US economy slowing more sharply than assumed  in the Committee’s central projection, particularly if equity prices fell. 3 In the euro area, the backward looking data generally remained weak.  Area-wide industrial production had fallen again in May, although output growth in a number of the smaller economies—for example Spain, Netherlands, Belgium—was stronger than had been expected by most commentators.   Forward-looking indicators had strengthened somewhat, but were still mixed.  On the one hand, there were signs that business sentiment had improved in the largest economies;  for example, the IFO survey in Germany and the INSEE survey in France had both risen strongly in June.  On the other hand, surveys for each of France, Germany and Italy suggested that orders were still falling, implying that some downside risks persisted.  The Committee noted that various ECB statements had been taken by the market to suggest that monetary policy was more likely to be tightened than eased.  It seemed that this was against a background of stronger growth in the monetary aggregates and rising energy prices, and could reflect a judgment that the amount of cyclical slack in the euro-area economy was smaller than might be inferred from the level of unemployment. 4 It now seemed less likely that Japanese GDP growth would fall by as much in 1999 Q2 as had been thought the previous month.  More generally, the downside risks were not yet materialising.  It was also possible that, if they did, the Japanese government would employ fiscal policy to try to offset any weakening in aggregate demand.  However, worries remained.  It was unclear how potential problems in the insurance sector might be resolved and whether and how they might affect the economic outlook.  Market commentators had expressed concerns about the yen, which had risen against the dollar over the previous month after the earlier efforts to hold it down via exchange market intervention. 5 Taken as a whole the crisis-affected emerging market economies continued to recover.  But the environment remained fragile, as evidenced by the generalised rise in interest rate spreads since the May Inflation Report.  Financial markets were, in particular, discounting some possibility of a Chinese devaluation, although on the whole commentators seemed to think that unlikely this year.  There also seemed to be renewed worries about Korea. Partly against a background of uncertainty about official policy towards corporate restructuring, the equity market had fallen around 10% following the announcement of problems at Daewoo, although the market had subsequently recovered.  There remained a longer-term downside risk to the world economic outlook from the slow pace and gradual effect of corporate and financial sector reform in emerging market economies. 6 Overall, compared with May, the Committee had raised its central projection for world output growth, but the balance of risks was on the downside.  Some risks to the outlook—for example, a sharp fall in world equity markets or a resumption of severe problems in emerging market economies—could not sensibly be anticipated by UK monetary policy, but rather the Committee would need to consider how to react if and when such contingencies occurred. 7 The Committee noted that world price inflation had typically been coming out lower than expected given the path of world output growth.  This was partly attributable to there having for some time been stronger than expected falls in oil and commodity prices.  That was less likely in the period ahead given the projected pick-up in world economic growth.  Oil prices had already risen sharply. Monetary and financial conditions 8 The twelve-month rate of aggregate broad money growth had fallen to 5.6% in June, the lowest since March 1995.  However, the aggregate data masked considerable sectoral differences.  Most of the slowdown was accounted for by a fall in sterling deposits held by other financial institutions.  By contrast, annual household M4 growth, at 6.8% in 1999 Q2, was the highest for almost two years. Household borrowing was also accelerating;  the 8% growth in the year to 1999 Q2 was the highest since 1990 Ql.  Mortgage lending had picked up and approvals were still strong. 9 The twelve-month growth rate of M0 had reached 7.3% in July, with the annualised three-month rate at 8.8%.  In part this was attributable to the earlier reductions in nominal interest rates, which would be expected to reduce the velocity of circulation of  non-interest bearing money balances.  But, taken together with the broad money and credit numbers, it also seemed to corroborate the quickening pace of household sector spending growth seen in recent consumption data and in surveys. 10 There had still been only limited pass through into headline mortgage and deposit rates of the Committee’s most recent interest rate reductions.  Views differed on the reliability of headline rates as indicators of the interest rates at which lending and borrowing business was actually occuring, with some Committee members noting the apparent intensification of competition—and increases in special, non-headline deals—in these markets. 11 The sterling interest rate curve had continued to steepen out to around three years, so that it was now distinctly humped.  Since April, the three-month interbank rate implied by the June 2001 short sterling futures contract had risen by about 150 basis points; the rate implied by the September 2000 contract had risen 50 basis points over the previous month.  Market comment had suggested that the curve might have been distorted by some large transactions in thin markets, in which case it was possible that the effect would be temporary and that market rates were not accurately reflecting market expectations of the future path of official interest rates. Nevertheless, business was conducted at those rates, and so the Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 4–5 August 1999  Inflation Report:  November 1999 64 steepening represented a degree of tightening in monetary and credit conditions. 12 In this connection, it was suggested that the effect on the economic outlook of the increase in medium maturity market rates might be greater than reflected in the Bank’s projections;  it was unclear how the term structure of interest rates affected consumption and investment spending.  Separately, the Committee noted that a projection for inflation using market interest rates was on this occasion materially below the one assuming a constant official interest rate. 13 The sterling exchange rate index stood at 103.3, compared with 103.5 implied by the May projection modal path.  The fifteen day average—the starting point for the August forecast—was 103.1.  As had been discussed at the Committee’s previous meeting, it still seemed that sterling was less tightly tied to the dollar than a few months earlier.  The euro had also continued to strengthen, for which two possible explanations were identified. First, expected euro-area monetary conditions might have tightened on account of stronger expected euro-area growth and ECB statements.  Second, the euro’s recent recovery might reflect a reduced risk premium.  During 1998 the Committee had attributed part of sterling’s strength against ‘In’ currencies to the inevitable uncertainties about how the single monetary policy would operate, with an expectation that some of this risk premium in sterling’s favour would erode as familiarity with the ECB increased.  If so, the euro might continue to strengthen against sterling, and by more than implied by interest rate differentials.  In the view of some members, there were other reasons why sterling might depreciate by more than uncovered-interest parity implied.  The increased UK trade deficit would put downward pressure on the real exchange rate which, given inflation prospects in the UK and abroad, implied the likelihood of a lower nominal rate. 14 However, views differed on the likely path of sterling.  Most members supported continuing to use the convention of  uncovered-interest parity in the central projection, under which the path of sterling would be linked to market interest rate differentials, adjusted for the forecast convention of a constant sterling interest rate.  Some members, however, preferred to use the alternative convention of a constant sterling EM over the forecast period, on a view that the least-bad hypothesis for forecasting exchange rate behaviour was a random walk.  It was noted that no methods or conventions for forecasting the exchange rate had a good record. The alternative approach would reduce the central projection for inflation by around 0.4 percentage points at the two-year forecast horizon, and the output growth central projection by about  0.2 percentage points. Demand and output 15 There had been some significant changes to the National Accounts data.  They now showed that the slowdown in 1998 Q4 and 1999 Q1, when output growth had been flat, was accounted  for entirely by changes in stocks and net trade.  Final domestic demand (ie excluding investment in stocks) had continued to grow strongly. 16 The quarterly rate of output growth was back to 0.5% in 1999 Q2, the same as from 1997 Q4 to 1998 Q3, and slightly faster than had been assumed in the Committee’s May central projection. Manufacturing output had grown by 0.4% in Q2, the first quarterly increase for a year.  Compared with May, there was thus harder evidence of the recovery since the winter.  Forward-looking survey data had also continued to strengthen.  The quarterly CBI Business Optimism balance had risen from -6 in April to +5 in July, above the long term average.  The CIPS manufacturing output index was 55 in July, the fourth consecutive month it had been above 50 and its highest level since March 1998.   The CIPS services output index was 58 in July, the highest since April 1998.  Indicators of household expenditure were robust.  For example, retail sales were stronger than expected in the second quarter.  House prices were rising faster than expected in May, although with considerable variation among the regions.  For the country as a whole, the July Halifax index was up around 8% on a year ago, with most of the increase over the most recent period;  the index was up 6% on a quarter ago and 2% on a month ago.  Housing market activity indicators—particulars delivered and mortgage approvals—were also increasing.  Not everything was strengthening, however. Consumer confidence, as measured by GfK, had fallen in July, for the first time since November 1998.  The Bank’s regional Agents had reported that their contacts indicated that consumer demand might not be as firm as suggested by recent official data. 17 The Committee discussed the possible implications of the very different picture that the official data now painted of the slowdown last year and the early part of this year.  The persistent strength of final domestic demand was striking.  It had earlier been thought that part of the background to the stock adjustment had been slowing consumer and business final demand.  The latest data did not support that story.  A number of possible explanations were identified.  First, the latest data themselves might be revised. Second, monetary policy might have stabilised the path of final domestic demand growth.  The tightening during 1997 and into 1998 might have dampened an acceleration otherwise underway; and the subsequent easing of policy in the US, UK and elsewhere might have offset the shocks from the emerging market crises and the sharp fall in business and consumer confidence in the autumn, by helping to prevent a credit crunch and restore confidence. Third, the monetary policy changes might not have had much effect at all, with confidence spontaneously recovering as the real economy adjusted to the autumn shocks.  It was unclear which, if any, of these possible explanations was most plausible. 18 Connected to this, views differed on whether the evidence suggested that the lags in the monetary transmission mechanism were now shorter.  On one argument, the greater credibility of the new monetary regime might mean that monetary policy changes have a stronger impact on confidence, which may translate more quickly into spending decisions and pricing behaviour.  On another argument, it was difficult to conclude whether or not monetary policy changes had in fact made much difference to the recent path of the economy, let alone whether there was evidence of a permanent and general change in the transmission mechanism.  The shocks to the economy last autumn had been highly unusual.  It was possible that monetary policy could work quickly in averting a credit crunch—restoring financial market stability and wider confidence—in those particular circumstances, but that the transmission mechanism had not changed more generally. 19 Views also differed somewhat about the implications of the latest data for the outlook.  On the one hand, it was possible that the economy was now on an even keel, recovering nicely towards trend.  On the other hand, the economy could overheat if a recovery in stockbuilding, the planned pick up in public expenditure, and a smaller negative contribution to aggregate demand from net trade coincided with persistent final domestic demand strength, fuelled by rising house prices and official interest rates being significantly lower than before last autumn’s disturbance. 20 Overall, given the latest data, the Committee assumed faster consumption growth in its central projection than in May;  and also faster house price growth, which would itself increase consumption growth somewhat.  The balance of risks to the consumption profile were judged to be on the upside over the next year or so. Labour market conditions 21 The Committee had been predicting falling employment, but that had not happened despite the slowdown in activity.  The unemployment rate had been almost flat, at around 6.2% on the Labour Force Survey measure, since the middle of 1998.  Inactivity levels continued to fall.  Monetary Policy Committee 65 22 The labour market prices data posed some difficult and important puzzles against that background.  The twelve month mean of private sector pay settlements was 3.5%, compared with 3.8% at the end of 1998, and 4.2% a year ago.  Earnings growth, as measured by the twelve-month change in the Average Earnings Index, had fallen sharply in April and May, although it was difficult to assess the significance of this given that a lot of bonuses were paid in these months and bonuses were thought to be lower this year than last year.  Data in subsequent months might provide clearer information on the underlying picture. 23 While nominal earnings growth had fallen, it seemed that real earnings growth had been rising.  This divergence between the paths of real and nominal growth might be explained by a fall in  ex ante inflation expectations or by lower inflation outturns than were expected when wage bargains had been struck.  However, although real earnings growth had risen relative to nominal earnings growth, it had still been lower than would have been predicted given the levels of employment and unemployment.  This might suggest some degree of structural change in the labour market. 24 There was, however, a range of views on the outlook for earnings.  While the Committee as a whole agreed that real earnings growth would be slower, for any given output path, than assumed in May, there were differences on the appropriate size of adjustment to the May projection assumptions, hinging on differences on the extent of any structural changes.  On one view, the adjustment made in the best collective central projection was too big.  Labour markets conditions were tight.  The BCC had reported continuing recruitment difficulties.  The CBI had reported a slight increase in skill shortages, and the balance of manufacturing companies reporting shortages of unskilled labour were at the highest since 1974.  The Bank’s regional Agents were also reporting that businesses were experiencing problems in hiring at the lower end of the skills range.  On this view, the most likely outturn for RPIX would be 0.2 percentage points higher than the best collective central projection at the two year horizon. 25 Another view placed weight on the fact that neither nominal earnings growth nor RPIX inflation had picked up over the year or so during which unemployment had been stable at around 6.2%. This suggested that continuing structural reforms had had the effect of materially reducing the level of unemployment at which inflation would start to increase.  In consequence, the outlook for earnings growth was more benign than assumed in the Committee’s best collective central projection.  On this view, the most likely outturn for RPIX at the two year horizon would be 0.2 percentage points lower. Prices and costs 26 There had been continuing downward pressure on UK import prices from sterling’s appreciation, but the rate of import price deflation was slowing.  Non-oil commodity prices had, on the Bank index, risen by 0.6% in the year to June, so that there had now been price rises for three consecutive months after thirty-three months of falling prices. 27 Oil prices had increased by about 6% over the month to above $19 per barrel, partly reflecting higher expected world economic growth.  The Committee assumed a price of $17 per barrel throughout the forecast period in the best collective central projection, higher than in May but with some unwinding of the most recent price increase.  Some members preferred using $19 per barrel either in the central projection or as an upside risk.  This would add 0.2 percentage points to RPIX inflation at the end of the forecast horizon. 28 The Committee debated the outlook for pricing behaviour in the economy.  A majority did not want to make any changes to the assumptions made in the Committee’s earlier projections.  Some members, however, believed that there were significant changes underway in product markets via greater use of information technology in distribution, via the entry of large, low cost competitors, and via an intensification of competitive pressures driven by regulatory developments.  They believed that these changes could bring about a structural reduction in the level of profit margins in some sectors.  While the adjustment was occuring, inflation would be lower than would otherwise be the case for any given path of output growth and real earnings growth.  On this view, RPIX inflation could be 0.2 percentage points lower at the two-year forecast horizon than on the best collective central projection. The August inflation and growth projections 29 The Committee agreed the projections to be published in the Inflation Report on 11 August. 30 On the assumption of constant official interest rates of  5.0%, the best collective judgment of the central projection for output growth was for stronger growth than in the May Report. Growth was projected to get back to around trend by the end of this year, after which it continued rising to around 3%, where it levelled off. 31 The Committee’s best collective projection for RPIX had broadly the same saucer shape as in May, but with a number of differences.  There was a lower starting point, and the trough of slightly below 2% was lower than in May.  Inflation was projected to rise to above the 21/2% target by the end of the two-year forecast period, when it was still increasing.  The balance of risks was slightly on the upside. 32 As already described, there was considerable uncertainty in the Committee about the inflation outlook, and there was a range of preferred assumptions for the central projection.  Various members had different preferred assumptions for the path of the nominal exchange rate, earnings growth, pricing behaviour/profit margins, and the oil price;  these were presented in Table 6.B on page 53 of the Inflation Report published on 11 August. 33 Different members preferred different combinations of these assumptions.  Some preferred assumptions that would lower the central projection at the two-year horizon by between 0.2 and  0.6 percentage points.  Some preferred an assumption (on earnings growth) which would raise the central projection by 0.2 percentage points at that horizon. 34 The Committee also reviewed the range of outside forecasts based on a variety of different assumptions.  The mean forecast for RPIX inflation was 2.1% for the twelve months to 1999 Q4, 2.4% in 2000 Q4, and 2.6% in 2001 Q3.  While the mean shorter run forecast was lower than in the April survey, the 2000 and 2001 forecasts were higher.  The probability assigned to inflation being above 21/2% in 2001 Q3 was just over 50%, higher than in May. The immediate policy decision 35 The Committee agreed that there was much to welcome in the current conjuncture.  Output growth was recovering back towards trend faster than had been expected.  Unemployment was lower than for a long time.  There was, however, great uncertainty in the Committee about the extent to which the recent improvement in the relationship between activity and price inflation would persist, and about whether the lags in the monetary transmission mechanism had become shorter.  There was, accordingly, a wide range of views about the medium-term prospect for inflation, reflected in different members of the Committee having different preferred assumptions for the central projection;  assuming a constant 5.0% repo rate, there was a difference of about  0.8 percentage points between the highest and lowest inflation rates  Inflation Report:  November 1999 66 which individual members of the Committee thought most likely at the two-year forecast horizon. 36 Against this background, different members of the Committee emphasised different aspects in reaching their policy judgments.  Some members emphasised that the quarterly forecasting round was the occasion on which, notwithstanding the considerable uncertainties, all the factors influencing the inflation outlook could be weighed together and expressed in a coherent quantitative framework, with a disciplined—although not mechanical—link between a member’s assessment of the outlook and their policy judgment, given the Committee’s remit of an explicit inflation target.  Others placed emphasis in addition on the increased uncertainty about the relationship between activity and price inflation, and about the transmission mechanism. 37 For some members of the Committee, the question was whether or not there was a case for a further reduction in rates now. While most features of the conjuncture were welcome, inflation was below the target and set to remain so for some time.  On this view, the most likely outlook for inflation was, furthermore, even weaker than implied by the best collective central projection. Those members taking this view placed weight, in different degrees, on alternative assumptions:  a constant nominal exchange rate together with either weaker earnings growth or a downward adjustment to profit margins.  One such member would also have preferred a number of other adjustments to the best collective central projection:  in particular, slightly higher oil prices and slightly stronger consumption, offset to some extent by tighter than assumed monetary and credit conditions on account of the incomplete pass through of previous rate reductions and the steep rise in medium maturity market interest rates.  Taken together, these considerations pointed towards a further reduction in interest rates.  However, various arguments against an immediate reduction were identified.  First, in the view of one member, the current nominal rate was around neutral, and the case for changing rates therefore had to be more compelling than usual given the inherent self-correcting characteristics of the economy.  Second, nominal interest rates were lower than for many years so that, if there were residual inflation illusion or if borrowers were credit constrained, the upside risks to consumption growth might be greater than assumed.  Third, there was considerable uncertainty about the outlook.  That pointed towards caution in changing policy.  In particular, there was a case for waiting to assess the extent to which the performance of the labour market had improved.  Fourth, an immediate rate cut, which would be unexpected, might have a much larger-than-normal effect on house prices and sterling, which could have a significant impact on the resulting modal projection of inflation.  Fifth, although some members preferred a modal projection for inflation a little below 21/2% in two years’ time, for some of them the balance of risks was on the upside.  Overall, the best course this month was to leave rates unchanged. 38 For some other members of the Committee, the question was more whether or not there was a case for tightening policy this month.  Domestic demand growth was already stronger than expected and was projected to increase, with clear upside risks to consumer spending, particularly if house prices continued to rise sharply.  It was unlikely that net trade would continue to make a negative contribution to output growth for much longer.  There was a risk that output growth would not level off over the next year or so but would continue to increase.  In any event, there could be upwards inflationary pressure at the end of the forecast period, when the best collective central projection was already above the  21/2% target and rising.  Some of the members who held these concerns about the risks to the inflation outlook would also have preferred a somewhat higher central projection for inflation as they thought the most likely path for earnings growth was faster than assumed.  However, even with that adjustment the central projection would be below the target until 2001 Q3.  Moreover, monetary and credit conditions had already tightened somewhat through the rise in medium term market interest rates.  Taking these considerations together, although it seemed more likely than not that there would at some point need to be a tightening of monetary policy in order to meet the inflation target, the Committee was in a position to wait for more evidence.  That might help to resolve some of the uncertainties about consumption;  about earnings, where there would be data less affected by bonus payments;  and about the length of the transmission lags and about pricing behaviour;  as well as more evidence on the exchange rate.  In consequence, there was time to take any restraining action later,  if and when it was more clearly needed.  Overall, for these members too, the best course this month was to leave rates unchanged. 39 Other members placed less weight on the arguments for a further reduction or for a pre-emptive tightening.  On the one hand, a cut would take imprudent risks with the pace of increase in household spending and with house prices.  It could well be taken badly by the financial markets, leading to a rise in longer term inflation expectations and nominal bond yields.  While inflation was set to be below the target for a period, that largely reflected the unexpected shocks to the world economy last autumn;  monetary policy could not sensibly try to offset the short-run effects of all shocks as it had to be forward looking.  It was conceivable that the relationship between activity and price inflation had become substantially more benign, but more evidence was needed;  some past UK monetary policy mistakes had stemmed in part from over optimism about the possibility of permanent changes in the economy.  On the other hand, a tightening would be premature and overly cautious, and could even prompt questions about whether the target was truly symmetric.  The economy was recovering nicely, helped by the earlier easing of policy;  and inflationary pressures were fairly muted in the short run.  There were risks further out, but there was time to gather more evidence before any action was needed to dampen any incipient inflationary pressure.  On this view too, the best course this month was to leave rates unchanged. 40 The Governor invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate be maintained at 5.0%.  The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the proposition.  41 The following members of the Committee were present: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers Sushil Wadhwani 42 Andrew Turnbull was present as the Treasury representative.  Monetary Policy Committee 67 l This Annex summarises the analysis presented by the Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee on 30 July, in advance of its meeting on 4–5 August 1999.  At the start of the Committee meeting itself members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and that information is included in the Annex. I The international economy 2 GDP growth in the United States had slowed in the second quarter, according to the preliminary estimate.  Following growth of 1.1% in the first quarter, GDP was estimated to have risen by 0.6% in the second, a weaker outturn than most commentators had been expecting.  The recovery in industrial production had remained weak, although the twelve-month growth rate had picked up in June because of base effects from the 1998 strike at General Motors.  Industrial orders and housing starts had also weakened, the latter possibly reflecting the rise in mortgage rates as well as earlier weather-related effects.  Slowing retail sales growth had pointed to slower consumption growth.  The labour market had continued to tighten however:  employment growth had continued to be more rapid than growth in the working-age population, while employment costs had risen by 1.1% in 1999 Q2.  This was the largest quarterly rise in employment costs since 1991 Q2 and was well above market expectations.  However, this had followed much weaker growth in employment costs in 1999 Q1, and the  two-quarter growth in employment costs still seemed subdued compared with the same two quarters of 1998.  Broad money growth had weakened and producer price pressures had remained muted, but deflationary pressures from intermediate and crude producer prices had diminished. 3 In May the twelve-month growth rate of euro-area industrial production had remained negative.  However, there had been signs that production was nearing a trough and forward-looking indicators had improved:  the German IFO index and the French INSEE survey had both risen strongly in June.  With business confidence improving but consumer confidence falling, the gap between business confidence and consumer confidence had continued to narrow in June.  Broad money had grown by an annual rate of 5.1% in the three months to June, not far from the European Central Bank’s (ECB) reference value of 4.5%.  But private sector credit had continued to grow strongly, at an annual rate of 10.9%. Euro area headline inflation had fallen slightly in June, but inflation differentials within the euro area had persisted. 4 Japanese retail sales had remained weak, falling by 2.5% in the twelve months to June.  However real disposable income had risen by 1.1% in the same period, and the fall in the annual growth rate of retail sales had masked a 0.2% quarterly rise in 1999 Q2. Moreover, household expenditure had grown more strongly than retail sales.  Industrial production had grown by 3.0% in June; while this growth had been much stronger than most commentators expected, industrial output had still fallen by 1.0% in the second quarter.  The Tankan survey had shown that firms could in principle obtain credit more easily, but investment plans had remained subdued.  This might have explained why bank lending had continued to slow in June.  The twelve-month growth rate of Ml had risen to 12.2%, but base money growth had slowed.  Moreover, simple monetary policy rules had suggested that monetary policy might still be too tight. 5 In the financial markets the dollar had depreciated against the euro and the yen since the July MPC meeting.  Equity prices in the United States, Japan and the euro area had fallen.  Short-term yields had increased by around 25 basis points for the year 2000 in the United States over the month as a whole, and had risen in the euro area, with the ECB highlighting the consequences of stronger growth.  The outlook for emerging markets had generally improved, although Argentina looked if anything more fragile and problems at Daewoo had affected financial markets in Korea. II Monetary and financial conditions 6 Narrow money growth had risen in July, notes and coin growing by 0.8% in the month.  After adjusting for the introduction of the new 50 pence coin and the £2 coin, the twelve-month growth rates of notes and coin and M0 had risen, between June and July, from 7.0% to 7.4% and from 7.2% to 7.5%, respectively.  In both cases, this had represented a rise of more than 2 percentage points since November 1998. 7 The stock of M4 had fallen by £4.2 billion (-0.5%) in June. Although one-off factors had distorted M4 flows in May and June, the underlying growth rate had been weak in both months.  The growth rate of M4 in the year to June had been 5.6%, its lowest since March 1995.  In contrast, aggregate M4 lending (excluding securitisations) had been strong in June, rising by £9.6 billion (1.0%), its highest flow since February 1998.  The twelve-month growth rate of M4 lending had risen to 7.7% in June, from 6.8% in May.  The excess of M4 lending over M4 deposits had been financed predominantly by non-residents. 8 The twelve-month growth rate of household sector M4 deposits had risen to 6.8% in Q2, a pickup of 1 percentage point since 1998 Q2.  Household M4 lending had also strengthened in Q2, rising by £3.7 billion (0.7%) in June and by an average of  £3.6 billion a month (0.7%) during the quarter.  The twelve-month growth rate had picked up from 6.9% in 1998 Q2 to 8.0% in  1999 Q2;  stronger secured lending had more than accounted for this rise.  The flow of total net secured lending to individuals had picked up in June to £3.0 billion (0.6%), and the twelve-month growth rate of net secured lending had reached 6.8% in June, compared with 5.6% a year earlier.  The value of loan approvals for house purchase in June was also strong at £10.6 billion.  Total unsecured lending had continued to slow during Q2, the  twelve-month growth rate falling to 14.4% in June, down from its late 1998 peaks.  However, the June flow itself had been strong, with a one-month increase in lending of 1.2%. 9 PNFCs’ M4 deposits had been weak in Q2, with an average monthly flow of £0.2 billion (0.2%).  Similarly, sterling lending by banks and building societies to PNFCs had also been weak in Q2, with a flow of only £0.1 billion in June and an average monthly flow of £0.3 billion (0.2%), leading to its lowest quarterly growth rate since 1997 Q1.  However, PNFCs’ total borrowing—including funds raised on the capital markets and foreign currency borrowing—had been extremely strong in Q2 at £18.3 billion, the highest flow in real terms since 1989 Q3. l0 Other financial corporations’ (OFCs’) M4 deposits had fallen again in Q2, the twelve-month growth rate coming down to 1.1%, its lowest value since 1993 Q2.  By contrast, OFCs’ M4 lending (excluding securitisations) had risen strongly in Q2, the monthly flow averaging £2.1 billion (1.1%).  The twelve-month growth rate of OFCs’ lending had risen to 10.3% in 1999 Q2, fully reversing the decline in the growth rate observed for Q1. 11 Turning to price indicators of monetary conditions, interest rate expectations implied by 2000/2001 short sterling futures contracts had risen by about 50–60 basis points since the previous MPC meeting.  The release of the MPC minutes on 21 July, the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony by the Federal Reserve Chairman on Annex:  Summary of data presented by Bank staff  Inflation Report:  November 1999 68 22 July, and the mid-month fall in sterling were all thought to have contributed. 12 Nominal forward rates at maturities of three to five years had changed little in the month.  Long rates had fallen, but this fall was believed to be related to the lack of liquidity in the long (30-year) end of the gilt market, rather than to economic fundamentals. l3 Interest rates implied by short sterling futures had exhibited a ‘hump’ in May which became more pronounced in June and July. This hump suggested that in July the market had been expecting UK short-term interest rates to rise in 2000 and 2001, and to be at around 6.5% in late 2002. l4 Real interest rates derived from the index-linked gilt market had been virtually unchanged since the previous meeting. Likewise, survey measures of inflation expectations for 1999 and 2000 were hardly changed in July compared with June.  On the other hand, market expectations of inflation in the short to medium term (derived from a comparison of nominal and index-linked gilts, and based on 3 and 5 year bond rates) had risen, continuing an increase since the beginning of the year. l5 The Bank’s survey of advertised retail interest rates had suggested that the 25 basis point cut in the repo rate in June had not yet been fully passed through to standard variable mortgage rates. Fixed-rate mortgages in July had continued to rise;  average  five-year fixed mortgage rates (with no lock-in) had risen by about 20 basis points to around 6.4%. l6 The FTSE All-Share index had fallen by 4.5% since the previous meeting.  The fall had been widespread, with the decline in utilities stock prices being especially large.  Small capitalisation stocks continued to outperform the FTSE 100, rising by 0.1% in value since the previous meeting. l7 The sterling effective index had fallen by 1.2% since the May meeting to 103.3, approximately 0.2% below the modal path of the May Inflation Report.  Since the July meeting sterling had fallen by 1.1% against the euro and risen by 4.0% against the dollar.  Movements in sterling over the month had appeared to be largely unrelated to changes in UK yields relative to overseas. III Demand and output l8 There had been changes to the level and composition of GDP arising from the annual balancing exercise.  The cumulative impact of these revisions had been to raise the level of the output measure of GDP by less than 1/4% by 1999 Q1;  the levels of the expenditure and income measures of GDP had been revised up by around 1/2%. So the average measure of GDP at constant market prices had been revised up by 0.4%.  The revisions had resulted in a flatter and stronger profile for quarterly GDP growth over the first three quarters of 1998 relative to previous estimates. l9 Most of the upward revision to the expenditure measure had come from consumption and investment.  The level of household consumption had been revised up by 0.9% reflecting the results of the 1998 retail sales enquiry.  Investment had been revised up by 2.4% reflecting more computer spending.  These revisions had been partly offset by downward revisions to the level of government consumption, reflecting new estimates of spending outside the health and education sectors.  The cumulative revision to stocks had been small.  Similarly, the contribution of net trade since 1996 had been slightly more negative than on previous estimates, but the difference was not large. 20 There had been a significant upward revision to profits in 1997 and 1998.  Average profits during 1998 had been around 4% (0.9% of GDP) higher than previous estimates.  But the profile of declining profits over 1998 and in 1999 Q1 had remained.  Turning to the output measure, the level of manufacturing output had been revised up by 0.4%.  The level of services output had been revised up by 0.1% and construction output had been revised down. 21 GDP growth at constant market prices in 1999 Q1 had been revised up to 0.1% from zero mainly because of a less negative contribution from net trade.  The revision to growth at basic prices had been slightly larger to 0.2% from zero—reflecting a less sharp fall in the output of the energy supply sectors.  The preliminary estimate for Q2 had shown GDP growth at constant market prices picking up to 0.5%.  The annual rate had been unchanged at 1.2%. Output of the service sectors had grown by 0.5% and, within this, distribution and retailing output had grown by 0.4%.  The annual rate of services output growth had slowed to 2.4% from 2.7%. 22 Industrial production had risen by 0.1% in June because of higher energy output.  By contrast, manufacturing output had fallen by 0.2%;  but it had risen by 0.4% over Q2 as a whole, following three consecutive quarterly declines. 23 Retail sales volumes had been flat in June, following a rise of 1.1% in May.  The level of sales C had been revised up in April and May so that quarterly growth in Q2 had been similar to Q1, at 0.9% compared to 1.0%.  Food stores had continued to report slower sales growth than other stores;  sales were, respectively, 0.2% and 1.5% higher in the three months to June compared with the previous three months.  According to the CBI distributive trades survey, the balance of retailers reporting a rise in annual sales growth in July had risen to +28 from +22—its highest level since February 1998. 24 The GfK measure of consumer confidence had declined in July to 2.4 from 5.8 in June, which had largely unwound the sharp rise in confidence in May.  Both general and household-specific measures of confidence had fallen.  A new quarterly survey by the Consumers Association had also shown a small fall in consumer confidence to +33 in July from +35 in April. 25 New information on house price inflation had been mixed. The Nationwide index had risen by 0.4% in July, which had reduced the annual rate of house price inflation to 6.9% from 7.5%. The Halifax index had shown a sharper rise on the month of 2.2%, which had increased the annual rate to 8.2% from 6.9%.  The number of housing transactions had continued to rise.  The growth rate of particulars delivered had been 3.8% in the three months to June compared with the previous three months and the number of loans approved—a leading indicator of transactions—had been 7.5% over the same period.  Net reservations for new homes had continued to rise, with the balance rising to +33 in June from +24 in May, though official data had suggested that increased demand had yet to feed through to housing starts. 26 Monthly trade data had pointed to a stronger net trade position, consistent with the continued upward trend in survey indicators of export demand.  Goods exports to non-EU countries had risen by 5.0% in Q2, compared with a fall of 1.9% in Ql.  The recovery had been widespread, with exports rising to both the United States and the Asian countries.  Exports to EU countries had continued to be weak, falling by 1.3% in the three months to May. 27 Survey evidence for Q3 had pointed to a continued recovery in manufacturing output and a pickup in services output growth. The July Confederation of British Industry (CBI) survey had shown a further improvement in total and export orders, though the balances had remained negative at -19 and -24 respectively. Business optimism had risen to +5 from -6, the first positive reading since October 1998 and well above the average since 1972 of -5.  The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) survey had shown both manufacturing and services orders and sales picking up in Q2;  domestic service orders had risen to +19 from +15.  The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) output balances in the manufacturing and service sector had been above the no-change level of 50 for the fourth and fifth month running in  Monetary Policy Committee 69 July.  The CIPS construction activity index had declined slightly in July, to 62.9 from 63.7, but had remained well above 50. IV The labour market 28 According to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), employment growth had slowed since the second half of 1998, increasing by just 20,000 in the three months to May.  The employment rate had fallen by 0.1 percentage points to 73.9%, as growth in the  working-age population had outstripped growth in employment. Employment growth in the three months to May had been more than accounted for by full-timers;  part-time employment had fallen, although it was still 90,000 higher than a year earlier.  Total hours worked had been unchanged in the latest three months:  the small rise in employment was offset by a 0.1% fall in average hours worked. 29 Turning to survey data, after seasonal adjustment, the July CIPS survey had reported employment in manufacturing falling at around the same rate as in June, while employment growth in the services and construction sectors had increased slightly.  The BCC survey had pointed to an improvement in employment intentions in Q3 for both manufacturing and services, while the CBI had reported an upturn in manufacturing employment intentions, though the balance remained negative. 30 The CBI Industrial Trends survey reported a slight increase in skill shortages in Q2, though they had remained below their historical average.  The net balance of manufacturers reporting shortages of unskilled labour had picked up to its highest level since 1974.  The BCC had also reported continued recruitment difficulties. 31 Job-centre vacancy data had recently been affected by a number of distortions, and the ONS had recommended looking at notifications rather than the stock of vacancies.  But on both measures, vacancies had been broadly flat in June.  This contrasted with the NTC Press advertising index, which had been falling for several months. 32 Claimant unemployment had fallen by 0.1 percentage points in June to 4.4%, the lowest rate since 1980;  LFS unemployment had fallen by 36,000 in the three months to May, compared with the previous three months, taking the rate down to 6.2%.  Both unemployment rates had been broadly flat since the middle of 1998. The recent fall in LFS unemployment had been broadly concentrated among those unemployed for under one year, a reversal of previous rises.  LFS redundancies in spring 1999 had been around the same rate as a year earlier.  Redundancy rates  had remained highest in the manufacturing and construction industries. 33 Revisions to GDP data had led to large upward revisions to productivity growth in recent quarters.  Annual productivity growth in 1999 Q1 had been revised up from 0.5% to 1.0%.  And the Institute of Management Services productivity index pointed to a sharp pick-up in Q2. 34 Whole-economy headline average earnings growth, which is a three-month moving average of monthly outturns, had declined further in May to 4.3%, while private sector earnings growth had fallen by 0.5 percentage points to 4.2%.  Turning to the individual monthly outturns, whole-economy earnings growth had been revised up to 4.0% in April and was unchanged in May.  Recent upward revisions to the Reward index had brought it more into line with the Average Earnings Index (AEI).  The latest data indicated a 0.2 percentage point fall in June to 3.6%.  The Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services (FRES) surveys on temporary and permanent pay rates were among the few indicators pointing to rising earnings growth:  both series had increased slightly in July. 35 Growth in ONS wages and salaries per head, at 5.4%, had been higher than the 4.8% reported by the ABI in Q1.  It was thought that the difference could largely be accounted for by differences between the industrial weights used for wages and salaries and for the ABI, and by reconciliation of the GDP income data with the expenditure and output data.  The real product wage and the real consumption wage had both grown strongly in Ql. 36 The National Minimum Wage (NMW) had been introduced on 1 April.  The spring LFS, which covered responses between March and May, had shown a muted impact of the NMW on the distribution of earnings.  But there could be several explanations for this.  First, many responses would have been made in March, before the introduction of the NMW, and of those responding in April or May, many people may have been reporting pay for a period before 1 April.  Second, the LFS was known to under-record hourly earnings.  It was still too early to draw firm conclusions about its impact on earnings;  this would not be possible until publication of the summer LFS and the 1999 New Earnings Survey in October. 37 The method of weighting used in the Bank’s settlements database had been changed.  In the past, settlements had been weighted together using the employment weights of the Bank’s sample.  Now, in addition to being employment weighted, the four main sectors of the database were weighted together using fixed sectoral weights from the 1996 Annual Employment Survey.  This had reduced the weight placed on the public and construction sectors, which had both been overweight in the Bank’s sample, and increased the weight on private services. 38 The twelve-month whole-economy settlement for June, calculated on the new basis, had been 3.6% for the sixth month in a row.  Within that total, higher public settlements had been offset by lower private sector settlements.  Three-month private sector settlements had increased to 3.4% in June, mainly because of a large construction sector settlement in August covering 600,000 employees. V Prices 39 The Bank’s index of commodity prices excluding oil had risen by 0.7% in June;  the index including oil prices had increased by 0.8%.  Both series had now shown positive annual inflation for three consecutive months.  Other measures of commodity prices had continued to show negative but moderating annual inflation. 40 The oil price had risen sharply again in July.  The rise had brought the one-month future price of Brent crude to $19.38 on  28 July, 80% above its trough in December 1998.  Producer price inflation had increased in June, total input prices by 0.6% (annual inflation had risen to -0.8%) and total output prices by 0.2% (1.0%).  Excluding food, beverages, tobacco and petroleum, both series had remained markedly lower:  annual inflation on those measures had been -4.2% and -0.5% respectively in June. 41 The terms of trade had increased steadily since its most recent trough in 1995;  the National Accounts revisions had made little difference.  Manufacturers’ margins for exports had continued to fall over the past year but domestic margins had been broadly flat.  Retailers’ margins had fallen during the winter, but had increased during the second quarter, to a level similar to that a year earlier.  The retail sales deflator had fallen in June, on both an annual and a monthly basis.  Annual inflation had been revised up to zero in May, which had meant that June’s fall had been the first on record.  Revisions to the GDP deflator had lowered the annual inflation rate in the first quarter.  The new estimates had shown a sharp fall in annual GDP deflator inflation between Q3 and Q4 1998.  But the level of the deflator by 1999 Ql was very similar to the previous estimates. 42 The annual rate of RPIX inflation had risen by  0.1 percentage points to 2.2% in June.  The rate excluding taxes and  Inflation Report:  November 1999 70 excise duties (RPIY) and the all-items rate of inflation (RPI) had both remained unchanged in June, at 1.5% and 1.3% respectively. Ofwat, the water industry regulator, had announced proposed cuts in water prices, due to start in April 2000.  Most of the fall would occur in the first year, which if it were passed on in full would lower RPIX inflation by 0.2 percentage points for a year.  The short-term outlook for RPIX inflation was that it would remain close to 2.2%/2.3% for the next few months.  That had represented a slight increase in expectations, primarily due to higher petrol and house prices. VI Reports by the Bank’s Agents 43 The Bank’s regional Agents reported on the pace of the recovery based on discussions with their contacts over the past month.  There had been a further pick up in manufacturing orders and output in July.  But the path of recovery in domestic demand had not been smooth, and had varied between the regions and between industries.  Exports to some markets had picked up, particularly to the US and Asian markets.  But the strength of sterling and the level of import penetration had continued to be perceived as a problem.  Manufacturing firms had expected a stronger recovery in the second half of this year.  Services output had continued to grow steadily.  Within the service sector, retailing output had been a little stronger and IT, financial and businesses output had been quite buoyant. 44 Consumer demand had picked up, but not strongly.  There had been a slow recovery in retail sales, helped by early Summer sales and the opening of new shopping centres.  The strength of the housing market did not seem to be feeding through into increased demand for goods related to house moves, at least not yet.  Car sales had been reported to be rather sluggish.  Overall, consumer demand had not been as firm as recent official data had suggested. 45 There had been further easing in the labour market. Employment in the manufacturing and primary sectors had continued to contract, but had expanded further in the service sector.  Skill shortages had eased, though there had been pockets of tightness in some sectors.  There had also been some reports of quality problems at the bottom end of the skills distribution.  Firms had continued to focus on improving productivity. 46 The Bank’s Agents presented a survey on productivity growth which they had carried out over the previous month.  Of the 157 firms in the sample, nearly half had reported that their productivity growth over the past year had been above normal, compared with 20% who had reported growth below normal. Responses on future productivity growth had been more positive, with just 7% expecting productivity growth to be below normal. Reasons for expected improvements included the more efficient utilisation of the workforce during the economic upturn and new capital investment coming online.  One possible explanation for the contrast between the relative weakness of official statistics on productivity and the more upbeat picture of the survey could have been a form of aggregation bias:  firms who had contracted out services such as cleaning might have reported the same gross output produced by fewer employees, and hence a rise in productivity.  But if aggregate output and employment were unchanged, then aggregate productivity would not have been affected by such a move.  Asked about spare labour capacity, the most common response—cited by nearly 40% of firms—had  been that only zero to 1% of employees were currently underutilised.  However, a quarter of manufacturing firms reported that 6% or more of the workforce were surplus relative to their current output. VII Market intelligence 47 Market expectations for UK interest rates in both the short and the long term had risen since the previous MPC meeting and the market now seemed confident that 5% would form the floor  for official interest rates.  Economists’ views of future interest  rates had, in contrast, been lower than those implied by short sterling futures—for example, the latest monthly poll by Reuters showed a lower path for interest rates than that implied by the futures market.  It was possible that some large transactions had produced overshooting in markets that may have been seasonally thin. 48 In the foreign exchange market, the main development over the month had been the across-the-board weakening of the US dollar:  there had, in contrast, been relatively little sterling-specific market comment.  The dollar had weakened against the yen on what the market saw as a change in the Bank of Japan’s policy on intervention.  It had also weakened against the euro, initially, according to market commentators, as short positions were closed out, with some subsequent support at the higher levels from stronger-than-expected economic data for the euro area.  More recently, the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony and the renewed probability of rising US interest rates had affected both US asset markets and the dollar.  Data from options markets suggested that the market saw the balance of risk on the downside for sterling against the euro but not against the dollar.  Monetary Policy Committee 71 1 Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee reviewed the world economy, monetary and financial conditions, demand and output, the labour market, and prices and costs. The world economy 2 The Committee discussed whether recent news might cause an upward revision to the projections for world activity and prices. In the United States, domestic demand was still strong, but had started to slow.  Indeed, it was possible that US growth would be lower than assumed in the August Inflation Report projections. There were signs in the non-farm payroll data of slower employment growth.  Final domestic demand had, however, slowed less sharply.  There were also some signs of incipient inflationary pressures:  some commodity prices had risen, hourly compensation had accelerated and there had been a pick-up in producer prices. The Federal Reserve had recently raised official interest rates by 0.25%. 3 Some of the activity data for the euro area were perhaps a little stronger than had been expected a month ago.  They supported the strengthening recovery built into the forecast.  4 In Japan, there was evidence of a sharp fall in corporate investment in the second quarter.  Despite this weakness, which was thought likely to be reflected in the forthcoming Q2 GDP release, other forecasters’ projections for Japanese GDP growth in 1999 continued to be revised up.  There was also a perception that the authorities would take further fiscal action if needed—as an insurance policy if the recovery faltered.  There were signs that deflationary pressures might be easing—the rate of change of the core CPI was essentially flat. 5 The recovery in the rest of Asia had been stronger than had previously been expected, and activity in Brazil and Russia somewhat less weak;  though offset to some extent by events in some smaller South American countries.  But the environment continued to be fragile, with interest rate spreads remaining at high levels. 6 One question was whether the likely pattern of trade balances in the major industrial countries would give rise to significant exchange rate movements.  For example, would the growing US trade deficit lead to a depreciation of the dollar?  It  was possible that the markets might test the level of the yen  against the dollar, with the yen rising and possibly taking the euro with it.  Since one of the factors behind the recovery in confidence and activity in the euro area had been the depreciation of the exchange rate, such a move might risk a weaker outlook for the euro area.  This in turn would have implications for the United Kingdom, though it would depend in part on what happened to sterling if the dollar depreciated against the yen and the euro.  But the link between trade accounts and exchange rates was far from automatic. 7 The Committee noted that other forecasters’ projections for world activity had generally continued to be revised up over the past few months, bringing them broadly into line with the Committee’s August Inflation Report projections.  Although the recent data might not point to a significantly stronger outlook for world activity than assumed in August, there were now signs that gave the Committee greater confidence in its projection of a robust recovery in world activity.  Monetary and financial conditions 8 Broad money growth was now at its lowest since 1993.  This was largely accounted for by falls in other financial corporations’ (OFC) deposits, rather than changes to money holdings of households or non-financial corporations.  The fall in money holdings of other financial corporations was also reflected in a fall in their bank borrowing—both sides of the balance sheet were shrinking.  However, the sector was heterogeneous and there seemed to be no single explanation.  Although there might be lags, the adjustment did not seem well correlated with a possible reduction in the appetite for risk following the events of last summer and autumn.  Another possibility was that the recent falls in deposits were in part a reaction to heavy borrowing through bond markets in advance of the Millennium.  In any event, the rapid rise in these deposits and loans in earlier years had been difficult to explain.  Overall, the changes to OFC money balances were not well understood and warranted continued investigation.  As in the past, the Committee judged that developments in OFC money holdings were likely to have little impact on inflation.  As well as focusing on growth in non-OFC money, it was noted that Divisia money continued to grow at around 7%. 9 Narrow money had been growing at around 8%, and this seemed somewhat faster than could be explained entirely by earlier reductions in interest rates.  The question was whether the signs were of faster growth than thought a month ago.  Recent money growth probably presaged faster growth in consumer spending over the next few months, or was at least consistent with the pace of consumer spending growth that had already been seen.   10 Household credit growth had been strong, with short-run growth rates exceeding 8% on an annual basis.  Estimates of mortgage equity withdrawal in Q2 were the highest since Q2 1991, but were considerably below the levels of the late 1980s.  House prices had risen sharply again in August, and the annual rate of increase was now nearly 10% on both the Halifax and Nationwide measures.  Although there remained many regional differences, it was no longer correct to describe the rise as being accounted for by a few isolated hot spots.  It was difficult to estimate exactly how much the previous reductions in interest rates had fed through to house prices—some rise was to be expected despite the forthcoming abolition of tax relief on mortgage interest payments. For the recent rise in house prices to be accounted for by lower interest rates, people would need to have focused primarily on recent movements in short-term interest rates. 11 It was possible that the transmission mechanism was faster than previously thought, and that the recent rise in house prices simply reflected a more rapid adjustment to a new level following previous reductions in interest rates.  But if it were not faster, then it was likely that there was more to come from previous reductions in interest rates, and that other factors had been responsible for the current rapid rate of increase.  For example, employment had continued to grow—and with it labour income—and consumer confidence had increased. 12 The current level of the house price to average earnings ratio was only slightly above its long term average.  Financial liberalisation probably raised the level of house prices through the 1980s, while the reduction in mortgage interest relief since the  mid-1980s might have somewhat reduced the level of house prices. It was possible that the fall in the average level of nominal interest rates in recent years would, over time, lead to a rise in the house price to average earnings ratio.  So it was difficult to know what the Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 7–8 September 1999  Inflation Report:  November 1999 72 equilibrium house price to earnings ratio should be.  Of more concern than the current level of house prices was the recent rate of increase.  If the current rate of increase continued, the ratio would soon be well above the profile assumed in the August Inflation Report.  There was also uncertainty about the size of the effect on domestic demand associated with the current strength of house prices and activity.  As measured by indicators such as particulars delivered, activity was now stronger than at any time since the early 1990s.  There remained a big stock of, as yet unused, mortgage approvals.  Although the current state of the housing market was not like that reached in the late 1980s, the recent indicators meant that the Committee’s concern about the possible implications for inflation of housing market developments was rising.   13 Turning to other financial prices, the gilt yield curve was now sharply downward sloping at maturities of five years and beyond.  It was likely that the level of long term interest rates partly reflected the effects of the minimum funding requirement.  The sterling effective exchange rate index was very close to its level at the time of the August meeting. Demand and output 14 GDP growth had been unchanged from the preliminary estimate in Q2, at 0.5%.  A breakdown of the expenditure components had now become available.  Final domestic demand growth had turned out somewhat stronger than expected in the Inflation Report central projection.  This was largely accounted for by stronger consumption growth.  Part of this strength might be explained by the change in practice concerning new car registration dates this year, but the strength in consumption seemed more widespread than this.  The latest indicators seemed to suggest that strong consumption growth had continued into the third quarter. 15 One possible explanation for stronger consumption was that there had been deeper than expected price discounting, reflecting the previous slowdown in activity after last summer.  This might lead to an increase in the level of real consumption, but it did not necessarily imply that strong consumption growth would continue. There was, however, little direct evidence of deeper than expected discounting, although this would be consistent with the weaker than expected outturns for RPIX and the retail sales deflator.  However, it was possible that as the economy recovered any such discounting would be reversed.  In that case the time profile of profit margins would be a little different from what had been expected in August, so there would be only a temporarily depressing effect on inflation. There was little direct evidence available on the behaviour of profit margins across the economy, so it was particularly difficult to distinguish between these two possibilities.   16 Inventories had made a much larger negative contribution to GDP growth than had been expected a month ago.  That seemed consistent with the stronger outturn for consumption, and might indicate an involuntary reduction in stocks.  However, the survey data from the CBI and CIPS had shown few signs of a substantial involuntary reduction.  If the reduction in inventories had been in response to stronger than expected consumer demand, then the implication might be stronger demand and output growth through the second half of the year than assumed in the central projection of the August Inflation Report.  Although there was uncertainty about the appropriate level of the stock-output ratio, it seemed likely that the larger than expected negative contribution in Q2 reduced the risk of significant destocking in the future. 17 Although consumption had turned out stronger than expected, this had been offset to some extent by weaker investment. Public sector investment was continuing to undershoot spending plans, although this should be made up either later this year or in future years and in any event was a fairly small percentage of total investment.  Most of the investment weakness was in private business investment, especially in the manufacturing and distribution sectors.  There was a possibility of a Millennium-related slowdown in investment growth and the Bank’s regional Agents had found some evidence of a ‘Millennium pause’ in IT-related investment.  18 Net trade had made a slightly stronger contribution to Q2 growth than had been expected at the time of the August meeting. This reflected weaker than expected imports and somewhat stronger exports.  It was difficult to read too much into these figures given their volatility from quarter to quarter.   19 Surveys seemed to be pointing to a slight rise in the quarterly growth rate of GDP in the third quarter, which was consistent with the central projection in the August Inflation Report.  But the current annualised rate of growth of final domestic demand of around 41/2% was unsustainable.  It was noted, however, that the growth of nominal domestic demand had, slowed in recent quarters. At some point final domestic demand would have to moderate to allow room for an improvement in the external environment feeding through to net trade.  Labour market 20 Employment growth had continued to slow, but unemployment was still falling.  The Labour Force Survey measure of unemployment had now reached its lowest rate since the series started, at 6.0%, while the claimant count had fallen to its lowest level since 1980.  The FRES survey pointed to increasing shortages of permanent and temporary staff in August.  The Bank’s regional Agents had also noted tightness returning even in some lower skilled areas.  But not all the quantity indicators pointed to greater tightness.  It was noted that there had been a reversal in the path of inactivity, which had risen in Q2. 21 The latest earnings figures had been difficult to interpret. The Average Earnings Index (AEI) had shown a marked pick up to 5.2% in June compared with 4.1% in May and 4.0% in April, with the three-month headline rate consequently at 4.4% in June.  The latest outturn for the AEI meant that earnings growth had turned out somewhat higher than the starting point used in the August inflation projections.  That need have little consequence for inflation looking forward, unless the recent outturn affected the view of the future profile for earnings.  It was noted that the Committee’s best collective judgment of the central projection for earnings growth made at the time of the August Inflation Report was now towards the bottom end of the range of other forecasters. 22 It was difficult to know what was the underlying trend in earnings growth.  The higher June figure was influenced by bonuses.  But the change in the ONS form for the reporting of bonuses earlier this year meant that an unaffected year-on-year comparison would not be available until early next year.  By contrast with the AEI, the Reward index had shown earnings growth continuing to slow.  Settlements also continued to fall gently on the twelve-month employment-weighted measure, to around 31/2% in July.  However, after allowing for changes in inflation expectations, real settlements and earnings growth had probably continued to increase. Prices and costs 23 Turning to prices and costs, some input prices were now moderately stronger, while output and retail prices remained weak. RPIX, for the fourth consecutive month, had been below the target.  24 The Brent oil price had averaged over $20 per barrel in August, and was well above $21 by the time of the meeting.  That compared with an assumption of $17 for the price over the next two years, which was the best collective judgment in the August Inflation Report, although some members had opted for a higher assumption of $19 in August.  The forward price was somewhat below the spot price, but had continued to be well above $17. However, the forward price had not typically been a good predictor  Monetary Policy Committee 73 of the future spot price.  If the oil price remained at its current level it would imply higher retail prices than incorporated in the August projections.  25 The Bank’s commodity price index had recently been reweighted and this had led to a slight reduction in the level of the index.  The reweighted index, like the old, showed an increase in commodity prices over recent months.  Commodity prices rose again in July on both the aggregate and non-oil indices. 26 Manufacturing input prices were now rising in annual terms for the first time since 1996, as the downward pressure from sterling’s past appreciation and falling world commodity prices had largely worn off.  Manufacturing output prices had also been rising gently, but were still falling after stripping out food, beverages, tobacco and petroleum.  The rate of increase of the GDP deflator had turned out at historically low levels in Q2, at 1.5%.  Retail price inflation excluding mortgage interest payments had been constant at 2.2% in July, a little below the rate in the central projection.  The headline inflation rate had fallen further to 1.3%, its lowest rate since 1993.  These recent low inflation outturns could have some effect on inflation expectations going forward, but it was unclear how much or how long-lasting they would be.  27 There was a risk that commodity prices might turn out higher than assumed a month ago if world demand strengthened and if the rise in the oil price was sustained.  In addition, some of the unexpected weakness in retail price inflation over the past few months had been accounted for by seasonal food prices, which were hard to predict.  However, the prospect of increasing competition, for example in food retailing, might work to reduce the price level. There were also prospective regulatory effects in the water and electricity industries.  Overall, there seemed no strong reasons for changing the general shape of the short-term saucer-shaped projection for inflation made at the time of the August meeting.  Other considerations 28 There had been some discussion outside the Bank of whether, in the run-up to the end of the year, concern about Y2K problems would impose a constraint on monetary policy authorities adjusting interest rates.  This debate seemed to be more widespread in the press than in the financial markets, whose main focus remained on the provision of liquidity.  The Committee could see no reason why this should constrain UK monetary policy setting, and monetary policy would continue to be set, on the basis of the news from month to month, with a view to achieving the inflation target. 29 The Committee noted that the markets were attaching a low probability to a change in interest rates this month.  In that context, the Committee discussed the pros and cons of moving interest rates by less than 25 basis points.  Smaller changes might signal, in appropriate circumstances, the Committee’s concern with the outlook for inflation, but with less of an effect on the exchange rate. Continuing the practice of changing interest rates in units of 25 basis points might make it increasingly difficult ever to change that practice.  But a smaller change in interest rates might be seen as excessive fine-tuning.  Markets might also expect that a further move in interest rates would follow such a small change. The immediate policy decision 30 In focusing on the data it was difficult to see many indicators, at least on the output side, that were not generally stronger than they appeared a month ago.  The question was the extent to which these data affected members’ forecasts and how they judged the relationship between output and inflation in the medium term.  31 Some members preferred no change in interest rates this month.  In August they had favoured a lower central projection than the best collective judgment shown in the Inflation Report fan chart.  On one view, there had been little news since then to alter this judgment.  The international situation was developing much as expected, though perhaps a bit weaker in the US and stronger in Japan.  UK output growth was recovering, but was still growing below trend, investment was weak and manufacturing output had not even recovered to its level of a year ago.  Furthermore, RPIX remained below target and broader price measures such as the deflators for retail prices, for consumption and for GDP were all lower than expectations or recent history.  This supported the view that competitive pressures on prices and margins were exerting a stronger downward pressure on inflation, even during conditions of robust domestic demand, than in the past.  The recent rise in house prices was unlikely to develop into the type of consumption boom seen in the late 1980s, given the overheated position of the economy then and the stimulus to housing from financial liberalisation and fiscal changes.  On this view to raise interest rates now would be premature, and could have adverse effects on the exchange rate and thus damage the recovery in growth that was necessary to return inflation to target. 32 A second view among those favouring no change this month was that the news on the month had probably shifted the central projection up a little towards August’s best collective judgment, primarily because of stronger labour market data and the change in tone of the Agents’ reports.  The risks of higher inflation from the effect of the strong housing market on domestic demand had also increased.  But against this there was an argument that sterling might be stronger than assumed in August.  The possibility of growth surprises in the UK relative to overseas might now imply some additional upward risk to sterling, even relative to the random walk convention.  Business confidence was still fragile.  A rate rise would probably be associated with a larger-than-normal appreciation of sterling.  It would therefore be preferable to wait to give growth a chance to get established.  In recent years, the US had experienced high rates of GDP growth and a significant rate of appreciation in the stock market, without it yet leading to the higher CPI inflation that might have been expected from standard historical relationships.  It might therefore be inappropriate to assume that the higher GDP growth and increase in house prices that we were seeing in the UK would necessarily lead to as much of an increase in RPIX inflation as was predicted by historical relationships.  The saucer-shaped inflation projection, and the fact that forward-looking indicators of output prices were still benign, allowed time to see how the activity-price relationship was evolving before contemplating any action. 33 A majority of members favoured an increase in interest rates of 25 basis points this month, although one of them saw some attractions in a smaller increase.  Various arguments were identified for a rise.  Since the August meeting, new data showed that the pace of final domestic demand growth in 1999 Q2 was faster than expected.  The current pace of final domestic demand growth could not be sustained indefinitely, and action would be needed to restrain that growth in order to meet the inflation target in the medium term. Consumption growth, together with the fall in inventories, probably indicated faster demand and output growth than previously expected in the second half of the year.  The recent strength of the housing market and associated credit data were reasons to believe that consumption growth would remain strong.  Growth in narrow money had continued to pick up and the labour market had continued to tighten, with the tone of reports from the Agents on conditions in the labour market reflecting this.  Real wages had continued to grow increasingly strongly on most measures.  It was recognised that an increase in interest rates now carried some risks. It might damage consumer and business confidence.  Given that there was little expectation of an interest rate rise in the markets, there could be a further appreciation of sterling, which would tend to depress further activity in the tradable sectors of the economy. The saucer-shaped projection for inflation provided some time to see how some of the puzzles about the short-run trade-off between nominal and real variables might be resolved.  But there was an  Inflation Report:  November 1999 74 argument for an early increase in interest rates because there  was merit in seeking to adjust expectations now rather than later, when more might otherwise need to be done to have the same  effect in slowing domestic demand in order to achieve the inflation target. 34 Of those Committee members favouring an increase, some had taken the view in August that prospective inflation was likely to be somewhat stronger than the profile in the Inflation Report fan chart.  The news over the past month—including developments in the oil price, consumer demand, the housing market and the labour market—had together further strengthened the medium-term inflation outlook.  In the absence of compelling tactical considerations to the contrary, these members shared the view that a 25 basis point increase in interest rates was needed now to keep prospective inflation in line with the target. 35 The Governor invited members of the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate be increased by 25 basis points to 5.25%.  Seven members of the Committee (the Governor, Mervyn King, David Clementi, Willem Buiter, Charles Goodhart, Ian Plenderleith and John Vickers) voted for the proposition. DeAnne Julius and Sushil Wadhwani voted against, preferring to maintain interest rates at 5.0%. 36 The following members were present: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers Sushil Wadhwani 37 Gus O’Donnell was present as the Treasury representative.  Monetary Policy Committee 75 1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by the Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee on 3 September, in advance of its meeting on 7–8 September 1999.  At the start of the Committee meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and that information is included in the Annex. I The international economy 2 The US outlook had remained robust, despite a slowdown in GDP growth in Q2.  Forward-looking indicators for the euro area had picked up, and there were signs of a more stable outlook in Japan.  Growth projections for Asia and Brazil had been revised upward. 3 In the United States, the Federal Open Market Committee had raised both the federal funds target rate and the discount rate by 25 basis points, to 5.25% and 4.75% respectively on 24 August, but had maintained a neutral stance on the outlook for policy in the near term.  The preliminary estimate of quarterly GDP growth in Q2 had been revised down to 0.4%, though final domestic demand growth had remained robust, as reflected by a further widening of the trade deficit in June.  The three-month on three-month growth rate of retail sales had fallen to 1.5% in July, and consumer confidence had fallen in August, though it remained strong.  The outlook for industrial activity had improved, with both production and durable goods orders strengthening and industrial confidence remaining robust.  The business inventories to sales ratio had fallen to an historically low level.  Quantities data had suggested that the labour market remained tight, but evidence of rising labour cost pressures had been mixed.  In Q2, hourly labour compensation growth had risen, and productivity growth had fallen.  Annual average hourly earnings growth had fallen in August.  Consumer price inflation had remained subdued, though there had been some evidence of higher pressures on producer prices. 4 French preliminary GDP had risen by 0.6% in Q2.  Industrial production data had pointed to weak GDP growth in Q2 in Germany and Italy.  But industrial confidence in the euro area had risen in July, with the west German IFO index rising for the third consecutive month.  In both Germany and Italy, domestic orders had been recovering, and foreign orders had improved.  And, for the euro area as a whole, export expectations had risen.  Euro-area consumer confidence had rebounded in July, reflecting an improvement in expectations of the future general economic situation.  Annual M3 growth had remained not far from the European Central Bank’s reference value of 4.5%.  Credit growth had moderated somewhat but remained strong, rising at an average twelve-month growth rate of 10.5% during May to July.  Euro-area consumer price inflation had risen to 1.1% in July from 0.9% in June, mainly due to food and energy price rises.  5 Japanese economic data had, for the most part, been weak during the month, though the outlook appeared to be stabilising. The Ministry of International Trade and Investment’s GDP proxy measure had fallen by 0.4% in Q2 after a 1.3% rise in Q1 (the official measure of GDP had risen by 2.0% in Q1, after a  0.1 percentage point upwards revision).  The Ministry of Finance’s capital spending survey had shown a 13.4% fall in corporate investment on a year earlier in Q2.  Construction orders by both the private and public sector had weakened.  Consumer confidence had fallen in Q2, though it remained higher than in 1998.  Household spending had risen by 0.7% in July, but this had failed to reverse the 2.3% decline in June.  The outlook for consumption remained constrained by continued falls in employment.  Inventory levels had fallen to their lowest level since 1991, suggesting that inventory adjustment might be nearing completion, and increasing the likelihood that industrial production would rise in Q3.  There had been evidence that deflationary forces might be diminishing:  base money growth had risen, and the annual rate of domestic wholesale price deflation had fallen. 6 In the financial markets, the yen had appreciated over the month, by around 3% against the dollar and 5% against the euro. The Nikkei-225 index had been little changed over the month, despite continued net foreign purchases of Japanese assets.  In contrast, equity prices had increased in the euro area.  US bond yields had been little changed over the month.  Swap spreads (and to a lesser extent corporate spreads) over Treasury bond yields had risen in recent months, though it seemed likely that at least part of this rise reflected factors other than a rise in perceived credit risk. Spreads on government bonds in emerging markets had been little changed since the August MPC meeting.   II Monetary and financial conditions 7 Narrow money growth had remained robust.  The  twelve-month growth rate of notes and coin, after adjusting for the introduction of the new 50 pence and £2 coins, had risen to 7.7% in August.  The three-month and six-month annualised growth rates had remained high, at 8.2% and 8.0% respectively. 8 M4 had fallen by £3.3 billion (0.4%) in July, and the annual rate of growth had slowed to 3.6%, its lowest since October 1993. M4 lending (excluding securitisations) had also been weak in July, with the annual rate of growth falling to 6.6%.  The slowdown in both M4 and M4 lending had mainly been accounted for by other financial corporations (OFCs), though private non-financial corporations’ (PNFCs) M4 deposits and borrowing had also been weak.  OFCs’ M4 deposits had fallen by £6.3 billion in July and the annual rate of growth had become negative (-5.6%) for the first time since 1992 Q1.  Lending to OFCs had also fallen sharply in July, by £3.3 billion (1.7%).  PNFCs’ M4 deposits had fallen by  £0.1 billion (0.1%) in July, and lending to PNFCs had fallen by  £0.1 billion.  However, while PNFCs had repaid sterling bank borrowing in each of the last three months, their total borrowing, including capital issues and foreign currency borrowing as well as domestic currency borrowing from banks, had increased in 1999 relative to 1998. 9 The M4 deposits of the household sector had risen by  £3.1 billion (0.6%) in July, and M4 lending to households (excluding securitisations) had risen by £4.3 billion (0.8%).  The annual growth rate of M4 lending to households had risen to 8.2%, its highest rate since 1991 Q4.  This had reflected the strength both of the housing market and of total lending for consumption (defined as unsecured lending plus mortgage equity withdrawal).  The monthly flow of total lending secured on dwellings had risen to £3.4 billion, compared with an average of £2.8 billion in the first half of 1999.  Monthly consumer credit growth had been 1.2% in July, resulting in an increase of 14.5% on a year earlier.  According to provisional Bank estimates, mortgage equity withdrawal had increased sharply in Q2 to around £2.5 billion from £0.8 billion in Q1.  On the basis of these estimates, total lending for consumption had been the largest in real terms since 1990 Q1. 10 Interest rate expectations implied by longer-dated  short-sterling futures contracts had fallen by around 10 basis points since the previous MPC meeting, though they had been volatile over the month.  Medium and longer-term nominal forward rates had risen by around 10–25 basis points. 11 UK swap spreads had risen in August.  The ten-year swap spread had risen to around 0.9 percentage points, close to its highest Annex:  Summary of data presented by Bank staff  Inflation Report:  November 1999 76 rate since October 1998.  However, corporate bond spreads had increased only marginally and were well below October 1998 levels. 12 Real interest rates derived from the index-linked gilt market had risen by around 25 basis points since the previous MPC meeting, to just over 2%.  A measure of the expected real interest rate in the year 2000, constructed using the Merrill Lynch survey of fund managers’ inflation expectations, had risen by 40 basis points, to 3.8%, between the beginning of July and the beginning of August.  Survey-based measures of inflation expectations had been broadly unchanged in August. 13 The FTSE All-Share index had risen by 1.5%, to 2975, since the August MPC meeting.  Small-capitalisation stocks had continued to outperform the FTSE 100.  The sterling effective index had fallen by 0.1% since the August MPC meeting, to 103.2. Sterling had fallen by 1.0% against the dollar and had risen by 0.6% against the euro. III Demand and output 14 Quarterly GDP growth at constant market prices had been unrevised, at 0.5% in Q2.  The annual growth rate had also been unchanged at 1.2%.  15 Manufacturing output had grown by 0.3% in Q2, the first rise since 1998 Q2, but the level of output had still been more than 1% lower than a year earlier, and had fallen by 0.2% in June. Construction output had grown by 0.7% in Q2, but had still only been 0.5% above its level a year earlier.  The weakness of the official construction data relative to the strength of the survey evidence had been a puzzle.  Services output had grown by 0.4% in Q2, revised down from 0.5% in the first release, with annual growth at 2.3%, the lowest rate since 1992 Q4.  Within services, the output of the distribution, hotel and catering, and business and finance sectors had been weak.  But there had been continuing strength in transport and communications, mainly due to telecommunications. 16 The expenditure breakdown of GDP had shown domestic demand growing by 0.3% in Q2, but changes in inventories had reduced growth by 0.8 percentage points.  Growth in final domestic demand had been strong at 1%.  17 Consumers’ expenditure had grown by 1.3% in 1999 Q2, and annual growth had been 4%.  Consumer confidence had risen further in Q2, and income and wealth had been robust.  A breakdown of consumption growth had not yet been published, but retail sales had grown by 0.9% in Q2, and utilities output had risen by 1.4%.  Within retail sales, household goods had been the fastest growing sector, possibly related to the pick-up in housing activity. The data had appeared to suggest a rise in the demand for cars, but caution was required because the pattern of spending on cars had been heavily affected by the changes to registration dates.  New private car registrations had increased by 21% in Q2 on a year earlier.  The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders had said that demand had been stronger than expected so far in 1999, partly stimulated by deals and incentives, but they still expected registrations for 1999 as a whole to be similar to those in 1998. 18 Total investment had grown by 0.4% in Q2.  Business investment had fallen by 0.7%, but had remained 10.1% higher than a year earlier.  Within this, manufacturing investment had fallen by 4.2% and service sector investment had fallen by 0.3%. The corporate operating surplus had risen by 1.3% in Q2, but had fallen by 9.5% on a year earlier. 19 Including the alignment adjustment, inventories had fallen by £1.8 billion in Q2, led by manufacturing and other industries.  It had not been clear whether the decline in manufacturing stocks had been voluntary.  The 1998 H2 rise in stocks had been more than unwound in 1999 H1.  The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) quarterly survey in July had indicated a fall in stocks, with a balance of -20 reporting a rise in finished goods stocks, the lowest since 1991 Q4.  The CBI monthly survey had reported that stocks were still more than adequate. 20 Net trade had contributed 0.2 percentage points to GDP growth in Q2, the first positive contribution since 1997 Q3.  Total exports had grown by 0.6%.  The 1.1% rise in exports of goods had been more than accounted for by growth in exports to non-EU countries;  exports to the EU had fallen by 1.2%.  UK imports of goods and services had fallen by 0.2% in Q2, despite the strength of final domestic demand. 21 Turning to indicators of Q3 activity, manufacturing output had risen by 0.3% in July and retail sales volumes had risen by 0.1%.  On a slightly longer view, retail sales growth appeared to be above trend.  Retail sales had growth by 1.3% on the three months to July compared with the previous three months, and 2.9% compared with a year earlier.  There had been far less of an upturn in retail sales values, which may have accounted for the more downbeat retail sentiment and the more subdued picture from the Agents.  The CBI Distributive Trades survey had shown a balance of +33 respondents reporting higher growth in August, and the outlook for September had been for further growth.  The GfK consumer confidence index had increased in August to +4.9, but the MORI measure of confidence (which was more volatile and had a smaller sample) had fallen to -12. 22 House prices had risen strongly in August, with the Halifax measure rising by 1.1%, and the Nationwide measure by 2.5%. Housing activity had also continued to recover.  Particulars delivered had risen by 5.8% in July and had been 11.3% up on a year earlier, to the highest level since September 1992 (but still well below the level of the late 1980s).  The July House Builders’ Federation survey had shown a net balance of +37 respondents reporting an increase in net reservations, and the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors sales balance had remained high at +31.  Loan approvals data had been flat in the three months to July compared to the previous three months, but remained at a high level.  Private housing starts had risen by 4% in July, but had fallen by 2% on a year earlier. 23 Survey balances of manufacturing investment intentions had remained well below their average levels.  The CBI Industrial Trends survey had shown output expectations balances up to +17, the highest level since October 1997.  Orders had been around their average, at –22, but well below 1997 levels, and export order books had remained weak at –37.  The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) manufacturing survey had shown continued growth in output, with the index at 57.2 in August.  The survey had also shown modest growth in export orders, with the index at 52.6. The CIPS services survey had remained strong, at 57.3 in August, with financial services strongest, but computing and IT weaker. The CIPS construction index had also been strong at 60.8, with housing and commercial orders rising.  Construction new orders had shown slight growth over the latest three months (0.6%), but had been 2.6% below their level in the same period in 1998. IV The labour market 24 Employment growth had continued to slow.  According to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), employment had grown by 43,000 (0.2%) in Q2, compared with Q1.  This increase had been more than accounted for by a rise in full-time employment.  The total number of hours worked had increased by 0.2% between Q1 and Q2, but average hours worked per person in Q2 had still been 0.7% lower than a year earlier. 25 The August CIPS surveys had suggested that the rate of decline of manufacturing employment had slowed, but that employment growth in services and construction had eased slightly.  Monetary Policy Committee 77 The Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services (FRES) survey had indicated increasing shortages of permanent and temporary staff in August.  But the latest reports by the Bank’s regional Agents had suggested little overall change in labour and skill shortages.  The stock of Jobcentre vacancies (adjusted for recent data problems) had remained broadly flat in July. 26 Both official measures of unemployment had fallen.  LFS unemployment had decreased by 62,000 in Q2, and the rate had fallen to 6.0%, the lowest since the series started in 1984.  The fall had been largely accounted for by lower short-term unemployment; long-term unemployment had remained broadly flat.  The claimant count unemployment rate had fallen from 4.4% in June to 4.3% in July. 27 Labour market inactivity had risen by 58,000 in Q2, about half of which had reflected an increase in the number of people who said that they did not want a job.  In an accounting sense, employment growth had been associated with falling inactivity over the past year or so.  But in Q2, inactivity had risen, associated with falling unemployment.  Recent movements in inactivity had been hard to explain in terms of economic factors. 28 Whole-economy headline average earnings growth, a  three-month moving average, had risen to 4.4% in June.  The twelve-month growth rate of earnings had risen sharply, to 5.2% in June, from a revised 4.1% in May and 4.0% in April, as private service sector earnings had increased markedly.  The upturn between April and June had been affected by bonus payments. First, slower earnings growth in April and May 1999 had been to some extent the counterpart of unusually large bonuses in April and May 1998.  Second, earnings growth in June had been boosted by bonuses paid by firms in the telecommunications sector, some of which had been paid in different months in previous years.  A smoothed measure of earnings growth, generated using a statistical filter, had been 4.7% in June, although the profile of this measure tended to be sensitive to the arrival of new data. 29 The August FRES survey had indicated a further rise in the earnings growth of permanent staff supplied by job agencies.  But earnings growth as measured by the Reward index had fallen further in July.  The Bank measure of twelve-month  whole-economy settlements had been falling since the end of 1998, and had reached 3.5% in July.  The three-month whole-economy measure had been relatively stable, at 3.2%, but service sector settlements had continued to fall.  Other published measures had been somewhat lower than the Bank’s in recent months, but some of these differences could be explained by the fact that outside measures were not employment-weighted.  In contrast to nominal measures of settlements, estimates of the real value of settlements had been increasing. V Prices 30 The oil price had continued to rise.  The one-month future price of Brent crude oil had reached $21 at the end of August, over 100% higher than in December 1998.  The average price in August had been about 9% higher than in July.  Recent price rises had been driven by OPEC supply cuts, though stronger world demand had also been a factor.  The Consensus Economics forecast was for prices to fall from these levels over the following months.  In the past, oil price rises had normally been passed on quickly and fully to both output and retail petroleum prices.  31 Excluding oil, there had been little change in the underlying picture for commodity prices.  The Bank’s index of commodity prices including oil had risen by 4.5% in the year to July; excluding oil, it had fallen by 2.7%.  The index had been reweighted to reflect the pattern of UK demand in 1995.  This has brought down the growth rates slightly in recent months, but overall had made little difference to the profile.  Metals prices had increased markedly over the month.   32 Producer input prices had risen sharply in July, by 3.4% compared with June, mainly due to oil prices, but also because of higher imported material prices.  Annual input price inflation had become positive for the first time since 1996.  Annual output price inflation had risen to 1.1%.  The rise in output prices since the beginning of the year had been more than accounted for by rising petroleum product prices (reflecting both oil price and duty effects). Annual output price inflation excluding food, tobacco, beverages and petrol had remained negative.  The CBI Industrial Trends survey had suggested that output price inflation would remain muted in the near future. 33 The GDP deflator had increased by 1.5% in the year to  Q2, its second lowest annual rate of increase since 1963.  The annual inflation rate of household expenditure, which accounted  for close to two thirds of GDP, had continued to slow, as had inflation in the domestic demand deflator.  Both the import and export deflators had risen in the second quarter, but the annual inflation rates had remained negative.  The retail sales deflator  had been unchanged in July, on both a month and a year earlier. The RPIX and GDP-based measures of domestically generated inflation had fallen in the second quarter, to 3.6% and 1.7% respectively. 34 RPIX inflation had remained unchanged at 2.2% in July. RPIY inflation had increased slightly to 1.6%.  HICP inflation  had fallen by 0.1 percentage points to 1.3%.  Insurance and  tobacco prices had made the largest positive contributions to  the change in RPIX inflation;  household goods, housing depreciation and food prices had made the largest negative contributions. VI Reports by the Bank’s regional Agents 35 The Bank’s regional Agents reported that, overall, the pace of recovery had been gathering some speed, but the picture had remained uneven, both sectorally and geographically.  The  recovery had appeared to be stronger in the south of England. Agriculture had remained weak.  Growth in manufacturing output had been positive, but varied from sector to sector.  IT and communications-related output had shown the strongest growth; most other sectors had recorded only modest growth.  Construction output had remained at a high level, although in some areas, growth appeared to have levelled off.  Demand for housing had been rising in the south of England and in pockets elsewhere.  Business and professional services activity had been strong.  Overall, consumer demand had continued to grow steadily.  The retail picture had been mixed:  discount stores had continued to record stronger growth than department stores.  Firms had reported that the worst had passed in overseas markets, although import competition had remained a problem.  Order levels had improved as world demand had picked up. 36 There had been evidence that, after a slight easing, labour markets in some areas had begun to tighten again.  In parts of the South East and London, the demand for labour remained high.  Any renewed pressure had not yet shown through in pay, although there was an expectation of higher settlements in the future.  Recent wage settlements had been, on the whole, lower than a year ago, at around 2%–3% for manufacturing and 3%–5% for services.   There had been some pay freezes, but also some significantly higher rises. 37 Input prices had generally flattened out, although there had been evidence of increasing raw materials prices of metals and oil. There had been little change in manufacturing output prices.  By contrast, upward pressure on services prices had remained noticeable at the higher value-added end.  Retail price inflation had stayed low, kept down by competition and consumer spending behaviour.  House prices had been rising, particularly sharply in areas such as London and the South East.   Inflation Report:  November 1999 78 VII Market intelligence 38 Short-term market interest rates had fallen a little since the August MPC meeting.  But there had been larger intra-month movements, mainly reflecting US data releases and the publication of the Inflation Report and the minutes of the August MPC meeting.  Rates implied by short sterling futures had continued to exceed those implied by surveys of economists’ forecasts, but many fewer economists now expected any further reduction in official rates.  And evidence from options suggested, if anything, an upside rather than a downside risk to market interest rates over the next year or so.  Two main views of the likely future path of official interest rates had been expressed in the market, with one expecting a rise in rates this year and the other expecting no rise until next year, if at all.  Particular issues highlighted had included the housing market, the divergence of the paths of real and nominal wages, the composition of GDP, and the expected future path of interest rates in the United States and the euro area.  Implied volatilities on short sterling futures had fallen on the days of publication of the Inflation Report and the minutes of the August MPC meeting. 39 Movements in sterling over the month had been relatively small.  Although some domestic data releases had differed from market expectations, these appeared to have had little influence on the exchange rate.  Implied volatilities had been slightly higher than a month earlier.  Survey projections for sterling against the euro had again suggested a higher degree of sterling depreciation than implied by the UIP path, based on relative interest rate differentials. But survey projections for sterling against the dollar had been broadly in line with the UIP path.  Particular factors identified by market participants as influencing the prospects for sterling had included relative growth and monetary policy developments in the major economies, the UK trade figures and the volume of mergers and acquisitions flows.  40 Bank staff explained that over the next few months the Bank’s stock of refinancing was forecast to grow, reflecting the normal seasonal increase in the market’s need for liquidity and the Millennium change.  The Bank intended to introduce a temporary three month repo facility to supplement the usual two week operation.  This facility had no significance for monetary policy. Any change by MPC in the official rate would result in a matching adjustment to the rate charged on outstanding three month repos.  Monetary Policy Committee 79 The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee today voted to raise the Bank’s repo rate by 0.25% to 5.25%. The Committee reviewed developments since its last meeting, including world demand, the strength of consumption and the housing market, and continuing tight conditions in the labour market.  Although inflation is expected to remain below the target of 21/2% in the short term, the Committee concluded that a rise in interest rates was necessary to keep inflation on track further ahead, and that an early move could lower the level at which interest rates might otherwise need to be set.  It therefore voted to increase the repo rate by 0.25% to 5.25%. The minutes of the meeting will be published at 9.30 am on Wednesday 22 September. Text of Bank of England press notice of 8 September 1999 Bank of England raises interest rates by 0.25% to 5.25%  Inflation Report:  November 1999 80 Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 6–7 October 1999 1 Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed the world economy;  money and credit; demand and output;  the labour market;  and prices and costs. The world economy 2 In the United States final domestic demand was still growing strongly, although GDP growth in Q2 had slowed to below 1/2%, reflecting negative contributions from net trade and stockbuilding. Headline consumer price inflation was increasing, reflecting higher oil prices. 3 There had been little market reaction to the tightening of US monetary policy in August, although equity prices had fallen slightly in recent weeks.  While this could be consistent with a soft landing for the US economy, it need not be so, particularly if the current account deficit continued to grow as a result of strong domestic demand, or if forward-looking indicators of price pressures continued to rise.  The prospects for sustainable growth would be improved if supply-side changes, such as a rise in productivity, continued to underpin the increase in output in the US, and led to inflows of capital from the rest of the world. Nevertheless risks remained of a sharp move in the dollar and/or in equity prices if these supply-side factors should tail off.  At its October meeting the FOMC had left rates unchanged, but with a bias towards a possible firming of policy going forward.  The Committee agreed that although there were still risks to the outlook for the US economy, it was not clear that these were any greater than they had been a month earlier. 4 In Japan output had been stronger in Q2 than expected, although it was too soon to say whether this upturn would be sustained.  A fiscal package now looked likely, and statements by the Bank of Japan had indicated that monetary policy would remain accommodative.  But over the past month there had been a strong appreciation in the yen which, if sustained, could weaken future growth prospects.   5 In the euro area, business confidence was now back to its long-term average, with Q2 GDP growth positive in most countries other than Germany.  Orders data also pointed to a recovery.  Broad money growth was above its reference value, although doubts remained about the quality of these data, subject as they were to revision.  The recovery was still in its early stages, and had yet to become firmly established. 6 Prospects in the emerging market economies were on balance little changed from a month earlier.  If anything, forecasts were now a little less negative for Russia and Brazil, although not for the rest of Latin America.  In many Asian countries growth was strong, if much as expected. 7 While the uncertainties about the prospects for the world economy had diminished over the past few months, and recent data suggested a stronger recovery in world trade, the Committee concluded that there had been little change in the outlook since its previous meeting. Money and credit 8 Recent data for the monetary aggregates had been volatile, and it was unclear whether the latest figures contained much in the way of significant information.  In September M0 was virtually unchanged from a month earlier, and as a result the annual growth rate had fallen to 7.0% from 7.8% in August.  In August M4 had grown in underlying terms for the first time since April, with the annual growth rate a little higher at 4.3%.  The growth in August primarily reflected movements in the deposits of Other Financial Corporations;  deposits by Private Non-Financial Corporations had fallen. 9 Household credit growth in the year to August, and estimates of mortgage equity withdrawal in real terms in Q2, were both at their highest levels since 1991 Q4, although the latter had been revised down slightly.  While it was too soon to draw conclusions from the various house price indices, there was now some suggestion that the hype surrounding the housing market had moderated. 10 Nominal interest rates implied by futures contracts for the next nine months were some 40 basis points higher than a month earlier, with rates higher across most of the yield curve, although at around two years the implied rates were little changed.  Towards the end of September these rates had been lower than at the time of the Committee’s previous meeting, but there was little sign yet that by moving in September the Committee had achieved any lasting reduction in interest rate expectations further along the yield curve. On a longer-term basis, two-year real interest rates, calculated using survey-based measures of inflation expectations, had risen by 60–90 basis points over the past quarter.  Swap rates for maturities of three years or more were generally 20–30 basis points higher over the month as a whole, with gilt yields up by rather more. Equity indices had fallen by around 4% over the month, and the sterling effective exchange rate had appreciated by 2%.  The magnitude of the rise in medium-term interest rates and the exchange rate over the month as a whole was higher than might normally be expected from a rise in the repo rate of 25 basis points. This might have reflected market perceptions of a turning point in interest rates, and it was possible that there had also been other influences, for example higher European interest rates and  M&A-related activity in the exchange markets.  Whatever the cause, these movements over the past month would tend to restrain demand. Demand and output 11 Real quarterly GDP growth was now stronger than earlier estimated, at 0.2% in Q1 and 0.6% in Q2, and on a year-on-year basis had picked up from its low point of 1.3% in Q1. Manufacturing output had increased by 0.4% both in July and August, and the National Institute for Economic and Social Research now projected GDP growth of 0.8% in Q3. 12 During the past month, household expenditure had been revised up in Q1, in part due to new estimates for expenditure on cars.  But with the level of household expenditure little changed in Q2, the quarterly growth rate had been revised down to 1.1%. Business investment had been revised up to 0.8% in Q2, though government investment had fallen by 5%.  Final domestic demand therefore continued to grow strongly, although by less than in the previous quarter.  Domestic demand itself was much less buoyant, reflecting a sharp fall in inventories, especially in manufacturing. The difference between growth in final domestic demand in Q2 (at 4.5% on a year earlier) and GDP (at 1.4%) had been the highest since the first quarter of 1988. 13 Although the current account deficit had widened in Q2, in volume terms the net trade contribution to quarterly GDP growth had been positive.  While these were volatile numbers, the most recent trade data suggested that the stronger export performance in Q2 might have continued into the third quarter, on account of stronger world trade.  Manufacturing export orders, as measured by  Monetary Policy Committee 81 the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS), had also risen in Q3 and many of the contacts of the Bank’s regional  Agents had reported some recovery in overseas orders.  A strengthening in exports relative to domestic demand would lead to a better-balanced recovery. 14 Indications for domestic demand in Q3 remained strong, judging by the retail sales data, the CBI Distributive Trades Survey, and reports from the Bank’s regional Agents, but the GfK consumer confidence measure had fallen back in September and the CIPS services survey, while remaining well above 50, was also slightly lower.  Measures of industrial confidence about profitability had strengthened, although the effects of the recent appreciation of sterling were unlikely to have fed through to survey data yet.  Car registration data and evidence from the Bank’s regional Agents suggested that activity in this sector may have slowed in Q3, although the data were still hard to interpret given the changes in the registration cycle for new vehicles and survey evidence was mixed.  Tax revenues appeared to be buoyant, perhaps largely reflecting cyclical factors. 15 Taken together, the evidence suggested slightly stronger output growth than had been expected the previous month,  and perhaps a rather stronger export performance.  Some Committee members saw a few signs that domestic demand  growth could perhaps be moderating, as it would need to do at some point if growth were to prove sustainable, although a period of above-trend growth was to be expected in the recovery phase of the cycle. Labour market 16 Employment growth was no longer slowing, with an increase of more than 50,000 on the latest three month Labour Force Survey (LFS) measure, and around 100,000 in Q2 on the more volatile Workforce jobs measure.  The LFS unemployment rate continued to fall, reaching 5.9% in the three months to July, and the claimant count rate was down to 4.2%.  Measures of labour market inactivity had meanwhile risen. 17 The Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services reported that shortages of temporary and permanent staff persisted in September, and the Bank’s regional Agents spoke of a similar picture in most parts of the UK.  So far as skill shortages were concerned, it was important to distinguish between cyclical  effects and structural issues relating to education and training.  It was also possible that skill shortages might now lead to less generalised pressure on earnings than in the past, given the increasing importance of individually-tailored contracts.  But some of the Agents’ contacts reported labour shortages even for unskilled jobs. 18 These skill shortages did not yet appear to be influencing pay settlements, which continued to fall.  The recently announced electricians’ settlement was a possible exception, but it appeared to have consolidated certain existing supplementary payments so that the net settlement might have been rather less than had been reported.  Earnings growth, as measured by the Average Earnings Index, had meanwhile fallen to 4.4% in the year to July, from 5.2% in the previous month.  The headline rate, a less volatile measure calculated as a three-month moving average, had risen slightly to 4.6%. 19 Real earnings growth had increased, and might suggest  that pressures in the labour market were greater than implied by the path of nominal earnings.  But it might be that employers and employees had expected rather higher inflation when settlements were agreed, and to that extent had been surprised by the subsequent growth in real earnings.  How that would influence next spring’s pay bargaining round remained to be seen. Prices and costs 20 Input prices for manufacturing were rising, as a result of higher oil prices, and were 3.8% up on a year earlier.  However, output prices (excluding excise duties) were little changed.  Despite higher oil prices, RPIX inflation in the year to August had been a little lower than expected, at 2.1%, in part due to lower food prices. Within this total, goods price inflation was very low, and had turned negative on some measures, such as the retail sales deflator, while the prices of services continued to increase.  The implied deflator for GDP at market prices had been revised, with the annual rate of change at 1.8% in Q2.  Most measures of domestically generated inflation were falling, with the RPIX-based measure down to 3.6% in Q2 on a year earlier, compared with almost 5% only six months earlier. 21 It was possible that increasing competition in the retail sector, for instance in food and clothing, might reduce RPIX inflation further below target, at least in the short term.  But it was difficult to be sure how large any such effect might be.  Some types of price cut (such as ‘2 for 1’ offers) were not captured by the RPIX.  Others might be offset by increases in prices elsewhere, although the scope to do so would be limited if competition was indeed more intense, or if low and stable inflation made it easier for consumers to identify and react to relative price changes.  A survey by the Bank’s regional Agents had shown widespread discounting driven by new and existing competition, and consumer resistance to price rises.  Regulatory decisions (for example on utilities pricing) and rulings by competition authorities might add to the downwards pressure on inflation, although not all these factors were new: deregulation and competition had been important influences on pricing for many years, although more sectors currently might perhaps be affected than in recent years. 22 Even if competition were important in restraining price increases in the near term, what would be the effect on inflation further out?  To the extent that lower prices fed through into inflation expectations and wage bargaining negotiations next spring, the effects might persist beyond the short run.  But to the extent that some of the reductions in prices were time-limited (and perhaps analogous to advertising) there could be a bounceback in inflation further ahead as they unwound.  A further factor which might prolong downward pressure on prices was e-commerce. Both the short-run and longer-run effects of these various factors would need to be considered carefully in the context of the forthcoming Inflation Report forecast. 23 The Committee discussed the recent doubling in oil prices. In the short term, these increases would push up inflation, albeit from a position below target.  The Committee had to set policy so that prospective inflation further ahead was on target, so it would be important not to accommodate the longer-run effects from higher oil prices. The immediate policy decision 24 The Committee discussed various arguments for leaving the repo rate unchanged at 5.25%. 25 Final domestic demand was still growing rapidly, and was beginning to be reflected in stronger output growth;  growth in Q3 might be clearly above trend for the first time in two years, and output had been revised up for both Q1 and Q2.  There were signs—not least in survey data—that world trade in general, and UK exports in particular, might be recovering.  With stronger input prices and a tight labour market, there were upside risks to inflation in the medium term, although if the economy had fallen below potential after a period of below-trend growth, a period of  above-trend growth would be consistent with the inflation target. More immediately, there was a possibility that increased competition would result in greater downwards pressure on margins and prices, at least in the short term.    Inflation Report:  November 1999 82 26 Until recently, falling import prices had helped to restrain inflation, while output had been held back by a negative contribution from net trade.  Both of these influences might now be coming to an end, although much would depend on the future path of the exchange rate.  If domestic demand growth and domestically generated inflation fell back as net trade and import prices picked up, the economy should be better balanced going forward.  If not, pressure on resources—and inflationary pressures more generally— would increase. 27 The increase in the Bank’s repo rate at the Committee’s previous meeting had surprised the markets.  Compared with a month earlier, market interest rates were higher at most maturities, as were rates on fixed-rate mortgages, while sterling was stronger and equity prices lower.  While these developments might in part reflect influences other than the increase in official rates, if maintained they would help to restrain demand growth and inflation in the medium term. 28 There remained a number of puzzles, with most output and demand figures continuing to be stronger than expected, while inflation was if anything lower.  Similarly, in the labour market, despite a continuing fall in unemployment and reports of growing labour shortages there was as yet little sign of an acceleration in nominal earnings, although unit labour cost estimates were increasing quite rapidly.  The increase in real earnings growth might signal labour market pressures, but it could instead reflect lower than expected inflation.  It was unclear how long this combination of stronger growth with lower inflation would last;  it might reflect domestic developments, such as structural changes in product and labour markets, or alternatively external influences, which could prove temporary.  The change in market rates since the Committee’s previous meeting in September meant there was no need to move official rates now, although the Committee would remain alert to any signs that robust growth was feeding through into pressure on prices.   29 Some members of the Committee emphasised the likelihood that inflation, particularly in the short run, would fall further below target, in part reflecting the competitive pressures in retailing and regulatory developments in the utilities sector.  Nearly all inflation measures were at present falling;  RPIX had been below target for five months, and excluding petrol prices was running at only  1.7%.  Given the structural changes that may have occurred in the labour and product markets, it made sense to see whether higher growth would translate into as much of a rise in inflation as was suggested by historical relationships.  The rise in the repo rate had contributed to a significant tightening across the yield curve, and the impact of a stronger exchange rate had yet to be seen, even in survey data.   30 The Governor invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate be maintained at 5.25%.  The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the proposition. 31 The following members of the Committee were present: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers Sushil Wadhwani 32 Gus O’Donnell was present as the Treasury representative.  Monetary Policy Committee 83 1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee on 1 October, in advance of its meeting on 6–7 October 1999.  At the start of the Committee meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and that information is included in this Annex. I The international environment 2 The US economy had remained strong, and leading indicators for the euro area continued to indicate the prospect of faster growth.  Q2 GDP growth in Japan had been stronger than expected. 3 In the US economy strong personal consumption had accompanied further increases in household wealth.  New orders had been strong, especially in durable goods and manufacturing, in all Federal Reserve districts.  In the short run, some reversal of recent declines in inventories might support GDP growth. According to standard measures, labour cost pressures had not yet emerged, but more refined measures including the effect of stock options suggested some rise over the past few months.  Headline CPI inflation had increased to 2.3% in August due to higher crude oil prices, but core consumer price inflation (which excludes energy and food prices) had continued to slow. 4 GDP in the euro area was provisionally estimated to have risen by 0.3% in Q2.  GDP in Germany had been flat on the  quarter, but had risen by 0.4% in Italy.  Euro area HICP inflation had increased from 1.1% to 1.2% in August but, net of energy prices, had fallen again.  Confidence measures had shown  further improvement in economic conditions reported by  both consumers and producers, particularly in Germany and  France. 5 In Japan, GDP had risen by 0.2% in the second quarter. Industrial production had remained strong.  The September Tankan survey had shown an improvement in business confidence.  There had also been a pick-up in trade flows, in particular to South East Asia, where growth had been strong.  Prices of goods and services covered in the headline CPI had risen by 0.3% from July to August, a reversal in the recent trend.  This may have been accounted for by volatile food prices. 6 World commodity prices had increased, to a large extent accounted for by an increase in the price of crude oil, which seemed to have occurred because of a high degree of compliance with the agreement among OPEC members to limit supply.  The price per barrel had reached $24 at the end of September, up from $10 in December 1998.  The strength in oil prices had contributed to a rise in producer prices in the euro area and the US.  However, despite the strength in oil prices, producer prices in Japan had fallen further.  Food prices, by contrast, had moved to their lowest level since October 1992.  According to the Economist all-items index, non-oil commodities had declined by 5% in dollar terms over the year. 7 There had been a further appreciation of the Japanese yen in foreign exchange markets.  The extent of the yen’s appreciation against the euro and the dollar had been similar, and the bilateral euro-dollar rate had been broadly unaltered.  Equity markets around the world had fallen somewhat over the month.  One development had been the increase in buying intentions of US fund managers for euro-denominated equities as reported by Merrill Lynch’s Fund Manager Survey. II Monetary and financial conditions 8 Narrow money growth had slowed sharply in September. The twelve-month growth rate of notes and coin, after adjusting for the introduction of the new 50 pence and £2 coins, had fallen to 7.0% in September compared with 7.8% in August.  The one-month growth rate, at 0.0%, had been unusually low by recent historical standards.  The sharp reduction in the rate of monthly growth  was unlikely to have been solely ‘noise’, and might indicate that  the underlying growth rate was less than had been previously thought. 9 M4 had risen by £4.6 billion (0.6%) in August, with the annual growth rate rising to 4.3%.  After adjusting for an unusual transaction that had affected the flows in May and June, this had been the first rise in M4 since April.  M4 lending (excluding the effects of securitisations) had been very strong in August, rising by £10.0 billion (1.1%), but recent flows had been erratic. 10 Households’ M4 lending had been strong in August, rising by £4.1 billion (0.7%), and the annual growth rate, at 8.3%, had been the highest since 1991 Q4.  The three and six-month rates, at 9.4% and 9.2%, were above the twelve-month rate.  Total lending to individuals, including banks, building societies and other lenders had fallen slightly on the previous month to £3.2 billion, but it remained strong compared with an average of £2.8 billion for the first half of 1998.  The value of new loans approved for house purchase in August was £10.3 billion, little changed from the July figure of £10.2 billion.  It appeared that outflows from the stock of approvals had been mostly due to flows into gross lending; cancellations remained flat.  Total unsecured lending had been strong in August, with the three, six and twelve-month annualised growth rates at 14.9%, 14.1% and 14.1% respectively.  Recent data had led to the provisional estimate of mortgage equity withdrawal in Q2 being revised down from £1.9 billion to £1.6 billion.  But mortgage equity withdrawal in Q2 was still estimated to have been stronger in real terms than at any point since 1991 Q4. Households’ M4 deposits had been weak in August, rising by  £0.9 billion (0.2%).  The twelve-month growth rate was 6.2%. 11 Private non-financial corporations (PNFCs) had repaid bank borrowing in each of the last four months and the twelve-month growth rate had fallen by 0.7 percentage points to 3.5% in August. But a wider measure of PNFCs’ borrowing (which also includes bond and equity issues) had been strong between January and August, averaging £4.4 billion, compared with an average of  £2.9 billion in 1998.  The August figure had been down by  £0.3 billion to £2.4 billion.  PNFCs’ M4 deposits had fallen by  £1.2 billion (1.0%) in August.  The twelve-month growth rate had fallen by 2.2 percentage points to 3.9%. 12 Other financial corporations’ (OFCs’) M4 deposits had risen by £5.0 billion (2.9%) in August, only the second monthly increase in 1999.  OFCs’ M4 lending had also risen sharply, by £6.1 billion (3.0%).  Repo and reverse repo transactions had been £1.1 billion and £1.4 billion (nsa) compared with -£2.7 billion and -£3.1 billion in August 1998. 13 Interest rate expectations out to June 2000 implied by  short-dated sterling futures contracts had increased by 25 basis points or more, after the 25 basis point increase in the official repo rate on 8 September.  Over the month, nominal forward rates implied by gilts had also risen at short to medium maturities.  Swap rates had risen by around 30 basis points, slightly less than the  40 basis point rise in gilts, resulting in a narrowing of swap spreads, except at the two-year maturity.  Yields on corporate bonds had Annex:  Summary of data presented by Bank staff  Inflation Report:  November 1999 84 risen by between 30 and 35 basis points at maturities of between five and ten years.  There had been less than complete pass-through of the official repo rate increase to an average of standard variable mortgage rates offered by banks and building societies, but many institutions had not yet announced how they intended to respond. The spread of five-year fixed-rate mortgages over swap rates of corresponding maturities had narrowed. 14 Real interest rates derived from the index-linked gilt market had been little affected by the official rate rise, so implied inflation expectations moved in line with gilt yields.  In contrast, short-term survey-based measures of inflation expectations had been little changed.  And survey-based real interest rates had increased by between 60 and 90 basis points between the Q2 and Q3 surveys of inflation expectations. 15 The sterling effective exchange rate index (ERI) had appreciated by 2.1% over the month.  Within this, sterling had appreciated by 2.0% against the euro, 3.1% against the dollar, and had been virtually unchanged against the yen.  Monetary news had appeared to account for a significant amount of the appreciation in sterling’s ERI.  The FTSE All-Share index had fallen by 4.1% over the month.  This fall had been broadly spread across the sectoral components of the index. III Demand and output  16 Quarterly GDP growth at constant market prices had been revised up by 0.1 percentage point in both the first and second quarters, to 0.2% in Q1 and 0.6% in Q2.  The growth rate in the year to the second quarter had been revised up to 1.4% from 1.3%. Domestic demand growth in the second quarter had been revised down on a quarterly basis to 0.2%, but up on an annual basis, reflecting upward revisions to the level in both the first and  second quarters.  But the lower growth had been outweighed  by the contribution to quarterly GDP growth made by net trade, which had been revised up to 0.5 percentage points, largely due  to stronger export growth and an upwardly revised trade deficit  in Q1. 17 Quarterly growth of household expenditure had been revised down to 1.1% in Q2, though the level in the second quarter had been essentially unchanged from the previous estimate.  Spending on durables had been the main driving force of consumption growth in the first half of 1999.  Roughly half the revision to the Q1 number had come from expenditure on cars (which had been significantly distorted by the introduction of the new registration month in March).  Expenditure on services had been weak in the second quarter, particularly spending on financial services, which had fallen by 5.1%.  Expenditure on investment (excluding net acquisitions of valuables) had been revised up slightly in the second quarter, but the composition of growth had changed more markedly.  Business investment had been revised up significantly, but government investment had fallen by 5%.  Government consumption expenditure had not been revised. 18 Final domestic demand growth had been much stronger than domestic demand growth, as the change in inventories had contributed -0.8 percentage points to quarterly GDP growth.  The change in inventories had been revised up in both of the first two quarters by the equivalent of 0.3% of GDP.  The rate of manufacturing destocking had been revised up in the second quarter, but the level of retailers’ stocks had increased again by £405 million.  The sharp fall in the level of inventories in the second quarter had been slightly larger when excluding the quarterly alignment adjustment.  The sum of the alignment adjustments on the expenditure measure in the first two quarters had been close to £400 million.  The alignment adjustment has to sum to zero in any calendar year, which implied that either there would be downward revisions to the first two quarters in subsequent releases, or it would be negative in the second half of the year. 19 The current account deficit had widened in Q2, and had been at its largest since 1990.  But the trade deficit had narrowed as export volumes had grown by 2.1%.  Growth in import volumes had been revised up to 0.5%.  The revision had made the data more plausible as the previous estimate of a fall in imports had been difficult to reconcile with the strength of domestic demand, especially durables spending. 20 The revision to the income data within the National Accounts had shown growth of post-tax income of 3.1%, greater than spending growth in Q2.  The strength had been partly due to very strong growth of dividend income following a fall in Q1.  The gross operating surplus of corporations had remained weak in the revisions. 21 On the output measure of GDP, services growth had been revised up in the second quarter to 0.6%.  Within services, communications growth had been strong and finance and business output growth had picked up after slow growth in the previous two quarters.  Construction growth had been revised up in both the first and second quarters, to 0.5% and 0.6% respectively. 22 Retail sales volume growth had remained stronger than values growth in August.  Volume growth in the year to August  had been 3.6% compared with values growth of 3.2%.  The  official data had been consistent with information from the  Bank’s regional Agents.  The CBI distributive trades survey had suggested that growth would continue to strengthen, despite a small fall in the level of consumer confidence, as measured by the GfK survey. 23 The Nationwide measure of house price inflation had risen to 11.0% in September, compared with a figure of 9.8% in August. However, the Halifax measure had fallen from an annual growth rate of 9.4% in August to 8.8% for September.  The strong growth of house prices generally over the past year had not brought the level far from the long-run trend and, compared with incomes, the average house price had remained well below the recent peak in 1990.  Loan approvals growth had remained strong, as had survey evidence of housing strength. 24 Data on economic activity in the third quarter had remained strong in general.  Export volumes (excluding oil and erratics) had increased by 2.6% in the three months to July, with widespread growth on a geographical basis.  Imports had also been strong, rising by 3% over the same period.  Construction orders had fallen by 1.7% in the three months to July and by 5.9% compared with July 1998.  But the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) construction index had been 59.6 in September, indicating continued growth, though lower than in the summer.  Both the CIPS and CBI surveys had continued to show strengthening manufacturing output in September.  The CIPS services survey had remained well above 50, though it had fallen slightly for the second successive month.  The National Institute of Economic and Social Research’s estimate of GDP growth in the three months to September had been 0.8%, and had been produced after the publication of the August industrial production data. IV The labour market 25 LFS employment had increased by 54,000 (0.2%) in the three months to July, compared with the previous three months, broadly the same as growth in the three months to April. Workforce jobs had increased by 104,000 in Q2, though the series had been volatile and the average growth for H1 had been in line with LFS growth for the same period.  The rise in LFS employment had been split mainly between self-employment and employees, with employment growth broadly the same in both head-count and in full-time equivalent terms.  By industry, the recent rise in Workforce jobs had been concentrated in the services sector; employment had continued to fall in the manufacturing sector, though at a slightly slower pace.  The total number of hours worked  Monetary Policy Committee 85 had risen by 0.7% in the three months to July, and so average hours worked per person had increased by 0.5%. 26 The CIPS manufacturing survey for September had suggested a slowdown in the rate of decline of manufacturing employment.  In the construction sector, employment had expanded at a less rapid rate than in August, while services employment had grown at a slightly faster rate.  The Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services (FRES) survey had suggested that shortages of permanent and temporary staff had persisted in September.  The latest reports by the Bank’s regional Agents had suggested that skill shortages were a major concern in some areas. The stock of job centre vacancies (adjusted for recent data problems) and notifications of new vacancies had been broadly unchanged in August.  The National Press Recruitment Advertising index (produced by FRES) had stabilised. 27 Both measures of unemployment had fallen in the latest data release.  LFS unemployment had decreased by 86,000 in the three months to July compared with three months earlier, and the rate had fallen by 0.3 percentage points to 5.9%.  Claimant count unemployment had declined by 22,300 in August;  the rate had fallen by 0.1 percentage points to 4.2%, its lowest rate since  March 1980.  The latest fall in LFS unemployment had been mainly among the short-term unemployed, but long-term unemployment had also been lower. 28 Labour market inactivity had risen by 71,000 in the three months to July compared with the previous three months, with much of this increase accounted for by the number of people classified as not wanting a job.  The inactivity rate had increased by 0.1 percentage points to 21.2% in the three months to July. 29 Whole-economy headline earnings growth, a three-month moving average of the monthly annual rate, had increased from 4.4% to 4.6% in July, driven by a pick-up in private sector earnings. Service sector headline earnings growth had mirrored the increase in private sector earnings growth, rising to 5.0%, while manufacturing headline earnings growth had fallen back slightly to 3.4%.  The twelve-month growth rate of earnings had fallen back sharply from 5.2% in June to 4.4% in July.  The fall in the annual rate of earnings growth in July had been affected by bonus payments;  some firms in the telecommunications sector had paid bonuses in June, not in July as they had done in previous years.  A smoothed measure of earnings growth, generated using a statistical filter, had been 4.6% in July, though this measure was sensitive to new data.  The Committee were briefed about developments regarding the new Average Earnings Index sample. 30 Other earnings data had been mixed.  The Reward index had fallen from 3.4% in July to 3.3% in August.  The September FRES survey had indicated a further rise in earnings growth of temporary staff supplied by job agencies, though growth rates for permanent staff had eased slightly.  The measure of wages and salaries per head from the National Accounts had grown at an annual rate of 5.3% in Q2, which had been higher than the annual growth rate of the Average Earnings Index. 31 The Bank’s measures of wage settlements in August had been broadly unchanged from July.  The twelve-month  whole-economy mean had fallen since the end of 1998 but had been unchanged at 3.4% in August.  The three-month whole-economy measure had been relatively stable, at around 3.1%.  Other published settlements measures had been subdued in recent months. A range of measures had shown that the real value of settlements had been rising. 32 The ONS measure of annual productivity growth had fallen to 0.9% in Q2.  Productivity surveys for July and August which had been produced by NTC Research and the Institute of Management Services had suggested a sharp pick-up in productivity growth in Q3.  Growth in unit wage costs had risen again in Q2, as wages and salaries had grown faster than productivity. V Prices 33 The Bank’s oil-inclusive commodity price index had risen by 1.3% in August, mainly as a result of continued strengthening in crude oil prices.  Excluding oil, commodity prices had fallen slightly over the month, taking the annual inflation rate to -1.3%. This had been mainly accounted for by falling UK food prices. 34 Manufacturing input prices had risen by only 0.1% in August and were now 3.8% higher compared with a year earlier.  The latest CIPS survey input price index had risen to 54.6 in September, above the neutral 50 mark for the second consecutive month.  Output prices had also picked up.  The index excluding excise duties (PPIY) had recorded its first annual increase in two years.  But producer price inflation, excluding food, tobacco, beverages and petroleum, had remained subdued. 35 Both export and import prices had risen by 0.6% in July. However, after stripping out the oil component, export prices had fallen by more than import prices over the last 12 months. 36 The annual rate of change of the GDP and household expenditure deflator had been revised up to 1.8% and 1.5% respectively in Q2.  The weakness in the latter had been mainly accounted for by the steep fall in durable goods price inflation. 37 Retail price inflation in August had been below expectations. RPIX inflation had fallen to 2.1% mainly because of the weakness in food prices and by a less-than-expected seasonal bounceback in some other goods prices. VI Reports by the Bank’s Agents 38 The Bank’s regional Agents reported that overall there had been a continued pick-up in the pace of activity, driven by domestic demand.  But the regional divergences had widened.  The pick-up in growth had been most pronounced in the South, boosted by growth in services.  Manufacturing activity overall had increased at a moderate pace, but output in more specialist sectors such as pharmaceuticals and high-technology products had risen more quickly.  Construction activity had remained relatively robust across the regions.  Service sector growth had strengthened in a number of regions, with particularly strong demand for financial services.  Consumer demand had accelerated at different rates across the regions.  The retail picture had remained mixed, with discount stores continuing to record stronger growth than department stores.  The renewed appreciation of sterling had affected manufacturers’ margins further and contacts had reported that business was being lost to inward competition.  The agricultural sector had remained weak. 39 There had been evidence of further tightening in the labour market.  Most regions had reported skill shortages.  These had been more evident in services than in manufacturing and were quite acute in some sectors.  A significant number of contacts had reported that labour shortages had been spreading and affecting a wider range of skilled and unskilled jobs (particularly in the retail sector and financial services).  However, there had so far been little evidence of skill shortages affecting pay rates.  Firms reported that pay increases had been directed at performance-related pay rather than ‘across-the-board’ increases.  Many big manufacturers had contained overall increases in the pay bill, targeting increases at groups of staff and cutting staff costs elsewhere. 40 Commodity prices had begun to pick up for fuels, metals, paper and packaging.  However, firms had continued to find it difficult to pass on increased costs.  Contacts had reported that increases in fuel prices had not been passed through to output prices.  The Agents had conducted a survey of contacts in  Inflation Report:  November 1999 86 September to find out whether discounting in the retail and other service sectors had become more marked than in the past. Increased discounting had been notable in the food, mixed retailing, cars, and clothing and footwear sectors.  There had been little evidence of increases in discounting for services.  In those areas where discounting had increased, a number of explanations had been given for the pattern.  Existing and new competition were frequently cited for increasing the pressure on firms to discount prices.  Furthermore, a number of firms thought that consumers had become more sensitive to price differences within each sector, and had begun to bargain over price to an increasing extent. 41 Rising house price inflation had been most pronounced in the southern regions.  In the most recent month, reports of an acceleration in house prices had been more widespread, though some regions had not seen any pick-up in housing market activity. VII Market intelligence 42 In addition to the market view of short-term prospects, Bank staff looked at two key issues.  First, what factors had contributed to changes in the peak that interest rates implied by the short sterling futures curve were expected to reach;  and second, what had contributed to the rise in sterling over the month? 43 Looking at very short-term rates, mid-October two-week repo rates were expected to be higher than at present, suggesting a modest expectation of a rise in rates.  The Reuters’ poll of economists had shown a one in three chance of a 25 basis point rise in rates at the October meeting and a two in three chance of a  25 basis point rise before the end of the year. 44 Looking further out, implied short-term rates in the two-year area (where the short sterling curve had peaked earlier) had fallen over much of the month, but subsequently had returned to a level close to that prevailing before the September Monetary Policy Committee announcement.  Individual UK and international economic data releases had not appeared to explain all of this movement.  Bank staff considered whether equity prices had been an influence.  Falls in equity prices had appeared to reduce interest rate expectations, but more so in the United States than in the United Kingdom.  Bank staff had also considered that, at times, movements in sterling may have been a factor.  Finally, some market contacts had suggested that the fall in the two-year peak had been a continuation of the gradual adjustment to this summer’s earlier ‘overshoot’. 45 The sterling ERI had appreciated by 2.1% since the previous MPC meeting.  Risk reversals had suggested little change in  risk-hedging behaviour since the beginning of the year.  Weak US equities could have been a factor:  sterling had strengthened against the dollar during the period of global equity falls.  But it had been hard to say whether the dollar had fallen because US equities had weakened more than elsewhere, or whether it had been feared that they had further to go, or whether equities had been of greater significance in the US economy than elsewhere;  and the decline in US interest rate expectations which had accompanied weakening equity prices was one of the components of the monetary news. Market contacts had argued that, with hedge funds now less leveraged, ‘real money’ flows, including those from merger and acquisition activity, carried more weight in market movements. This could mean that such flows had a more persistent, though still temporary, effect on the exchange rate.

2000-02-17,"Inflation Report February 2000 The Inflation Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff  under the guidance of the members of the Monetary  Policy Committee.  It serves two purposes.  First,  its preparation provides a comprehensive and  forward-looking framework for discussion among MPC  members as an aid to our decision making.  Second, its  publication allows us to share our thinking and explain  the reasons for our decisions to those whom they affect. Although not every member will agree with every  assumption on which our projections are based, the fan  charts represent the MPC’s best collective judgment  about the most likely path for inflation and output, and the  uncertainties surrounding those central projections. This Report has been prepared and published by the  Bank of England in accordance with section 18 of the  Bank of England Act 1998.

Output in the final quarter of 1999 was 2.7% higher than a year earlier, while inflation remained slightly below the 21/2% target.  The growth of final domestic demand moderated during the year, but external demand picked up as world activity and trade strengthened.  Output growth resumed in manufacturing, but the outlook for net trade and for producers in internationally exposed sectors is affected by the strength of sterling.  The further rise in the exchange rate brings downward pressure on inflation in the near term. The labour market may have tightened a little in recent months.  Competitive and regulatory pressures on prices and margins are evident in some sectors, but their extent, duration and implications for overall inflation prospects are uncertain. The world economic outlook has improved further. Demand and output in the United States exceeded expectations throughout 1999, and the prospect is for continued expansion.  Activity in the euro area has picked up more rapidly than expected three months ago, and forward-looking indicators point to strengthening recovery.  However, the euro has declined and the sterling effective exchange rate has correspondingly risen.  There are few signs yet of self-sustaining domestic demand growth in Japan, but activity and trade flows in Asia have risen sharply, and prospects for emerging market economies have generally improved.  A number of commodity prices have risen since the autumn, the oil price to its highest level since 1991.  In view of the stronger outlook for demand and potentially for inflation, a number of central banks, including the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have tightened monetary policy since the New Year. Output in the UK economy is estimated to have grown by 0.8%—above trend—in both the third and fourth quarters of 1999.  Growth over the year was more balanced sectorally than for some time, though service sector output, which was 2.9% higher in Q4 than a year earlier, continues to grow faster than manufacturing output, which rose by 1.9% over the same period. Recent survey indicators and reports from the Bank’s regional Agents point to continuing firm output growth in the near term.  ii Inflation Report:  February 2000 The annual growth rate of final domestic demand, which was around 4% in the first half of 1999, appears to have eased somewhat.  Business investment slowed markedly, but this may partly reflect a ‘millennium pause’ in  IT-related spending.  And household expenditure on cars may have been depressed temporarily by expectations of price reductions.  However, rises in incomes, borrowing and wealth are likely to support firm household consumption going forward.  Inventory levels, which declined in the first half of 1999, subsequently picked up, perhaps in part for reasons relating to the turn of the millennium.   With the recovery in world trade, UK exports in the middle part of last year grew sharply—perhaps surprisingly so in view of the continued appreciation of sterling—and survey measures of export prospects have held up.  But the trade figures in recent months present  a weaker picture, and the high exchange rate—if maintained—is likely to lead to renewed deterioration in UK net trade. Narrow money growth has fallen back from an unusually large year-end surge, but is probably still robust in an underlying sense.  Household and non-financial corporate broad money deposits continue to grow steadily, but overall M4 growth remains subdued on account of further reductions in the sterling deposits of non-bank financial corporations.  Credit growth is strong.  Lending to households was 9.4% higher in Q4 than a year before.  This growth in borrowing, which has been associated with buoyant housing market activity, includes rising flows of mortgage equity withdrawal. The Bank’s official interest rate was increased by 0.25% in January, and by a further 0.25% to 6% in February. Market interest rate expectations have risen in the United Kingdom and elsewhere since the autumn. Labour market conditions may have tightened somewhat since the November Report.  Employment has continued to grow, although at a slower rate.  The rate of claimant count unemployment has fallen slightly to 4.0%, its lowest level for 20 years.  On the broader Labour Force Survey measure, the unemployment rate has remained constant.  Survey measures of employment intentions remain firm, and reports of skilled labour shortages have become more widespread.   Annual pay growth, as measured by the Average Earnings Index, was 4.9% in the three months to November—significantly more than expected at the time  iii Overview of the last Report.  Relatively few wage settlements have been reported so far this year, but those available are if anything a little lower on average than last year.  The consequences for firms’ costs of pay growth depend  on labour productivity.  Recent data suggest that  whole-economy productivity growth is recovering after several years below trend, and manufacturing productivity has picked up sharply. Sterling has risen further since the autumn, particularly in relation to the euro.  This exchange rate movement cannot readily be explained in terms of recent news about relative cyclical positions.  The starting-point for the projections in this Report is a sterling effective exchange rate index of 109.4, which is about 4% above the central path assumed in the November Report. There is, as always, great uncertainty about exchange rate prospects.  The projections below assume, in the central case, that sterling’s ERI declines to 107.1 at the two-year forecast horizon. The MPC’s best collective judgment of the prospects for GDP growth—assuming that the official interest rate remains at 6%—is shown in Chart 1.  In the central projection, annual growth rises towards 3% before easing to a little below 21/2%—near trend—for most of the forecast period.  The profile is similar to, but a little softer than, that in the November Report.  This is largely because the negative effects of the stronger exchange rate on net trade and of higher interest rates on the economy as a whole outweigh the positive effect on consumer demand of increases in income and wealth. The Committee’s best collective judgment of the prospects for RPIX inflation is shown in Chart 2.  The most likely outcome is for inflation to decline to around 2% during this year, and then to rise to around the 21/2% target in the second year of the projection.  Relative to the November profile, the principal upward influences on inflation are a higher path for nominal earnings growth and stronger determinants of consumer demand. The higher exchange rate and the interest rate rises since November are the main downward influences.  As the fan charts show, considerable uncertainties surround these projections.  The balance of risks to inflation is judged to be slightly on the upside;  the risks to output growth are thought to be broadly balanced. Some Committee members prefer to base their assessment of inflation prospects on assumptions that differ in part from those embodied in the fan chart Chart 2 Current RPIX inflation projection based on constant nominal interest rates at 6% 0 1 2 3 4 5 1995 96 97 98 99 2000 01 Percentage increase in prices on a year earlier 2.5 02 The fan chart depicting the probability distribution for inflation is rather  like a contour map.

Particular uncertainties exist about the future path of the exchange rate, and about the degree to which technological and competitive developments are likely to reduce inflation in the medium term. Alternative judgments on these issues led some Committee members to favour inflation profiles that would be higher or lower than that shown in Chart 2 by up to 1/2% at the two-year forecast horizon. The UK economy remains on course for steady growth. The high exchange rate means, however, that the prospect is one of continuing imbalance between domestic demand and external demand, and further pressure on the internationally exposed sectors of the economy.  Interest rates will continue to be set to achieve the 21/2% inflation target.  Inflation is at present on track to meet the target.

Narrow money growth remains strong, but unusually erratic movements around the turn of the millennium have obscured the underlying position.  Annual broad money growth picked up slightly in 1999 Q4, but has remained slow, owing to further reductions in deposits held by non-bank financial corporations.  However, deposits held by households and private non-financial corporations have grown more steadily over the past year.  Secured lending growth has strengthened, in line with robust housing market activity, and has included rising flows of mortgage equity withdrawal. Since the November Report, short-term interest rate expectations have risen in UK, euro-area and US financial markets, perhaps in response to  stronger-than-expected global economic data and the absence of significant economic disruption associated with the century date change.  Official interest rates have also increased.  In the United Kingdom, the MPC voted to raise the Bank of England’s official repo rate by  0.25 percentage points to 5.75% at its January meeting. And at its February meeting, the MPC voted to raise the Bank’s repo rate by a further 0.25 percentage points to 6%.  Since the November Report, ten-year nominal government bond yields have risen slightly in the United Kingdom, the euro area and the United States. The sterling exchange rate has strengthened  appreciably since the November Report, largely reflecting further rises against the euro.  Robust house price inflation and higher equity prices have increased household sector wealth, supporting the outlook for consumption. 1.1 Money and credit Narrow money Since the November Report, there has been an unusually large fluctuation in the value of notes and coin in circulation in the United Kingdom (see Chart 1.1).  The level of notes and coin in circulation typically rises sharply each year over the Christmas and New Year period before falling back in January, reflecting seasonal transactions-based demand (the value of retail sales is typically about 40% higher in December than in the rest  Inflation Report:  February 2000 4 of the year).  However, the rise in currency in  December 1999 was considerably larger than in previous years.  After adjusting for estimated seasonal effects, notes and coin in circulation increased by 3.5% in December, the largest one-month rise since decimalisation in 1971.  Despite indications of strong retail spending in December, particularly on items often paid for with cash such as food and drink, increased demand for notes and coin by the general public is unlikely to explain such sharp fluctuations.  It appears likely that a large proportion of the rise in December reflected efforts by banks and building societies to ensure that their automatic teller machine cash stocks— which count as notes in circulation—were sufficient to satisfy potential peak demand over the unusually long Christmas and new millennium holiday period.   Narrow money growth is calculated using an average of weekly observations of the level of notes and coin in circulation over the course of a month.  The unusually high level of notes and coin in circulation persisted well into the New Year, affecting the average weekly level in January proportionately more than in December, before returning to more normal levels later in the month (see Chart 1.1).  As a result, monthly growth in notes and coin in circulation remained strong, at 2.0% in  January.  Abstracting from these distortions to the underlying pattern, notes and coin growth has nevertheless risen sharply over the past year.  Weekly data from the end of January and start of February, when the distortions had largely unwound, suggested annual growth of about 8%–9%, broadly in line with the annual rate in November 1999 and considerably higher than in early 1999.  In the past, increases in narrow money growth have often been associated with higher nominal retail spending growth, although the relationship has been far from perfect (see Chart 1.2).  In 1999, retail spending growth rose, but by considerably less than narrow money growth, implying a decline in velocity.  Some of this fall in velocity might be explained by the reduced opportunity cost of holding cash, owing to the lower level of nominal interest rates in 1999.  However, this downward influence on velocity may weaken this year, given recent rises in nominal interest rates. Broad money Total M4 grew by 3.6% in the year to 1999 Q4, slightly higher than annual growth in the previous quarter (see Table 1.A).

In recent years, OFCs’ deposit holdings and total M4 have fluctuated much more sharply than nominal demand, making it hard to draw inferences about activity from aggregate broad money.  The deposit holdings of households and private non-financial corporations (PNFCs) have grown more steadily (see Chart 1.3).  Chart 1.4 shows that growth in broad money, excluding OFCs’ deposits, has been stable at around 6.5% over the past year, which is more consistent with the recent path of nominal demand growth. Divisia money provides an alternative indicator of deposits likely to be used in nominal spending.  The Divisia index is constructed as a weighted sum of broad money deposits, with more liquid deposit balances  given larger weights.  The liquidity of a deposit balance is assumed to be inversely related to the interest rate  paid on it.  So the higher the interest rate, the more likely the deposit is being held as savings rather than for use  in transactions, and so the lower the weight given to the deposit in the index.  Annual growth in total Divisia slowed by less than M4 growth in the first half of 1999, and picked up slightly, to 4.9%, in the fourth quarter. Growth in household Divisia, which may provide a better indicator of near-term nominal consumer spending, picked up strongly in 1999 Q4 on a quarter earlier, but annual growth remained steady at 6.6%. On the asset side of the banking sector’s balance sheet, annual growth in bank and building society lending increased to 8.5% in 1999 Q4, from 7.0% in the previous quarter (see Table 1.A).  Higher bank borrowing by OFCs was a significant factor in the pick-up in lending growth in 1999 Q4 (see Table 1.B).  But over the past year as a whole, robust lending to the household sector has accounted for most of the rise in total lending growth;  growth in lending to PNFCs has been steady and lending to OFCs has been volatile. Household sector Annual growth in household sector deposits has been broadly stable for several years and was 6.5% in  1999 Q4.  By contrast, annual growth in bank and building society lending to households picked up in 1999, reaching 9.4% in 1999 Q4, its highest rate since  1991.(1) A wider measure of lending to individuals, which also includes lending by institutions other than Chart 1.4 Growth in M4, M4 excluding OFCs, and  nominal GDP 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 1989 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 Percentage changes on a year earlier M4 M4 excluding OFCs Nominal GDP Sources:  Bank of England and ONS.

About 80% of the stock of lending to individuals is secured on assets such as houses, with unsecured lending accounting for the rest.  Annual secured lending growth rose to 8.3% in 1999 Q4, from 5.8% in the same quarter a year earlier, more than accounting for the pick-up in total borrowing growth.  Annual growth in unsecured lending to individuals has fallen slightly over the past year, but remained high, at 13.8%, in 1999 Q4. The rise in secured lending growth in 1999 was consistent with increasing housing market activity. Early in the year, approvals of new secured loans rose sharply (see Chart 1.5).  Many of these approved loan facilities subsequently flowed into net lending or provided finance for remortgaging activity.  But there was also a substantial build-up in the stock of unused approvals (see Chart 1.6).  In recent months, new loan approvals have at first stabilised and then fallen, suggesting slower secured lending growth in the near future.  But the existing stock of approved loan facilities, if it continues to be drawn down as in recent months, will tend to support secured lending in coming months, unless approval cancellations or mortgage repayments rise. Recent secured lending has also included a rising element of mortgage equity withdrawal (MEW), as individuals have increased borrowing over and above that required for home purchase or improvements.(1) The Bank estimate of MEW rose to £3.8 billion in 1999 Q3, from £2.3 billion in 1999 Q2.  One possibility is that households are turning increasingly to MEW, rather than more expensive unsecured debt, when raising new funds. However, as Chart 1.7 shows, total lending for consumption (defined as the sum of MEW and unsecured lending) rose in 1999 Q3 to its highest share in household disposable income since 1990, providing additional resources to finance current spending or the acquisition of financial assets. Private non-financial corporations Annual growth in PNFCs’ M4 deposits picked up to 7.3% in 1999 Q4, from weaker growth in the previous two quarters.

Sources:  ONS and Bank of England. (a) Defined as the change in PNFCs’ M4 borrowing minus the change in PNFCs’ M4 deposits. Money and financial markets 7 grew by 5.4% over the same period.  M4 borrowing by PNFCs has been subdued over the past year relative to the growing imbalance between corporate investment and saving (see Chart 1.8).  Instead, the PNFCs sector has met its rising financial deficit using funds raised in capital markets.  Part of this shift in the source of new corporate finance may be temporary.  Bond issuance was particularly high in early 1999, perhaps as companies reopened capital market borrowing programmes or placed new issues that had been delayed by the turbulence in financial markets in the second half of 1998.  But there has also been a longer-term decline in the relative importance to PNFCs of borrowing from the banking sector.  Over the past ten years, UK companies have gradually moved away from traditional bank borrowing towards marketable debt and equity finance. In recent years, as government debt issuance has fallen, increased institutional demand for corporate debt might have provided added impetus to this trend (see  Chart 1.9).(1) Financial deficits in recent years have slightly raised the stock of outstanding debt of the PNFCs sector relative to fixed assets valued at replacement cost (see Chart 1.10). But other indicators of PNFCs’ financial positions appear more favourable.  Income gearing, measured by corporate interest payments relative to current post-tax profits, is near historic lows.  And total debt remains low relative to current equity market valuations of corporate capital, which incorporate expectations of future profits. Other financial corporations Sterling deposits held by OFCs at UK banks and building societies have continued to contract (see  Chart 1.3).  In the year to 1999 Q4, the M4 deposits of OFCs fell by 6.3% to levels last seen in 1998 Q2. However, shorter-term comparisons suggest some easing in rates of decline.  In contrast to the weakness in deposit growth, sterling lending to OFCs by M4 institutions rose by 11.6% in the year to 1999 Q4, although growth has been particularly volatile in recent quarters (see  Table 1.B). 1.2 Interest rates and asset prices Short-term interest rates The MPC voted to raise the Bank’s official repo rate by  0.25 percentage points on 13 January.

(1) Recent trends in sterling bond issuance are discussed in ‘Sterling wholesale markets:  developments in 1999’, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, February 2000, pages 38–49.  Inflation Report:  February 2000 8 9–10 February the MPC voted to raise the official repo rate by a further 0.25 percentage points to 6%.  Official rates have also risen in the euro area and the United States since the previous Report.  The European Central Bank raised its official rate by 0.25 percentage points on  3 February.  And the US Federal Open Market Committee has increased the Federal funds target rate on two separate occasions, by a total of 0.50 percentage points, since the previous Report. The impact of official interest rate decisions on aggregate demand depends partly on the extent to which wholesale markets anticipate these decisions.  Chart 1.11 shows two-week forward rates for the United Kingdom derived from government bond and gilt repo rates on  3 November 1999 and 9 February 2000, using the Bank’s new yield curve estimation technique.(1) Since  3 November, forward rates have risen by around a quarter of a percentage point at the short end of the yield curve.  Technical factors mean that two-week market gilt repo rates tend to lie slightly below the official repo rate. So market expectations of future official interest rates are probably a little above those shown in Chart 1.11. Short-term interest rate expectations also rose in the euro area and the United States over this period, consistent with increasing market confidence about stronger global activity and concurrent rising inflationary concerns. International short-term interest rate expectations increased particularly sharply in early January, perhaps as market fears of possible economic disruption associated with the century date change subsided.   Changes in nominal interest rates reflect the combined effect of revisions to inflation expectations, real interest rates and risk premia.  In the United Kingdom, quarterly survey evidence for 1999 Q4 suggests that changes  in inflation expectations have been small in recent months.  That suggests that much of the rise in nominal rates has been reflected in higher real rates and/or risk premia. Chart 1.12 shows the risk-neutral probability distribution of expected three-month market interest rates derived from options prices on 9 February 2000.  Expectations for the market rate in question—the three-month interbank rate—will generally exceed expectations of the official repo rate.  The total width of the distribution at any point in time shows market uncertainty about the path of UK interest rates.

The fan chart depicting the probability distribution for short-term interest rates is rather like a contour map.  At any given point, the depth of shading  represents the height of the probability density function implied by the markets over a range of outcomes for short-term interest rates.  The markets judge that there is 10% chance of interest rates being within the darkest, central band at any date.  Each successive pair of bands covers a further 10% of the probability distribution until 90% of the distribution is covered.  The bands widen as the time horizon is extended, indicating increased uncertainty about interest rate outcomes.  Money and financial markets 9 and below the darkest band illustrates market views about the balance of risks to interest rates.  The chart indicates that the market places more weight on upside risks to short-term rates over the next two years.  A  new technique developed by the Bank can be used to estimate changes over time in market perceptions of  risk and uncertainty about the near-term path of interest rates over a constant six-month horizon in the future. These estimates suggest that upside risk and market uncertainty rose in the middle of last year but have changed little since the November Report (see  Chart 1.13).(1) One of the channels through which official and expected interest rates affect aggregate demand is their impact on mortgage rates.  Over the past year, standard variable mortgage rates have moved broadly in line with official interest rates (see Chart 1.14).  Fixed mortgage rates  tend to be set in relation to interest rates in the swaps market, at which lenders can exchange fixed-rate  income from mortgages for floating-rate income.  Fixed mortgage rates have risen since mid-1999, but by somewhat less than swap rates of comparable maturity (see Chart 1.15). Long-term interest rates Since the November Report, ten-year nominal bond yields have risen in the United Kingdom, the euro area and the United States (see Chart 1.16).  The UK ten-year nominal spot rate stood at 5.5% on 9 February, about 0.30 percentage points above its level on 3 November (see Table 1.C), although it remains low by recent historical standards.  UK corporate bond rates have also risen since the previous Report.  The continued low level of long-term corporate bond rates relative to shorter-term yields may partly have explained the pick-up in  long-maturity sterling corporate bond issuance since mid-1999. Equity prices Equity prices have risen in the United Kingdom, the euro area and the United States since the November Report (see Table 1.D).  In particular, there have been substantial increases in the valuations of IT stocks.  The box on page 10 discusses the contribution of these stocks to rises in international aggregate equity indices.

Within the totals, there have been particularly sharp increases in the share prices of companies operating in high technology sectors (see Chart A).  The valuation of the information technology (IT) sector of the FTSE All-Share index in the 15 days up to and including 9 February was double its level in the equivalent period three months ago.  The IT sector of the Datastream (DS) euro-area index is about 80% higher on the same basis.  Technology share prices in the United States rose by less than in Europe over this period, with the S&P 500 technology sector about 35% higher and the Nasdaq 100 index up by around 50%.   Aggregate share price indices are typically constructed  as weighted averages of individual share prices, where the weights are derived from the market values (or capitalisations) of each company.  So the impact on  the headline index of price rises in any sector will  depend on the share of the sector in total market capitalisation.   The table shows that technology sectors vary substantially in size across aggregate indices.  In the United States, the technology sector of the S&P 500 index accounts for a considerably larger proportion of total market capitalisation than the IT sectors of the FTSE All-Share and DS euro-area indices.  However, there are definitional difficulties in the allocation of companies to sectors, which make it hard to draw inferences from these data about structural variations across countries in the share of IT production in total output, or in IT companies’ use of equity finance.  Companies are classified to sectors on the basis of their primary activity.  So there will  inevitably be some companies that are not placed in the IT sector, but which still operate in high-technology areas, such as communications or electronics.  So the IT sectors of these indices can only provide partial coverage of economy-wide IT-based production.  Notwithstanding these definitional issues, variations in the size of technology sectors across indices imply differing contributions of technology sector share price changes to total equity price movements.  For example, the relatively high weight of the technology sector in the S&P 500 index means that it is much more sensitive to technology sector share price changes than the FTSE  All-Share and DS euro-area indices.  As such, the sector has more than accounted for the 8% rise in the S&P 500 since the previous Report (see Chart B), despite a smaller rise in technology share prices than in the European IT indices.  In the United Kingdom, the IT sector has accounted for almost half of the 5.7% increase in the FTSE All-Share index.  In the euro area, IT explains around a quarter of the 16% rise in the DS euro-area index. Chart A Selected technology sector equity price indices(a) 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 Jan. May Sept.

United Kingdom, the FTSE All-Share index averaged 2996 in the 15 working days up to and including  9 February, 5.7% above the 15 working day average used as the starting-point for the projection in the November Report.   Property prices Annual house price inflation has strengthened further in recent months.  The Halifax index rose by 16.0% in the year to January 2000, its highest rate of increase since July 1989 (see Chart 1.17), and the Nationwide index rose by 13.1% over the same period.  Sharp increases in house prices over the past year have led to substantial rises in household sector housing wealth (see Section 2). Evidence points to strengthening activity in the commercial property market.  Higher property rents and capital values have raised annual growth in total commercial property returns, as measured by the Investment Property Databank Ltd Index, to 14.2% in December 1999. Exchange rates The sterling effective exchange rate index (ERI) appreciated through most of 1999 and has risen by 2.4% on a trade-weighted basis between 3 November and  9 February (see Chart 1.18).  The 15 working day average of the ERI up to and including 9 February, used as the starting-point for the current projection, is 109.4, 3.6% higher than in the equivalent period three months ago and about 4.1% above the central projection for  February implied in the November Report.   Most of the rise in the ERI has reflected continued appreciation of sterling against the euro (see Chart 1.18). On a 15 day average basis, sterling has risen by 5.5% against the euro since the November Report, and by nearly 16% since the start of 1999.  These movements do not appear to be explained by changes in expected relative interest rate differentials between the United Kingdom and euro area, as reflected in yield curves. Against the US dollar, sterling has depreciated by 2.0% since the November Report on the same basis. UK trade flows partly depend on the level of the real exchange rate.  By combining consumer price inflation and nominal exchange rate expectations from Consensus Economics surveys, it is possible to construct a proxy expected real ERI for the United Kingdom.

More recent surveys suggest that agents came to expect less depreciation in the real sterling exchange rate than at that time.   1.3 Summary Narrow money has continued to grow strongly in recent months.  Exceptionally high growth over the year-end appears largely to reflect a temporary surge associated with the turn of the millennium, rather than any discernible change in trend.  Annual broad money growth has risen slightly but remains subdued, reflecting a continued rundown in deposits held by non-bank financial corporations.  Secured lending has picked up further and has included rising flows of mortgage equity withdrawal.  Equity prices have risen further and house price inflation has strengthened since the November Report.  Substantial increases in equity and house prices over the past year have raised household sector wealth. The sterling effective exchange rate has strengthened appreciably, particularly against the euro.  Short-term interest rates have risen in the United Kingdom.   Longer-term interest rates have also increased but remain low by recent historical standards.

Output growth strengthened in the second half of 1999. GDP rose by 0.8% in both the third and fourth quarters of the year, broadly in line with the projections in the November Report.  In terms of demand components, there was particularly strong growth in Q3 in  non-vehicle consumption, exports and imports.  By contrast, investment demand continued to slow, though that may have reflected temporary factors.  The balance of growth across different sectors of the economy has improved somewhat, as the pace of expansion has quickened in manufacturing and construction.  And the outlook for overseas demand growth has strengthened since November, reflecting developments both in industrialised economies and in the emerging markets.   2.1 External demand The outlook for growth in UK export markets has strengthened since the November Report.(1) The pace of expansion in the United States has remained remarkably robust, with GDP growth of 1.4% in both the third and fourth quarters of 1999.  In addition, recent revisions to estimated productivity growth suggest that the trend output growth rate in the United States may be higher than previously thought.  Demand growth in the euro area strengthened during 1999, and GDP rose by 1.0% in the third quarter of the year.  The outlook for continued growth in the region is supported by euro-area consumer and industrial confidence, which remain at high levels. Prospects for growth in Japan are broadly unchanged since November, but the outlook for the emerging Asian economies appears stronger, owing both to the improved economic outturns in China and Korea and to the significant recovery of output and trade growth in 1999 for most other countries in the region. Reflecting expanding demand in the United Kingdom’s export markets, growth in the volume of goods and services exported by the United Kingdom has recovered since the beginning of 1999, having slowed sharply in 1998 (see Chart 2.1).  Exports grew particularly rapidly in 1999 Q3, even excluding oil and erratic components: the volume of exports rose by 6.0%, compared with (1) For a detailed discussion of international economic developments, see ‘The international environment’ article in the Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, February 2000, pages 23–37.

That exceptionally sharp increase was partly reversed in the autumn, and monthly data suggest that total exports were weaker in Q4.  However, exports strengthened over 1999 as a whole (see Chart 2.2).  The pick-up in UK goods exports in 1999 occurred across a broad range of countries, though the strong growth in exports in July and August was most marked in sales to countries outside the European Union. As Chart 2.1 shows, the improvement in the United Kingdom’s export performance in recent quarters has broadly matched the growth of UK export markets, despite the continued appreciation of sterling, particularly against the euro.  Survey data also suggest that firms remain more optimistic about their export prospects than in the first half of 1999 (see Table 2.A). Some producers may have sought to retain their share of export markets in the face of the exchange rate appreciation by not passing on its effects to their foreign-currency export prices.  Consistent with this, sterling prices of UK non-oil exports fell by around 2% in the first three quarters of 1999.  A recent survey by the Bank’s regional Agents also suggested that exporters’ acceptance of lower profit margins was an important influence on recent export growth.  However, the proportion of firms citing the exchange rate as a causal factor in weaker-than-expected profits appears to have decreased since the end of 1998 (see Chart 2.3). Furthermore, manufacturing productivity growth has risen substantially since the beginning of 1999, as output growth has strengthened and firms have shed labour.  So some firms may have found efficiencies in production techniques that have helped them to adapt to the higher exchange rate.   Net trade contributed 0.3 percentage points to GDP growth in 1999 Q3.  Despite the robust growth of exports in 1999 Q3, this contribution to GDP growth was smaller than in Q2, as import growth also picked up strongly.  Changes in import growth tend to reflect movements in domestic demand growth, which was stronger in Q3 than in Q2 (see Chart 2.4), largely on account of the rebuilding of inventories in Q3.  Previous Reports have noted that the slowdown in import growth during early 1999 might correspondingly have reflected reductions in inventory levels by UK firms at that time. The appreciation of sterling during 1999 could also  have tended to increase import penetration in recent quarters.

Survey data indicate weaker inventory investment in early 2000, as firms run down any precautionary holdings built up before the new millennium, and this may weaken demand for imports. But underlying growth in imports is likely to remain strong over the next two years, as domestic demand growth continues above trend.  Reflecting the positive outlook for prospective overseas demand, the MPC judges that exports will grow steadily throughout the forecast period, although the recent appreciation of sterling has lowered the projection relative to the November Report.  On balance, the MPC’s central assumptions imply that the contribution of net trade to GDP growth will be significantly negative during the forecast period.  While the overall prospects for the world economy have continued to improve, the MPC also judges that the balance of risks around the central projection for world activity remains on the downside. One risk identified by the Committee was the possibility of a sharper-than-expected slowdown in the United States. 2.2 Domestic demand Domestic demand grew by 0.5% in the third quarter of 1999, compared with growth of 0.1% in the previous quarter, largely owing to a recovery in inventory investment in Q3.  Growth of final domestic demand— which excludes inventory investment—remained moderate, although it was slower than in the first half of the year.  That reflected slightly weaker growth in both public and private sector consumption, as well as a marked slowdown in business investment growth (see Table 2.B).   Revisions to the National Accounts, which were published in December, have affected the estimated pattern of expenditure growth in 1998 and the first three quarters of 1999.  Domestic demand growth was revised up in 1998, and revised down in 1999.  On balance, the level of domestic demand in 1999 Q3 is slightly lower than previously reported, as an upward revision to the level of business investment was more than offset by reductions in the levels of public and private consumption.  Consumption Consumers’ expenditure remained robust in 1999 Q3, though growth was slower than at the beginning of 1999 (see Chart 2.5).

Inflation Report:  February 2000 16 Consumer spending on cars in the United Kingdom Household expenditure on vehicles in the United Kingdom totalled more than £28 billion in 1998.  That accounted for half of consumer spending on durable goods, and around 5% of total household consumption.   Before 1999, a clear seasonal pattern in this expenditure had been observed.  The ‘letter’ prefix to car registration numbers was changed each year in August, and there was a preference amongst buyers of new cars for models with registration plates displaying the new prefix.  As a result, vehicle spending typically rose sharply in the third quarter of each year, before falling back in the fourth quarter.  Seasonal adjustment of consumption data in the National Accounts took account of this well-established pattern, smoothing the profile of vehicle spending over the year (see Chart A). However, the timing of registration plate changes was altered in 1999, with new prefixes introduced twice a year, in March and September.  Correspondingly, unadjusted vehicle expenditure rose markedly in the first as well as the third quarter of 1999, rendering the old pattern of seasonal adjustments inappropriate.  The introduction of new seasonal adjustment factors for vehicles in the  December 1999 National Accounts accounted for a significant proportion of the downward revision made to household consumption data in the first half of 1999.  In real terms, the revisions left the seasonally adjusted level of spending on vehicles 8% lower in 1999 Q2 than had been previously estimated. As the economic upturn and consumer confidence have strengthened since the end of 1998, spending on durable goods other than cars has picked up.  Historically, purchases of cars move broadly in line with the economic cycle. However, sales of cars to households did not strengthen in the first three quarters of 1999 (see Chart B), and more recent data suggest that consumer demand for cars weakened markedly in 1999 Q4.  Private new car registrations were 2.5% lower in 1999 than in 1998, and in Q4 they were 11% lower than a year earlier.(1) In each month between October 1999 and January 2000, the CBI distributive trades survey suggested that a substantial majority of motor traders were experiencing ‘poor’ unit sales given the time of year.  The recent weakness of car sales may partly reflect the effects of an inquiry into UK car retailing which is currently being undertaken by the Competition Commission.  The Commission has not yet published its final conclusions, but it has expressed the view that the present system of distribution in the United Kingdom has led Chart A Household expenditure on vehicles(a) 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 1990 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 Constant 1995 prices, 1995 = 100 Unadjusted series Seasonally  adjusted series (a) Includes cars, aeroplanes, boats and caravans.

(1) Source:  Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.  Demand and output 17 growth has eased since the beginning of 1999 is spending on durable goods.  However, that partly reflects developments in the UK car market, which may have depressed consumer spending on vehicles in recent months, perhaps temporarily.  Excluding vehicles, spending on durable goods accelerated in 1999 Q3.  That was consistent with higher levels of activity in the housing market (see Chart 2.6)—home-related items account for close to two thirds of non-vehicle durable goods spending.   Data on new car registrations suggest that vehicle sales were particularly weak between October 1999 and January 2000, perhaps in anticipation of the outcome of the Competition Commission’s investigation into car retailing (see the box opposite).  By contrast,  non-vehicle consumption growth appears to have remained strong in 1999 Q4.  Retail sales volumes in the three months to December were 1.3% higher than in the previous three months (see Chart 2.7), and 4.7% above their level in the same period a year earlier.  As noted in Section 1, that is consistent with recent movements in household borrowing for consumption, which grew rapidly in earlier quarters and accelerated further in Q4. The particular strength of consumer expenditure  towards the end of 1999 may have partly reflected Chart 2.6 Housing market transactions and spending  on home-related goods 8 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 1987 89 91 93 95 97 99 25 20 15 10 5 0 5 10 15 20 25 Spending on home-related  goods (a)   (left-hand scale) Housing market  transactions (b)  (right-hand scale)  Percentage change on a quarter earlier Percentage change on a quarter earlier + – + – Sources:  ONS and Inland Revenue.

In the year to December, new car prices fell by 2.1% and used car prices—which are included in the RPI—fell by 5.8%.   It is possible that the prospect of changes in the competitive structure of the car market has played a role in depressing car prices in recent months, and might also be perceived by consumers as likely to lead to further price declines.  That might be dampening current retail sales, as households may be deferring purchases in the expectation that prices will fall further.  Hence some of the particular weakness of household expenditure on vehicles in late 1999 might not persist, particularly once the Competition Commission’s report is published and its implications become clear.

However, the most  recent CBI distributive trades survey gave little sign  that the strength of retail sales had unwound after  the new year, as the seasonally adjusted retail sales balance for January was higher than in any month since October 1996.   Consumption expenditure is related, among other things, to households’ real incomes.  Real post-tax labour income grew strongly in 1999 Q3, and was 3% higher than a year earlier—the fastest annual growth rate  since 1997 Q4.  By contrast, non-labour income, such  as dividend payments, fell sharply in 1999 Q3.  But  this component tends to be much more volatile from quarter to quarter than labour income (see Chart 2.8), and the recent pattern of non-labour income has been affected by the abolition of Advance Corporation Tax (ACT).  That led many companies to switch the timing of their dividend payments in 1999 from Q1 to Q2,  with a subsequent fall back in Q3.  Non-labour income  growth is expected to recover once the effects of  these distortions have passed, and the MPC has  revised up its projections for labour income over the forecast period, reflecting expectations of faster earnings growth.   Household income is, however, only one of several determinants of consumption.  For example, an increase in households’ wealth tends to raise their consumption relative to income.  One way that this can occur is if households use this wealth as collateral for secured borrowing, as is the case in mortgage equity withdrawal. Consistent with robust consumption growth in recent quarters and the upturn in secured lending to households noted in Section 1, increases in household wealth in Q2 and Q3 were indeed stronger than had been assumed in earlier Reports.  The increase in housing wealth was particularly marked:  the ratio of gross housing wealth to post-tax income rose from 2.6 in 1999 Q1 to 2.9 in  1999 Q3 (see Chart 2.9).  Significant rises in house prices and equity prices since then will have raised household wealth further in recent months.  Households’ assessment of their likely future financial position may also affect their consumption relative to current income.  The more confident that households are about the economic factors that are likely to affect them in the future, the higher current consumption is likely to be, since households will tend to save a smaller share of their current income as a precaution against any potential adverse economic developments.  Such economic factors Chart 2.9 Ratios of household wealth to post-tax income(a) 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 1987 89 91 93 95 97 99 Ratios Gross housing wealth  Net financial wealth (b) Gross financial wealth (a) Using a four-quarter moving sum of income.

(a) Expectations relate to the year ahead. might include households’ expectations of unemployment, which would affect consumer confidence about future labour income.  Fears of rising unemployment have receded since the end of 1998 and measures of consumer confidence about households’ future financial situation stabilised at high levels in the second half of 1999 (see Chart 2.10), consistent with continued strength in the outlook for consumption in 2000.  Correspondingly, the GfK index of households’ expected future spending reached its highest level in January since the survey began in mid-1995. Given the strength of current and prospective household income, wealth, confidence and borrowing, the MPC judges that consumption growth is likely to remain well above trend in the coming quarters.  Somewhat slower consumption growth is projected towards the end of the forecast period, partly reflecting the lagged effects of recent rises in interest rates.  There may be some continued softness of total expenditure on durable goods owing to developments in the UK car market, but this is expected to be temporary.   Investment demand Revisions to the National Accounts have raised estimates of investment in 1998, reinforcing the picture of  strong investment growth between 1996 and 1998.   By contrast, business investment growth in 1999 slowed markedly (see Chart 2.11).  In 1999 Q3, total gross  fixed capital formation rose by 0.1% on the previous quarter but, within this, business investment fell  by 1.0%, the first quarterly decline since 1996 Q4.   The recent weakness of investment has been concentrated in the manufacturing sector, but the fall in business investment in Q3 was also reported in the service sector.  The slowdown in business investment growth is likely to have reflected the lagged effects of a sharp decline in firms’ profit expectations in 1998 (see Chart 2.12), which was followed by a fall in actual corporate  profits in late 1998 and early 1999.  Weaker investment growth in mid-1999 could also have reflected millennium-related influences on the timing of business investment decisions.  For example, concerns about the ‘millennium bug’ might have brought forward some planned investment in information technology (IT) equipment that would otherwise have taken place at a later time, in order to ensure ‘Y2K compliance’. Caution about the possible effects of any ‘bug’ might also have delayed some planned IT investment until after Chart 2.11 Gross fixed capital formation(a) 15 10 5 0 5 10 15 20 25 1988 90 92 94 96 98 Percentage changes on a year earlier Business investment Whole economy (b) + – (a) At constant 1995 prices.

Figures refer to shares in whole-economy  investment. the turn of the millennium.  Reports from the Bank’s regional Agents support the hypothesis that the decline in business investment in 1999 was influenced by these considerations. The ONS has released new calculations of the capital stock for 1998, together with revisions extending back over a number of years.  The level of the business sector’s capital stock since 1994 is lower than previously estimated, and although the ratio of business investment to GDP has risen to historically high levels, the ratio of the capital stock to GDP has been broadly flat over that period (see Chart 2.13).(1) The revision reflects an assessment by the ONS that the rate of depreciation applicable to investment goods in recent years is higher than was previously thought.  That primarily reflects a view that a growing proportion of UK investment has been directed towards capital goods with shorter  life-spans, such as IT equipment.  Spending on IT is included in ONS figures for investment in general equipment and machinery, whose share in total investment has indeed been rising since 1994 (see  Chart 2.14).(2) A rise in the share of IT equipment in total business investment is consistent with the decline in prices of IT goods relative to other investment goods throughout the 1990s.     Forward-looking indicators tend to support a stronger outlook for business investment growth in the near term. Following several quarters of negative growth, the gross operating surplus of UK companies rose by 3.5% in 1999 Q3, and was 1.6% higher than a year earlier.  Oil companies accounted for much of that increase, but a recovery in corporate profits was also reported in the non-oil sector.  Survey evidence for both the manufacturing and service sectors suggests that profit expectations and investment intentions have risen (see Chart 2.12), and that capacity utilisation increased in these sectors in 1999.  Consistent with these indicators, the MPC has assumed in its central projection that some of the slowdown in investment in 1999 reflects a temporary ‘pause’ owing to the impact of the millennium.  The Committee projects a modest recovery in investment growth in 2000 from its current low rates, (1) These estimates are provisional and final figures will be published in the 2000 edition of the National Accounts Blue Book.  The ONS reassessment of the capital stock and depreciation rate is detailed in two articles by West, P and Clifton-Fearnside, A: ‘The capital stock of the United Kingdom—some new developments in coverage and methodology’, Economic Trends, No 544, March 1999, pages 39–48, and ‘Improving the non-financial balance sheets and capital stocks estimates’, Economic Trends, No 552, November 1999, pages 53–67. (2) National Accounts data do not provide a more disaggregated measure of investment in types of capital asset within the class of ‘general equipment and machinery’.

Demand and output 21 with the strength of recent survey data suggesting a possible upside risk to this central projection. Inventories Changes in inventory levels contributed 0.7 percentage points to GDP growth in 1999 Q3 (excluding the National Accounts alignment adjustment), following a decline in whole-economy inventories during the first half of 1999.  The outturn in Q3 was consistent with the MPC’s expectations of stockbuilding ahead of the turn of the millennium, for precautionary and celebratory purposes.   Both the decline in stocks in the first half of 1999 and the rise in stock levels since then have largely reflected movements in manufacturers’ inventories (see  Chart 2.15).  Survey evidence for the manufacturing sector is broadly consistent with this observed pattern, and tends to suggest further reductions in stock levels in early 2000.  For example, the CBI quarterly industrial trends survey reported that the proportion of manufacturers regarding their stocks of finished goods as ‘more than adequate’ fell between the middle and the end of 1999, but that manufacturers expected to run down their stocks at a faster rate in the coming months. Similarly, CIPS surveys have indicated that purchases of materials by manufacturers picked up in the second half of 1999, partly to guard against possible ‘Y2K’ disruptions to the supply chain.  These precautionary purchases were reported to have fallen back after the New Year as firms ran down their excess stocks.  The CIPS manufacturing output index also fell in January, as both manufacturers and their customers reduced stocks of finished goods which they had built up before the new millennium.   Public sector demand Estimates of nominal government consumption of goods and services in the first three quarters of 1999 were revised up in the December 1999 release of the  National Accounts.  However, the real government consumption profile over that period was lower, owing  to upward revisions to the government expenditure deflator.  In assessing the outlook for the public finances, the MPC has taken as its central case the nominal government expenditure plans and effective tax rates from the pre-Budget Report (PBR) published on  9 November 1999.  Given the MPC’s new forecast for inflation, these PBR projections now imply a somewhat weaker profile for real government consumption over the forecast period than in the November Report.

However, the estimated growth profile is a little different.  The data now show a more marked pause in growth in 1998 Q4, followed by faster growth in the first half of 1999 than in earlier estimates.  GDP at constant market prices grew by 0.8% in each of the third and fourth quarters of 1999, and in Q4 was 2.7% higher than a year earlier (see Chart 2.17).  Manufacturing output grew by 0.7% in 1999 Q4, the third consecutive quarter of expansion, and was 1.9% higher than a year earlier (see Chart 2.18).  The annual growth rate was the highest since mid-1995, although the quarterly growth rate was slower than in the previous quarter, when manufacturing output rose by 1.4%.  The CIPS purchasing managers’ index rose sharply in Q4 (see Chart 2.19), which was reported to have reflected an increase in manufacturers’ stock positions before the year-end, as a precaution against possible supply disruptions related to the ‘millennium bug’.  Some of the rise in the CIPS index at the end of 1999 was correspondingly reversed in January, as manufacturers ran down these stocks.  But the index remains at a level suggesting steady expansion of manufacturing output, in line with reports from the Bank’s regional Agents and other survey evidence.  For example, the CBI reported that manufacturers’ output expectations were positive for the sixth successive month in January, with expectations of future export orders in December and January at their highest for two years. The recovery in manufacturing observed in 1999 was particularly concentrated in the engineering, metals and chemicals sectors.  Growth in other sectors remained more subdued, and output was flat or falling in some industries, such as textiles and paper products.  The  non-manufacturing components of industrial production were also weaker than manufacturing as a whole;  output in both the mining and quarrying sector and the utilities sector declined in Q4.       Preliminary estimates suggest that service sector output rose by 0.9% in 1999 Q4, following an increase of 0.6% in the previous quarter, with the level of output 2.9% higher than a year earlier (see Chart 2.18).  Growth was reported to have been particularly strong in the transport, Chart 2.18 Sectoral output growth(a) 1993 94 95 96 97 98 99 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 + _ Services  Manufacturing  Percentage changes on a year earlier  GDP (a) GDP at constant 1995 market prices, manufacturing and services output  at constant 1995 basic prices.

Survey data indicate that the outlook for service sector growth remains firm.  The BCC survey suggested that service sector sales and orders, both domestic and exported, continued to rise in 1999 Q4, though export order growth slowed compared with Q3. The CIPS services business activity index in Q4 rose to its highest level since 1998 Q1 (see Chart 2.20), and reported new business continued to grow strongly, though at a slightly slower rate than in the previous two quarters.  Recent CIPS reports suggest that one service industry experiencing weaker growth in late 1999 was IT and computing.  However, activity in that sector rebounded in January, as the earlier slowdown was reported to have reflected some customers’ deferral of new IT orders until the effects of any ‘millennium bug’ were known.  There are signs that the modest recovery in the construction sector, which began in the first half of 1999, gathered pace in the second half of the year. Construction output increased by 0.6% in 1999 Q3 and was 1.4% higher than a year earlier.  New construction orders were weaker than the sector’s output indicators in 1999 Q3 (see Chart 2.21).  However, new orders data tend to be rather volatile, and survey indicators continue to suggest that robust growth is expected over the coming year (see Chart 2.22).  Construction output in the housing sector has been particularly buoyant, reflecting high levels of transactions activity in the private housing market, though the CIPS survey suggests that growth in the sector has slowed somewhat in recent months. Survey measures suggested that production capacity became somewhat scarcer during 1999, as the economic recovery strengthened (see Chart 2.23).  The CIPS index of ‘outstanding business’ in the service sector rose throughout 1999, and in December reached its highest level since February 1998, indicating that capacity constraints may have become more significant in recent months.  The BCC measure of service sector capacity utilisation also rose markedly in 1999, particularly in the last quarter of the year.  Consistent with reports from the Bank’s regional Agents, the CBI quarterly industrial trends survey reported that most manufacturing firms continue to operate with spare capacity.  However, the CBI survey suggested that the proportion of manufacturing firms with spare capacity was slightly lower in the second half of 1999 than in the first half of the year, and the number reporting that plant capacity Chart 2.21 Construction output and new orders 12 8 4 0 4 8 12 16 20 1987 89 91 93 95 97 99 30 20 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 Percentage change on a year earlier New orders   (left-hand scale)  Output   (right-hand scale) + – Percentage change on a year earlier + – Source:  Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions.  Inflation Report:  February 2000 24 was likely to limit future output rose throughout 1999. Similarly, the CIPS manufacturing survey suggested that supply conditions within the sector have tightened over the past year.  The BCC measure of capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector also rose during 1999, to a level last reported in the second half of 1996.  In the construction sector, CIPS reports suggested that supplier delivery times continued to lengthen, though at a less marked pace than in mid-1999. 2.4 Summary Prospects for continued economic growth in the United Kingdom have remained favourable since the November Report.  Household wealth, labour income, borrowing and confidence have grown strongly, supporting the outlook for consumption.  Survey data on profit expectations, capacity utilisation and investment intentions suggest that the slowdown in investment growth in 1999 may have been partly a temporary phenomenon.  The pattern of exports in the second half of 1999 was rather volatile, but the immediate outlook for international growth is somewhat stronger than at the time of the last Report.  However, the appreciation of sterling and the rise in interest rates are likely to dampen output growth.  Reflecting the balance of these considerations, the MPC expects annual growth of GDP to slow from above-trend rates to a little below 21/2% in the coming quarters.

Employment growth remains firm, though total hours worked have fallen. There has been a small rise in LFS unemployment, perhaps because previously inactive people have been encouraged to look for work again, though the claimant count measure continues to fall.  Labour shortages have increased.  They remain more acute in some regions, and in some sectors, than in others.  Average earnings growth has been stronger than expected.  If anything, settlements have edged down.  So components of pay not covered by wage settlements appear to have risen further.  Firms may have needed to pay higher wages to attract new recruits, or to make larger payments to retain staff.  In addition, employers may have chosen to increase the proportion of the total pay bill that reflects individual productivity and performance. 3.1 Employment, non-employment and  labour market tightness Total hours worked, often regarded as the broadest measure of labour supplied, fell by 0.1% in the three months to November, but remained above levels seen during the first half of last year.  The change in total hours worked depends on the change in the number of employed people, and the change in the average number of hours that each employed person works.  Table 3.A shows that the number of employed people rose steadily between autumn 1998 and autumn 1999, but the average number of hours that each employed person worked tended to fall.  This fall was not caused by a switch from full-time to part-time work, as the number of full-time workers grew more rapidly than the number of part-time workers during the period.  Compliance with the Working Time Directive (WTD) may have been a factor. The WTD came into force in October 1998.  It places restrictions on working more than 48 hours a week, as well as limiting shift work patterns and broadening statutory holiday entitlements.  Limited information on the distribution of hours worked is available from the Labour Force Survey (LFS).  This shows that, since the beginning of 1998, there has been a fall in the percentage of full-time employees in the highest hours-worked Table 3.A The quantity of labour Per cent, unless otherwise stated 1999 Dec. 1998 Mar.

These movements represent a reversal of the trend seen during much of the early 1990s (see Chart 3.1). The measures of employment outlined above count employed people.  Like most data from the LFS, they are based on responses to a rolling three-month survey. Another source of employment data, the Workforce Jobs survey, provides estimates of the number of jobs in different industries on a single day towards the end of each quarter.  In 1999 Q3, the number of jobs in the production industries fell for the sixth consecutive quarter.  There was a large fall in the number of agricultural jobs, and the number of construction and service sector jobs rose only moderately, so the total number of Workforce Jobs fell for the first time in more than a year (see Chart 3.2).  Because of the way they are measured, Workforce Jobs data tend to be more variable than data from the LFS. The two different sources of data on employment provide two different measures of labour productivity: output per person employed (based on the LFS);  and output per job (based on Workforce Jobs).  Chart 3.3 shows that measured productivity growth has in the past varied substantially over the economic cycle.  Since the mid-1990s it has been more stable, partly because the cycle has been less marked, and partly because labour market reforms over the past two decades have made it possible for firms to adjust labour input more rapidly in response to changes in demand.  Productivity growth has been below its long-run average rate, which is close to 2%, for the past four or five years.  With no good reason to believe that a shift in the trend rate had occurred, the MPC has for some time assumed that labour productivity growth will return to more normal rates.  There is some evidence of a rise in labour productivity growth towards the end of last year. Employment growth has probably continued into the New Year.  The CIPS employment index, a weighted average of responses to their services, manufacturing and construction sector surveys, was 50.9 in January.  This index, which provides a more timely indicator of employment trends than the official data, has remained above the no-change level of 50 since June (see  Chart 3.4).  And the latest CBI/PricewaterhouseCoopers survey found that employment growth in the financial Chart 3.1 Distribution of full-time employees’ usual  weekly working hours(a) 67 69 71 73 75 77 79 1984 86 88 90 92 94 96 98 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 Per cent Per cent Proportion working    between 31 and 45 hours    (right-hand scale)  Proportion working    more than 45 hours    (left-hand scale) 0 0 Note:  Shaded area indicates period during which Working Time Directive  in operation.

Turning to  forward-looking indicators, Table 3.B shows that the balances of respondents to both the BCC and CBI surveys of manufacturing firms, and to the BCC survey of service sector firms, who planned to recruit during the next few months were all above their sample averages in 1999 Q4.  Recent Bank work has found that, historically, these survey balances have provided incremental information about changes in employment over the subsequent quarter.  On that basis, employment might be expected to increase further in 2000 Q1. An important determinant of wage pressure is the balance between the demand for, and the supply of, labour.  One measure of this balance is the number of people who are searching for work, and are currently available to start.  This is captured by LFS unemployment, which rose by 11,000 during the three months to November compared with the previous three months.  It is possible that some individuals have been encouraged to search for work again as the expansion of output has continued.  These individuals would not necessarily be included in the other, narrower measure of unemployment, the claimant count, which fell by 29,000 in the three months to November, and by a further 22,000 in December.  While recent evidence on unemployment is mixed, it is clear that the unemployment rate is considerably lower than it was at the trough that occurred in the second quarter of 1990 (see Chart 3.5).  That does not necessarily mean that the labour market is tighter now than it was then.  To make a full comparison, it is important to consider whether, and to what extent, the structural performance of the labour market has changed during the intervening period. The locus of points in Chart 3.6 shows how the change in real unit labour costs, ie the change in the real cost to firms of hiring the labour necessary to produce a given quantity of output, has varied with LFS unemployment. Over the past decade there has been a leftward shift in this locus.  That is consistent with the equilibrium rate of unemployment (the rate at which there is no change in real unit labour costs in the medium-to-long term, and hence no upward or downward pressure on inflation from the labour market) having fallen. Over the past two decades there have been a number of reforms—for example to employment legislation, and to the tax and benefit system—that might have contributed to a reduction in the equilibrium rate of unemployment.

One example would be the reduction in the number of young people entering the labour market, the effects of which were considered in the November Report.  Another structural change that could reduce the amount of wage pressure for a given national unemployment rate is a reduction in the geographical dispersion of unemployment. To see why dispersion might be important, consider a country with two equally-sized geographical areas, A and B.  Assume that the unemployment rate is 3% in area A and 7% in area B.  Now the situation changes so that unemployment is 5% in both areas.  If the downward pressure on wages following the rise in unemployment in area A more than offsets the upward pressure on wages following the fall in unemployment in area B, then the reduction in unemployment dispersion would reduce pressure on average wage rates across the country, even though the national unemployment rate had remained the same.  Two common measures of dispersion are absolute and relative dispersion.  The former is a weighted variance of local unemployment rates.  The latter is a weighted variance of the ratio of local unemployment rates to the national average.   Chart 3.7 shows that absolute dispersion has always been higher, the higher the level of disaggregation, reflecting the dispersion within regions as well as between regions. Whether we look at regional or county data, absolute dispersion is lower now than during the late 1980s.  This is true also of the relative measure, though relative dispersion has tended to increase during the past few years. The unemployment rate is lower now than during the late 1980s, but the employment rate is lower too.  That is because the inactivity rate, defined as the percentage of the working-age population who are either not searching for work, or are searching for work but not currently available to start, is much higher (see Chart 3.8).  This could be relevant for the interpretation of the current level of unemployment, because many of the inactive are loosely attached to the labour market and can, to a degree, be considered as part of the available labour supply.  They may, as a result, exert some downward pressure on wage rates, though perhaps to a lesser extent than those who are recorded as unemployed. Table 3.C shows the proportion of individuals who moved from one of seven different categories of  non-employment during the spring quarter (March to Chart 3.6 Unemployment and the change in real  unit labour costs(a) 3 Percentage changes in real unit labour costs on a year earlier LFS unemployment rate (per cent) 3 2 1 0 1 2 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1985 1986 1993 1996 1998 1999 (b) + _ 1990 1988 Sources:  ONS and Bank of England.

It appears that the group of people most likely to find work were those who had been unemployed for less than six months, and that the likelihood of finding work falls as the time for which the person has been unemployed increases. As a group, the unemployed move more readily into employment than the inactive.  But a proportion of individuals in all forms of inactivity have found work in the subsequent quarter, even some of those who were not searching because they believed that no work was available.  As the economy continues to expand and more jobs become available, the discouraged may start to search for work again.  And those people looking after the family home, but who would work if the ideal job became available, may find it profitable to seek employment as job opportunities and wage rates rise.  So a wide range of people classified as inactive may have some influence on pay pressures. Chart 3.9 compares an index of LFS unemployment  with an index of weighted non-employment, based on the number of individuals in each of the seven categories of non-employment listed in Table 3.C, weighted together according to the average frequency at which they have entered employment.  Weighted  non-employment is less cyclical than unemployment.   It has fallen much less rapidly than unemployment during the present expansion, so that, during the  three months to November, weighted non-employment was close to its level at the time of the most recent trough in 1990 Q2, while unemployment itself was much lower.  The difference in the behaviour of the  two series is explained partly by the fact that inactivity has risen, and partly by the fact that a greater proportion of those who are unemployed are short-term unemployed. An alternative approach to the assessment of labour market tightness is to ask firms directly about their own experience.  The British Chambers of Commerce reported that recruitment difficulties last year were higher than on average during the ten-year lifetime of the survey, though lower than they had been in the middle of 1998.  A longer run of data is available, for the manufacturing sector alone, from the Confederation of British Industry.  They found that, while skilled labour shortages rose last year, they remained well below the historic peaks of the early 1970s and the mid to late Chart 3.9 Measures of labour market tightness(a) 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 1984 86 88 90 92 94 96 98 Weighted    non-employment (b) Unemployment Index, spring 1990 = 100 Sources:  ONS and Bank of England.

According to the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC),(1) the availability of both permanent and temporary (or contract) staff has been falling since last June.  Reports from the Bank’s regional Agents, based on discussions with a range of business contacts, paint a similar picture.  There was an increase in skill shortages across much of the country during the second half of last year.  Shortages remain more acute in the South than elsewhere, and there is some variation by industrial sector, with vacancies in IT, engineering and construction particularly hard to fill. Chart 3.11 shows that the average time taken to fill Jobcentre vacancies rose further in 1999 Q4.  It is possible that some of the rise in average duration could have occurred if a greater proportion of people now find work in other ways, by responding to newspaper advertisements for example, or by visiting private recruitment agencies.  Nevertheless, some of the rise is likely to reflect a general increase in the difficulty faced by firms in filling vacancies by whatever means. 3.2 Earnings and settlements Earnings growth, as measured by the Average Earnings Index (AEI), has been stronger than expected.  In the November central projection for inflation, the Committee had assumed that growth in the AEI would fall during the fourth quarter, partly because it was thought that some of the strength in the third quarter was erratic.  However, in November the headline annual increase in the AEI was still 4.9%, the same as the August figure (which had been the latest available when the previous Report was published).  So high rates of earnings growth have persisted.  Chart 3.12 shows that, since last summer, earnings growth has risen in both manufacturing and service sector firms.  However, the breakdown by public and private sectors is not so even. All of the recent increase in earnings growth was accounted for by the private sector, with public sector earnings growth falling from 4.8% in June to 3.9% in November. The AEI provides a comprehensive measure of employees’ earnings, but other measures of earnings are available.  Information on wages and salaries paid to the households sector is published quarterly with the National Accounts.

(b) Difference between earnings growth and settlements. are derived from tax returns (though early estimates use information from both the AEI and the New Earnings Survey).  At the beginning of last year, annual earnings growth as measured by wages and salaries per head was a little higher than as measured by the AEI.  In  1999 Q3, the two measures gave identical readings of 4.7%.  Private sector indicators of earnings growth, which are based on much smaller samples, offer conflicting evidence.  According to the REC, salaries for permanent staff rose in January at the fastest rate for more than a year, while growth in pay rates for temporary (or contract) staff fell for the second consecutive month.  The Reward index of annual earnings growth remains close to 3.5%, well below the official measures. The change in the AEI is an estimate of the change in total pay per worker.  It can be helpful to think of this change as the sum of two parts:  an across-the-board change in pay that all workers in a firm receive for doing a standard day’s work, more usually called the settlement;  and a second component, ‘wage drift’, that will reflect, among other things, changes in overtime payments, profit-related pay, bonuses, and the size of individual merit awards.  Chart 3.13 plots a measure of the average settlement recorded during the past twelve months, taken from the Bank of England’s database, against the headline annual increase in total pay as measured by the AEI.  Despite a slight edging down of settlements since the beginning of last year, the rate of increase of total pay has gone up.  The mean  AEI-weighted settlement over the twelve months to November 1999 was 3.5%.  The corresponding increase in headline average earnings was 4.9%.  By implication wage drift was 1.4 percentage points (see Chart 3.13). Overtime hours worked appear to have stabilised, having fallen quite sharply during the early part of last year. This could account for at least part of the increase in wage drift.  But another part is perhaps explained by the fact that the labour market turned out to be considerably tighter in 1999 than had been expected early in the year when most settlements were announced.  Indeed, unemployment continued to fall during the year, contrary to widespread expectations that it would increase.  This also led to a downward revision of forecasts for unemployment in 2000 (see Table 3.D).  There is some evidence from the Bank’s regional Agents that, rather than wait until the next settlement round, a number of firms responded by making larger bonus payments, by taking on some new staff at higher wage rates, and by Table 3.D Forecasts and outturns for claimant count unemployment Millions  1999 Q4 2000 Q4 Forecast made: January 1999 (a)  1.6 1.8 January 2000 (a)  n.a 1.1 Outturn 1.2 n.a.

Inflation Report:  February 2000 32 retaining only the more productive and more highly paid staff in those industries where employment was falling. There has also been a tendency for employers to increase the proportion of an individual’s pay which depends on his or her own productivity and performance.  Any combination of these four options would have led to increased wage drift, as measured by the difference between AEI growth and settlements. In January, the Bank’s regional Agents asked around 270 of their business contacts to comment on the prospects for pay in 2000.  Among the 85% of those questioned who had a company-wide settlement policy, the most commonly held view was that the settlement would be about the same as last year, though more thought it would be lower than thought it would be higher.  The same was not true of the percentage change in total pay: on balance, respondents felt this was more likely to be higher this year.  The single most important influence on pay was reported to be the need to recruit and retain staff. 3.3 Summary Employment has continued to rise, but not as rapidly as output.  Evidence on unemployment is mixed, but the trend is probably flat to falling.  These changes in quantities have been associated with some increase in reported skill shortages across most regions.  Earnings growth is still around 5%, which is stronger than had been expected three months ago.  Settlements, an important part of earnings growth, have fallen slightly, to around 31/2%.  So estimated wage drift is substantial. The first few months of any year are an important time for pay settlements.  A number of firms report that these could be lower this year than last year.  Nevertheless, the necessity to recruit and retain staff is likely to remain a significant factor in determining growth in total pay.  33 Costs and prices 4 Chart 4.1 Implied distribution for oil prices(a)(b) 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 Expectations as at cob 9 February 2000 $ per barrel 0 1997 98 99 2000 RPIX inflation remained constant at 2.2% in the last three months of 1999, below the government’s 21/2% target.  Retail goods and services price inflation have diverged further:  services price inflation has risen to 3.9%, while goods price inflation has fallen to 0.3%. Commodity price rises, notably for oil, have put  upward pressure on producer input prices, which  have increased sharply in recent months.  Producer output price inflation has also risen but remains low. Strong competitive pressures and the appreciation of the  sterling effective exchange rate have continued to  put downward pressure on producer and retail  goods price inflation.  Measures of domestically generated inflation have fallen, but remain in the 21/2%–4% range. 4.1 Raw materials and commodity prices World prices for crude oil have risen further since the November Report to their highest level since 1991.  The one-month forward price of Brent crude oil averaged more than $25 per barrel in January.  Oil prices have been underpinned by restrictions on production, which were renewed by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in September.  These are due to be reviewed at the end of March.  Oil prices have also been supported by the improved prospects for world demand, particularly the strong recovery in Asia, which is a relatively intensive user of primary commodities. Oil futures prices may contain useful information about the expected future spot price.(1) Futures prices indicate that the price of oil is expected to decline over the course of this year.  That may partly reflect expectations that non-OPEC oil producers will increase supplies.  But a range of outcomes is possible, as illustrated by the  risk-neutral probability distribution of oil prices derived from futures prices, shown in Chart 4.1.  The increasing width of the distribution illustrates that the market is more uncertain about prospects for oil prices further ahead in time.  But it is possible to abstract from this  ‘time-to-maturity’ effect and see how the implied distribution for oil prices a fixed number of months (1) See for example, Fama, E, and French, K, ‘Commodity futures prices: some evidence on forecast power, premiums, and the theory of storage’, Journal of Business, January 1987, pages 55–73.

(b) The chart depicts the probability distributions for oil prices, and is rather like a contour map. At any given point, the depth of shading represents the height of the probability density function implied by the markets over a range of outcomes for oil prices. The markets judge that there is a 10% chance of oil prices being within the darkest, central band at any date.  Each successive pair of bands covers a further 10% of the distribution until 90% of the distribution is covered.  The bands widen as the time horizon is extended, indicating increased uncertainty about oil price outcomes.

During the second half of 1999, uncertainty about the oil price six months ahead increased, but has since stabilised.  The positive skew indicates that the market assesses the balance of risks to future oil prices to be on the upside, but slightly less so than at the beginning of 1999, before oil prices rose. Consistent with the information from oil futures prices, the MPC has assumed in its central projection that the Brent oil price will decline to around $18 per barrel by the start of 2002. Non-oil commodity prices are also higher than expected at the time of the November Report.  In December the Bank’s index of sterling non-oil commodity prices was 3.7% higher than a year earlier.  The prices of hard commodities such as metals and non-oil fuels have risen since the beginning of 1999, as world industrial production has picked up (see Chart 4.3).  The prices of soft commodities such as food and other agricultural products remain well below their levels a year earlier, although they rose slightly in November and December. Soft commodity prices are also likely to have been affected by stronger world economic activity, but in addition they have been affected by weather-related supply shocks.  Reflecting the stronger outlook for world growth, the Committee now assumes a faster increase in non-oil commodity prices in 2000, with some slowdown thereafter. 4.2 Import prices and the exchange rate Sterling import prices of goods and services in 1999 Q3 were 0.3% lower than in the previous quarter, and 1.9% lower than a year earlier.  Within the total, services import prices fell by 0.8% in Q3, whereas goods import prices were flat.  Even excluding oil, import prices for goods have stabilised, despite the appreciation of the sterling effective exchange rate in 1999 (see Chart 4.4). Higher oil and other commodity prices are beginning to push up world producer prices.  But world export  prices were weaker than expected in Q3, as a sharp decline in Japanese export prices offset increases in other countries.  Japanese manufacturers have reduced local currency prices in response to the appreciation of the yen. Consistent with the upturn in global activity, the MPC’s central projection assumes that world export price (1) For a discussion of the technique, see Clews, R, Panigirtzoglou, N and Proudman, J, ‘Recent developments in extracting information from options markets’, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, February 2000, pages 50–60.

However, the weaker-than-expected outturn in 1999 Q3 and further appreciation of the sterling effective exchange rate mean that the profile of sterling import prices is somewhat lower than assumed in November. 4.3 Costs and prices in manufacturing Manufacturers’ input prices have continued to rise sharply.  The annual rate of inflation reached 12.0% in December.  A year earlier prices had fallen by 8.9%. That turnaround mainly reflects the direct pass-through to manufacturers of the rise in crude oil prices, which more than doubled in the year to December.  But more recently there has also been an increase in the price of imported metals and chemicals, in particular of plastics (see Chart 4.5), reflecting the increase in hard commodity prices and the importance of oil as an input to the chemicals sector.  The CIPS manufacturing survey continued to indicate rising input prices:  the input price index rose from an average of 51.5 in Q3 to 55.7 in Q4, well above the no-change level of 50.  The survey suggested that the rate of increase had been moderated by the appreciation of sterling. Manufacturers’ unit labour costs have fallen since the beginning of 1999.  In November, unit labour costs were estimated to be 0.8% lower than a year before:  measured productivity growth has risen sharply in recent months, as output growth has risen, more than outweighing a rise in wage growth.  But this has not been sufficient to offset the effect of higher material and fuel prices:  overall cost inflation in the manufacturing sector has increased in recent months (see Table 4.A). Manufacturers’ domestic output prices have also risen recently, even excluding petroleum products:  excluding food, beverages, tobacco and petroleum, the three-month annualised rate of output price inflation reached 1.6% in December.  The CBI monthly industrial trends survey still suggests that most manufacturing firms expect to reduce their prices in the coming months, but the balance has become less negative since February 1999 (see  Chart 4.6). Though domestic output prices have risen, the rate of increase has remained below that in weighted costs. That suggests that manufacturers have continued to reduce their domestic margins.  The outlook for manufacturers’ output prices will partly depend on how firms adjust their margins.

And the January CIPS survey indicated that suppliers’ delivery times had lengthened for the sixth successive month.  The Bank’s regional Agents have, however, continued to report downward pressure on manufacturers’ margins in recent months. 4.4 Costs and prices in the service sector In contrast to the decline in the manufacturing sector, unit labour costs in the service sector are estimated to have risen by more than 4% in the year to 1999 Q3.  And the CIPS service sector survey indicated that input cost inflation had increased in recent months:  the input price index rose from an average of 54.5 in Q3 to 57.9 in Q4, with firms citing higher wage inflation as a significant factor.  While competitive pressures were reported to have been important in containing selling prices, the survey’s measure of prices charged also increased in Q4, rising above the no-change index level of 50 (see Table 4.B).  The BCC survey also indicated that services output price inflation picked up in 1999 Q4. 4.5 Retail prices The rate of retail price inflation excluding mortgage interest payments (RPIX) has remained below the government’s 21/2% target since the November Report (see Chart 4.7).  But RPI inflation has risen, to 1.8% in December, as the effects of earlier declines in mortgage interest rates have dropped out of the calculation.  The most recent rises in official interest rates will also tend to raise RPI inflation relative to RPIX inflation. While RPIX inflation remained constant at 2.2% in the last three months of 1999, the gap between goods and services price inflation increased (see Chart 4.8).  In December this gap was at its widest since  September 1992.  Retail services price inflation rose from 3.6% in September to 3.9% in December.  Annual inflation in the cost of car insurance rose, and contributed 0.3 percentage points to annual RPIX inflation in December.  But, consistent with survey evidence on service sector output prices, other components of retail services price inflation also rose.

Over the past year the price of road fuel has risen sharply, contributing 0.7 percentage points to annual RPIX inflation in December, but the prices of many other retail goods are falling.  There are some important sector-specific effects.  The decline of 6% in the price of motor vehicles made the largest negative contribution (0.35 percentage points) to annual RPIX inflation in December (see Chart 4.9).  That reflects a fall in second-hand car prices, as new car prices do not enter the RPI.  But second-hand car prices may have been affected by expectations about the consequences of the Competition Commission inquiry into new car retailing (see the box on pages 16–17).  The contribution of non-seasonal food price inflation fell between March and October 1999, possibly reflecting an increase in the degree of competition between supermarkets.  But non-seasonal food prices rose slightly in November and December. The decline in retail goods price inflation could also be indicative of an increase in the degree of price competition in the retail sector more broadly.  New technology, such as the Internet, may be enabling new firms with lower unit costs to enter the retail market. That technology may also have lowered the cost to consumers of searching across different retailers to obtain alternative prices.  If, as a result, consumer demand has become more price-sensitive, then we might expect to see a decline in retailers’ margins.  During the period of adjustment to a lower level of unit costs, or margins, retail price inflation may decline temporarily. It is extremely difficult to assess movements in aggregate retailers’ margins.  Bank estimates suggest that retailers’ weighted costs in 1999 Q3 were almost unchanged relative to a year ago, while retail goods prices (excluding indirect taxes) have fallen.  That suggests that aggregate retailers’ margins may have declined relative to a year ago.  But at present it is not possible to identify from official data a significant structural change in the relationship between retail prices and costs. Surveys may contain some information about the prospects for retail margins.  The balance of retailers in the CBI distributive trades survey expecting to raise prices fell to -1 in November, the lowest since the survey began in 1983 (see Chart 4.10).  By contrast, the CBI quarterly industrial trends survey indicates that fewer manufacturers are expecting to reduce prices.  That may indicate downward pressure on retail margins in the near Chart 4.10 Retailers’ and manufacturers’ selling price expectations 40 20 0 20 40 60 80 100 1987 89 91 93 95 97 99 Percentage balance Manufacturers (b) Retailers (a)  + – Source:  CBI.

Looking forward, if the impact of lower retail margins on profits is expected to be significant, we might see some effect on retailers’ share prices.   Chart 4.11 shows that in recent months, retailers’ share prices have fallen considerably relative to the market as a whole and, indeed, in absolute terms as well. The MPC has maintained its assumption that the prospective increase in competitive pressures is rather more widespread than has been observed in the past. The Committee has therefore assumed that there will be some overall compression of retailers’ margins over the forecast period, which will put downward pressure on retail prices.  The Committee has also maintained the assumption that there will be substantial reductions in the prices of some services provided by utilities following decisions by the relevant regulatory bodies. 4.6 Other price indices Retail price inflation can be thought of as a weighted average of domestically generated inflation (DGI) and imported inflation.  It is apparent from Chart 4.12 that the weakness of import prices, especially in sterling terms following the appreciation of the exchange rate, has continued to exert downward pressure on retail price inflation.  DGI provides some information on the pressure being exerted on prices by domestic demand. One measure of DGI is based on the GDP deflator. Annual inflation of the GDP deflator was revised up significantly in the latest set of National Accounts, from 1.7% to 2.4% in 1999 Q3 (see Chart 4.13).  That largely reflected upward revisions to the household and government consumption deflators.  The revisions to  the household consumption deflator were mainly accounted for by new data on rents.  Data on rents are used by the ONS to estimate the imputed rents for owner-occupied housing, a component of nominal consumer spending. The revisions aligned the GDP deflator measure of DGI (excluding export prices) more closely with the other measures (see Chart 4.14).  These suggest that domestic inflationary pressures eased during the first three quarters of 1999, but remain in the 21/2%–4% range. The economy is not only subject to external shocks: individual products and services are continually affected by changes in technology and consumer preferences. These will cause relative prices to change.

Costs and prices 39 movements in relative prices may obscure underlying developments in inflation.  It is therefore useful to look at measures of inflation that remove such large price changes from the sample.  The Bank calculates a measure of inflation that excludes the largest and smallest 15% of weighted price changes in the individual components of the retail price index.  This trimmed mean measure of RPIX inflation has remained at 1.6% for the past five months. Annual inflation in the UK Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) is now below that in the euro area, standing at 1.2% in December (see Chart 4.15). HICP inflation in the United Kingdom was above that in the euro area over the past three years, but consumer price inflation in the euro area has risen in recent months. The increase partly reflects the depreciation of the euro effective exchange rate in 1999, as well as higher oil and non-oil commodity prices.      4.7 Summary Oil and non-oil commodity prices have risen further, putting upward pressure on producers’ input costs, but the appreciation of the sterling effective exchange rate has continued to moderate the impact on UK producer and retail goods price inflation.  An increase in the degree of competition between firms may have added to downward pressure on goods price inflation.  Retail goods and services price inflation have diverged further in recent months:  a decline in retail goods price inflation has been offset by a rise in retail services price inflation. RPIX inflation remained at 2.2% in the last three months of 1999, below the government’s 21/2% target.

The minutes of the November, December and January meetings are attached as an Annex to this Report.  The Bank of England’s repo rate was maintained at 5.5% in December, and was raised to 5.75% in January.  In February it was raised to 6%. In the November Report, the MPC’s central projection was for annual real GDP growth in the 2.5%–3% range during 2000 and 2001, higher than in 1999.  The Committee’s best collective judgment of the prospects for RPIX inflation was that it was most likely to decline to just below 2% by the end of 2000, before rising to the 21/2% target level in late 2001.  Changes relative to the August projection reflected upward pressure on inflation from stronger domestic demand and higher earnings, and downward pressure from the higher exchange rate and declining price-cost margins.  There were considerable uncertainties surrounding inflation prospects, for example about the future course of the exchange rate, earnings and margins.  Alternative judgments on these issues led some Committee members to prefer profiles for inflation that would be up to 1/2% higher or lower at the two-year forecast horizon than the central projection representing the best collective judgment. At its meeting on 8–9 December, the Committee discussed new information relating to the world economy.  US output growth continued to appear robust, with a major contribution coming from strong consumption growth.  This was supported partly by strong equity prices, though there was a continued downside risk of an equity market correction.  Data revisions had made the recent GDP trend in Japan hard to discern, but the level of output in Q3 appeared to be broadly as expected at the time of the November Report. Activity in the rest of the industrial world, including the euro area, was either as expected or slightly firmer, as was news from emerging market economies. UK final domestic demand in Q3 had turned out to be broadly as expected at the time of the November Report, though consumption had been stronger and investment weaker than expected.  The interpretation of the  Monetary policy since the November Report 41 consumption data was made more difficult by the changing seasonal pattern of car purchases resulting from changes in the timing of the introduction of new registration letters.  Data for money and household credit suggested that consumer spending would remain robust. Notes and coin growth was particularly strong, but temporary special factors relating to the millennium date change were probably at work.  Asset prices were also likely to underpin consumption growth: the FTSE  All-Share index was up by 9% since the November Report and annual house price inflation was above 10% on most measures.  With regard to investment, it was considered likely that the data might be revised up, but there was also a possibility that the recent slowdown partly reflected a ‘millennium pause’ in IT-related investment spending. There was little news in UK labour market data since the November meeting.  However, the Bank’s regional Agents reported that there was more widespread evidence of skill shortages.  Some of the Agents’ contacts had also expressed concern about prospects for the coming pay round.  But such reports were not yet supported by evidence from other sources.  The Committee had insufficient new evidence to determine whether earnings growth was diverging markedly from the November central projection.  There were, however, signs that productivity in manufacturing had picked up, though this rise in productivity would need to be more widespread if potential higher earnings growth and demand pressures were not to lead eventually to higher inflation. The main news on commodity prices was a sharp rise in the price of oil in November.  This came on top of rises earlier in the year, which were contributing to a substantial rise in producer input prices.  However, the short-term prospects for UK retail price inflation seemed little changed, owing to offsetting effects from the higher exchange rate, lower margins (partly associated with greater competition) and lower utility prices.  Downward pressures on goods price inflation were especially strong, and the gap between goods price and service price inflation had widened further. The Committee discussed whether there were any special tactical considerations affecting monetary policy arising from Y2K considerations.  Uncertainties about the size of millennium-related effects might make it more difficult than usual to interpret economic data. However, it was considered that the year-end ‘fog’ might  Inflation Report:  February 2000 42 not be that much thicker than usual, and that millennium factors should not rule out an interest rate change in December or January if that were warranted. With regard to the immediate policy decision, there were two broad views within the Committee.  Proponents of one view favoured no change, while supporters of the other favoured an immediate rise of 25 basis points. Those who favoured no change in rates took the view that there was insufficient news to change the stance adopted in November, or thought that although  medium-term risks might have increased slightly, the short-term prospects for inflation were at least as weak as in the November projection, so that further tightening could not be justified.  It was thought sensible to wait for more information to emerge before taking any further action.  The case for a rise was partly based on the assessment that the news over the month increased the likelihood of higher inflation beyond the short run. World demand prospects had improved and UK consumption was looking stronger than expected.  The November projection had anyway been for a rising inflation profile at the two-year horizon.  On this view, the risks of a monetary policy mistake were mainly on the upside.  The Committee voted to maintain the Bank’s repo rate at 5.5%. At its meeting on 12–13 January, the Committee again discussed news about the progress of the world economy since the November Report.  Activity in Asia (other than Japan) and the euro area had strengthened perceptibly, and the euro area was the single most important market for UK exports.  US GDP growth had remained very strong in Q3 and consumer confidence had risen to a  30-year high.  The US labour market continued to be tight, but there were few signs that higher oil and other commodity prices had been passed through to US retail prices.  Higher equity prices may have been reflecting assessments of higher growth prospects, but it remained possible that the stock market was overvalued.  The downside risks from a potential stock market correction and from a disorderly adjustment to the growing US trade deficit, for example via a potential fall in the dollar, remained significant.  But these risks had been present for some time, and there was not much new information on these issues.  Overall, the outlook for world economic growth was now stronger than it had been at the time of the November Report. In the December National Accounts release, the level of UK GDP in 1999 Q3 was much as expected in the November Report, but the pattern and composition of  Monetary policy since the November Report 43 growth in the previous quarters had altered a little. Growth in 1998 Q4 had been revised down, but figures for the first two quarters of 1999 had been revised up. Manufacturing and industrial production grew faster in Q3 than service sector output, but it was possible that the relative slowdown in service sector growth—observed particularly in financial and business services—was partly millennium-related.  Final domestic demand growth had slowed somewhat in Q3, but net external demand had picked up considerably in Q2 and Q3. Consumer spending prospects—as indicated by disposable income growth, wealth increases and consumer confidence—seemed to be for robust growth. This assessment was also supported by data on lending for consumption (unsecured lending to individuals plus mortgage equity withdrawal), which had shown a sharp rise.  Narrow money had also grown strongly, very probably on account of abnormal millennium-related effects at the year-end, which the Committee expected to unwind during January with no implications for activity or inflation. UK employment had continued to increase and unemployment had fallen further, but most of the accounting counterpart of the increase in employment seemed to have come from a fall in inactivity.  The Bank’s regional Agents continued to report increases in skill shortages in some areas, but the Committee recalled that the October CBI survey indicated that skilled labour shortages in manufacturing remained below historical averages.  Forward-looking survey evidence suggested further moderate growth in employment in the near term. Overall, the evidence seemed to be of continued tightness and perhaps further tightening of the labour market.  The headline measure of whole-economy earnings growth had risen to 4.9% in the year to October, above the level expected, hence the Committee considered that the earnings profile projected in November might need to be raised.  It was possible that there were some erratic influences on the latest data, but continued high levels of earnings growth would tend to put upward pressure on inflation if not matched by a significant pick-up in productivity growth. RPIX growth had remained below target in November, despite the growth in earnings and higher commodity prices (especially oil).  Part of the explanation was the strength of sterling, but downward pressure on prices due to greater competitive forces might also have been a factor.  There was a range of views about how large and how long-lasting such effects might be.  Inflation Report:  February 2000 44 The Committee returned to the issue of whether millennium considerations should influence the monetary policy decision.  It was noted that it might be some time before all the distortions to the data were unwound.  But such distortions as there were did not seem to be that large relative to normal data uncertainty around the year-end, and there was no strong argument for avoiding a change in monetary policy stance if new information pointed to the need for such a change. On the immediate policy decision, it seemed clear that the balance of news for prospective medium-term inflation over the past month was on the upside, even though final domestic demand growth had recently slowed and RPIX inflation was below target and seemed likely to remain so for some time.  Growth prospects had improved for the United Kingdom’s main trading partners, and the determinants of domestic demand, such as wealth, labour income and consumer borrowing, were also looking buoyant.  The deterioration in medium-term inflation prospects reflected developing pressures in the labour market and on productive capacity.  All members of the Committee were of the view that higher interest rates were now needed. The Committee voted to increase the Bank’s repo rate from 5.5% to 5.75%. At its meeting on 9–10 February, the Committee voted to raise the Bank’s repo rate from 5.75% to 6%.  45 Prospects for inflation 6 6.1 The inflation projection assumptions The Committee approved this Report on 11 February.   It contains the Committee’s assessment of developments in the economy since November and prospects for the medium term.  Charts 6.1 and 6.2 below show projections for GDP growth and RPIX inflation up to two years ahead, and the uncertainties surrounding them. The projections assume that the Bank’s repo interest  rate will remain unchanged at 6% during the next two years, and are conditioned on the assumptions described below. There has been a further improvement in the prospects for world activity since the November Report.  Output growth in the United States in the second half of 1999 exceeded expectations, and the near-term outlook remains strong.  The Committee continues to expect a slowdown in US output growth over the next two years, although there remains considerable uncertainty on its timing and magnitude.  Output growth in the euro area has picked up more quickly than expected in November. Forward-looking indicators, such as business confidence and orders, have risen further, supporting the recovery built into the projection.  Recent indicators on the Japanese economy have been mixed, but have not significantly altered the broad outlook.  There has been a further pick-up in activity in a number of emerging market economies, and prospects have improved over the past three months.  Trade flows, within Asia in particular, have risen sharply in recent months.  Taking these developments together, the MPC has made a further upward revision to its central projection for world output and trade.  The most likely outcome is that growth in UK-weighted export markets will rise from around 51/2% in 1999 to around 71/2% this year, before falling back a little in 2001. There remain a number of risks to the world outlook  and, while the central projection for world activity has been raised since November, the Committee continues  to judge that the risks around this projection are weighted to the downside.  A sharper-than-expected slowdown in the United States poses the largest  risk.  Inflation Report:  February 2000 46 Commodity prices have, on balance, been higher than projected at the time of the November Report.  Oil prices have been higher than assumed earlier, as market conditions have tightened further.  The pick-up in  non-oil commodity prices in the final quarter of last  year was also somewhat stronger than projected in November, as food prices rose for the first time in more than two years.  However, stronger-than-expected commodity prices have not been translated into a  larger-than-expected increase in output prices.  Indeed, reflecting a continuation of strong competition in global markets, prices of manufactured goods and traded services in the third quarter of 1999 were slightly weaker in local currency terms than projected in November. The Committee expects these competitive pressures to persist, and the outlook for world inflation is little changed from November, despite the improved outlook for world activity and higher oil prices.  The projected oil price profile for the next two years has been raised, reflecting recent higher outturns, although the central assumption is that the oil price gradually falls back from current levels to around $18 per barrel for Brent crude oil—the same level as at the end of the November projection—by the first quarter of 2002.  Reflecting the stronger outlook for world growth, the Committee now assumes a faster rise in non-oil commodity prices this year.  Rising commodity prices are likely to feed through to higher world prices of manufactured goods and traded services, which are expected to rise in line with the rates of increase projected at the time of the November Report.  But, reflecting the lower starting-point, the projected level of world export prices is lower than assumed in November.  The risks around the projection for world prices are broadly neutral.  There is a downside risk given the risk of weaker world activity. But this is counterbalanced by an upside risk should the recent unexpected weakness in world export prices prove to be temporary. The outlook for UK import prices will be affected by the sterling exchange rate, as well as by the prospects for world prices.  The sterling exchange rate has strengthened appreciably over the past three months. The effective exchange rate index (ERI) averaged 109.4 in the 15 working days up to and including 9 February. This forms the starting-point for the exchange rate profile assumed in the projection.  It compares with a starting-point of 105.6 at the time of the November Report and an implied level of 105.1 for February in the November central projection.  Prospects for inflation 47 All Committee members agree that there is considerable uncertainty about the outlook for the exchange rate.(1) As in the November Report, the Committee agreed to take the average of a constant nominal rate and a path related to the pattern of market interest rate differentials as the basis for the central projection.  On this assumption, and adjusting for the conditioning assumption of constant interest rates, the sterling ERI declines to 107.1 by the end of the two-year forecast period, consistent with bilateral sterling exchange rates of $1.63 and 0.63 against the euro (equivalent to DM3.05).  That is a more gradual decline than in November.  Some members took comfort that a forecast implied by a recently estimated econometric model of the exchange rate gave a broadly similar profile to the central projection.  If, alternatively, the central projection were based on the assumption that the exchange rate moves in line with interest rate differentials, inflation at the two-year horizon would be some 0.3 percentage points higher than in the central projection.  GDP growth would also be rather stronger. On the other hand, basing the projection on a constant nominal exchange rate would lower inflation by some 0.3 percentage points at the two-year horizon, and growth would be weaker. Changes in equity prices affect households’ wealth and companies’ cost of capital.  Equity prices have risen further in the past three months.  In the 15 working days up to 9 February, the FTSE All-Share index was some 6% higher than in the equivalent period three months ago.  The Committee has maintained the central assumption that equity prices will rise in line with nominal GDP over the forecast period. Household wealth is also affected by changes in house prices.  Over the past three months, house prices nationally have risen more rapidly than previously expected, although there are some tentative signs in the activity data that the market may be stabilising.  House price inflation is likely to slow, as recent increases in interest rates feed through.  The Committee has revised up slightly the assumption for house price inflation.  The central assumption is that house price inflation moderates to below 10% this year, and eases further in 2001. The fiscal plans announced by the Chancellor in the autumn pre-Budget statement on 9 November have been (1) See the box on page 48 of the November 1999 Inflation Report for a discussion of alternative benchmarks for assessing exchange rate prospects.  Inflation Report:  February 2000 48 incorporated into the latest projection.  Given the Government’s announced plans for nominal spending and the Committee’s latest central projection for inflation, the likely growth rate for real government consumption is a little lower than assumed by the Committee in November. Previous projections have already incorporated assumptions about the effects of the National Minimum Wage, the New Deal and the Working Time Directive. There is no change to the assumptions about the effects of these labour market reforms. 6.2 The output and inflation projections Output growth strengthened in the second half of 1999. According to the preliminary ONS estimate, GDP rose by 0.8% in the fourth quarter—a similar pace to the third quarter.  The four-quarter growth rate quickened to 2.7%, a little above most estimates of the sustainable rise in supply capacity.  The pick-up in growth was broadly in line with expectations in the November Report, although there have been revisions to the pattern of output and to the composition of demand which may convey information on the near-term outlook.  RPIX inflation has remained below target in recent months. Inflation averaged 2.2% in the fourth quarter, in line with the central projection in the November Report.  The Committee reviewed the medium-term prospects for output and inflation against this background. The full National Accounts release published in December indicated that the level of GDP in the third quarter was in line with the preliminary estimate incorporated in the November projections.  The pattern of growth over the previous year was revised, however, with the new data indicating a more pronounced pause in activity at the end of 1998, followed by a rather stronger recovery in early 1999.  The data release also incorporated revisions to the composition of demand.  In particular, final domestic demand was revised down as new information suggested that consumer spending had grown somewhat less robustly than previously estimated, and this outweighed an upward revision to the level of business investment.  The downward revision to final domestic demand was offset by a rather stronger net trade position than previously estimated and by an upward revision to inventories. The National Accounts release also signalled some improvement in the balance of demand and activity in recent months.  The annual growth of final domestic  Prospects for inflation 49 demand now appears to be in the 3%–31/2% range, still above a sustainable pace, but slower than the 4%–41/2% rate suggested in previous estimates for the first  half-year.  The deterioration in the net trade position has, perhaps temporarily, slowed—indeed, in the second and third quarters net trade made a positive contribution to growth.  Moreover, the run-down of inventories, which had dampened growth in the first half of the year, has ended.  The balance of output growth has also improved somewhat.  Aggregate manufacturing output picked up in the second half of 1999, and may now be rising close to rates in the service sector.  Nonetheless, the overall picture masks significant differences across industrial sectors, and the further strengthening of sterling in recent months will dampen prospective growth in those industries most heavily exposed to international competition. Consumer spending remains robust.  Although the level of spending was revised down in the latest release, expenditure was 31/2% higher in the third quarter than a year earlier.  The underlying strength may be greater if consumers are deferring spending on cars until the outcome of the Competition Commission report on the car market is known.  New car registrations have been very weak in recent months, although the underlying trend is also obscured by the new pattern of registration letter changes.  Spending on other consumer goods remains firm.  Retail sales rose by well over 1% in the fourth quarter.  Moreover, indicators of prospective spending are buoyant.  Real income growth is strong, household wealth has risen sharply in recent months, consumer confidence has improved further, and the money and credit data support a robust spending outlook. In reviewing the outlook for consumption, the Committee assigned weight to evidence suggesting that changes in wealth had a larger short-term impact on spending than previously thought.  Drawing on this evidence, and given the higher-than-expected increases in wealth and labour income, the Committee has revised up the near-term profile for consumer spending relative to the November Report.  Annual growth rates may remain in the 3%–31/2% range for much of 2000.  But spending growth is then expected to lose momentum, as wealth and labour income growth slow in response to  the recent increases in interest rates and to the impact  of the higher real exchange rate on activity and employment.  Consumer expenditure growth may consequently be rather weaker in 2001 than in the November projection.    Inflation Report:  February 2000 50 There was a marked slowdown in the growth of business investment in 1999, although the level of spending has been revised up over the past two years.  Indeed, business investment spending fell in the third quarter, for the first time since 1996.  The slowdown follows several years of very rapid growth, partly linked to heavy investment in IT-related equipment.  The recent slower growth of investment may signal that the gap between firms’ actual capital stock and desired levels has narrowed.  In that event, and in the absence of a major change in prospective growth or in the cost of capital, the ratio of business investment volumes to GDP might level off at around current levels.  This assumption is consistent with the recent investment pattern and is incorporated in the central projection.  Around this broad trend, the Committee also attached weight to reports from the Bank’s Agents that part of the recent slowdown might reflect a temporary pause in IT-related spending in 1999, if companies were cautious about making new investment before the year-end once systems had been tested as year-2000 compliant.  There could be something of a rebound in 2000 as deferred investment comes on-stream.  But, overall, business investment growth is likely to be rather softer than in the November projection, reflecting the weaker recent momentum and slower overall activity growth.  Risks to business investment are weighted to the upside.  That reflects various factors.  Surveys suggest rather stronger  short-term growth.  More rapid investment in systems to support electronic commerce could stimulate faster growth in business investment than in the central case. Another risk is that growth in housing and industrial construction could be faster.  No change has been made to the government investment projection:  nominal public sector investment is assumed to rise in line with announced public spending plans.  Inventory levels were revised upwards in the latest National Accounts release, but there was no significant change to the previous quarterly pattern.  Following a substantial run-down in inventories in the first half of 1999 as firms shed excess stocks, the data for the third quarter and recent surveys suggest that stock levels are now closer to firms’ desired levels, although some inventories may have been built up for precautionary reasons prior to the millennium date change.  The Agents suggest that any such build-up was small, and that additional inventories should be quickly run off. The Committee continues to expect that firms will economise further on inventory holdings—for example by taking additional advantage of IT developments to  Prospects for inflation 51 control stock levels—and that the ratio of inventories to output will fall gradually over time. Export growth strengthened in 1999 as world trade growth recovered.  The trend in exports is hard to gauge as the data have been quite volatile.  There was a remarkable rise of 6% in export volumes in the third quarter, but recent monthly data indicate some fall back in the fourth quarter.  Surveys of export trends indicate that there has been some improvement in short-term prospects.  Exports may continue to rise more rapidly in the near term than was assumed in the November Report, stimulated by the stronger growth in UK export markets.  But faster growth in exports is likely to be temporary.  Sterling has appreciated significantly in recent months.  Moreover, overseas competitors’ export prices in local currency terms are lower than assumed in November, adding to competitive pressures on UK exporters.  Export growth is likely to slow as sales adjust to the higher real exchange rate.  The medium-term outlook for exports is weaker than in November as a result. Import volumes also strengthened markedly in the third quarter.  It is possible that weaker import growth earlier in the year was associated with the inventory cycle: firms may have temporarily reduced demand for imports in order to meet a proportion of final demand by running down stocks.  Import growth has recovered as the inventory correction came to an end.  Import volume growth is likely to remain strong over the next two years, supported by robust consumer spending growth in the near term and by the higher sterling exchange rate. Taking exports and imports together, the outlook for net trade is weaker than in the November projection.  The further rise in the sterling exchange rate, together with the lower profile for competitors’ export prices, outweighs the upward revision to UK export market growth.  The current account deficit is likely to widen as import growth outstrips that of exports. Business surveys and information from contacts of the Bank’s regional Agents are consistent with a continuing improvement in output in the near term.  Demand for labour remains firm, although employment growth has slowed a little.  Unemployment is at its lowest for  20 years.  Some of the recent growth in employment has been accounted for by a reduction in inactivity, as an improving labour market has encouraged greater numbers to seek work.  There are signs in both surveys  Inflation Report:  February 2000 52 and Agents’ reports that skilled labour shortages have increased over the past quarter, although in the case of the CBI survey for manufacturing the rise is only to the long-run historical average. Drawing these elements together, the central projection for four-quarter GDP growth is shown in Chart 6.1.(1) The momentum in growth is fuelled by buoyant final domestic demand.  Nonetheless, the pace of overall GDP growth may slow a little from above-trend rates in the coming quarters, as the effects of the higher real exchange rate and monetary policy tightening work through.  Four-quarter growth is likely to settle in the 21/4%–21/2% range over the next two years.  The outlook is a little softer than in the November projection. Although higher income and wealth will spur more rapid consumer spending growth in the near term, the stimulus will be more than outweighed over the next two years by the impact of the higher exchange rate and past interest rate increases. Recent Inflation Reports have highlighted the considerable uncertainty surrounding the short-term links between activity and inflation.  It was noted in both the August and November Reports that output growth had strengthened more quickly in early 1999 than previously estimated by the Committee, while at the same time RPIX inflation outturns had been lower than earlier projected.  Interpreting the evidence on the links between activity and inflation remains difficult.  Over the past three months, output growth and inflation have been broadly in line with the November central projection, but this has provided little information on the likely relationship over the next two years.  A wide range of factors can influence the link, for example: global price trends;  exchange rate prospects;  labour cost pressures;  and developments in profit margins and pricing behaviour more generally, as well as the likely path for output and demand pressure.  And, of course, central to the projections is an assessment of the monetary policy stance, which ultimately determines the rate of inflation in the medium term.  The Committee reviewed the recent evidence on these various influences and reconsidered the forecast assumptions. Monetary indicators provide mixed signals on the outlook.  Aggregate broad money growth remains weak. But that probably conveys little information on overall prospects:  recent movements in the aggregate continue to be dominated by falls in deposits held by other Chart 6.1 Current GDP projection based on constant nominal interest rates at 6% The fan chart depicting the probability distribution for output growth  is rather like a contour map.

Prospects for inflation 53 financial corporations which have little direct link with nominal spending.  Excluding this component, annual broad money growth appears stable.  Household credit data show greater strength, and corroborate the buoyant near-term outlook for consumer spending.  Total lending to individuals has risen by more than 9% in the past year, the fastest increase since the early 1990s.  Narrow money growth also picked up in 1999, consistent with a pick-up in retail sales growth:  recent data have, however, been distorted by swings in cash holdings over the millennium date change.  Monetary policy has tightened since November, with the Bank’s repo rate up by 50 basis points.  The increase in short-term rates was a little above market expectations three months ago, and longer-term yields have increased a little since the November Report. Although pay settlements are fairly stable and if anything drifting down, nominal earnings growth has edged up in recent months, and the latest outturns for earnings are stronger than expected three months ago.   A number of factors may account for the rise in wage drift, including higher merit awards and bonuses as firms pay more to retain and recruit staff, a change in  the overtime trend as activity recovers, and a change in the composition of the labour force towards  higher-skilled workers.  There are some indications from contacts of the Bank’s regional Agents that job losses in manufacturing industry over the past year have been disproportionately weighted towards lower-skilled and lower-paid workers, and also that firms taking on new staff have sometimes had to pay a premium over existing pay rates.   The Committee has revised up the path for nominal earnings growth since the November forecast.  The stronger-than-expected outturns in recent months suggest rather greater momentum than previously envisaged.  Future nominal earnings growth may also be supported by a rather stronger profits position than expected three months ago.  Since the November Report there has been a significant upward revision to estimates of the share of profits in national income in recent quarters.  The stronger profit position could indicate that firms will be less resistant to upward pressure on real wages than expected in November.  There are signs in the latest data that labour productivity growth is strengthening, especially in manufacturing. The improvement is in line with the cyclical recovery projected in November.  The Committee continues to  Inflation Report:  February 2000 54 expect that labour productivity growth will return to its long-run historical average trend over the next two years.  Stronger productivity growth acts to dampen upward pressures on costs, for example from faster growth in earnings. Productivity growth is a key determinant of the supply potential of the economy.  Faster productivity growth on a sustained basis would raise the trend growth rate. Estimating the long-term trend growth rate is difficult. Productivity growth varies over the economic cycle and is hard to measure.  It is difficult to separate changes in the long-run trend from variations over the cycle and from normal random fluctuations and measurement error.  The Committee consequently places emphasis on empirical trends as the best guide to estimating  long-term productive potential, but is alert to any evidence of structural change.  Over the past 40 years, labour productivity in the United Kingdom has risen by around 2% per annum.  That remains the central projection for the long-term trend. The November projection incorporated a number of adjustments to the inflation outlook, reflecting the possibility that there may be a further compression of price-cost margins in a number of sectors, which could have a temporary impact on inflation as the adjustment to a lower level of margins takes place.  Although equity prices overall have risen, the share prices of UK retailers have fallen sharply over the past year, consistent with a weaker outlook for retail profitability and the possibility of a compression of price-cost margins.  The share prices of utilities have also declined substantially, as regulators have announced substantial cuts in prospective prices.   The best collective judgment is that these adjustments should be increased a little in the February projection. Competitive pressures in some sectors, such as cars, appear to be intensifying more rapidly than judged three months ago.  Although there is considerable uncertainty surrounding both the magnitude and duration of the potential impact of such developments on aggregate inflation, the adjustment in the central projection assumes that these effects take place throughout the forecast period, reducing inflation by around  0.25 percentage points in the first year and by  0.3 percentage points in the second.  The latest evidence on utilities prices is consistent with the November Report and so the previous adjustments have been maintained in the central projection.  Prospects for inflation 55 Different Committee members prefer alternative assumptions for margins adjustments, reflecting different views on the intensification of competitive pressures and on the impact of these pressures on inflation.  Some Committee members consider that the adjustments should only affect aggregate inflation for a short period, reflecting the stickiness of prices.  These Committee members prefer a smaller adjustment to inflation on account of margin adjustments, especially in the second year.  On this view, inflation at the two-year horizon could be up to 0.3 percentage points higher than in the central projection.  Other Committee members consider that the central projection attaches insufficient weight to the possible second-round effects of lower margins on costs, with further consequent effects on prices.  They also judge that downward pressures on car prices and from expanding use of the Internet could be larger. These Committee members prefer alternative assumptions on margin pressure that would lower inflation further in the first year of the forecast, building up in the second year to leave inflation at the two-year horizon up to 0.4 percentage points lower than in the central projection. Putting the above assumptions together, the Committee’s best collective projection for the twelve-month RPIX inflation rate—based on the assumption that nominal interest rates are held constant at 6%—is shown in  Chart 6.2.(1) Alongside is the projection from the Chart 6.2 Current RPIX inflation projection based on constant nominal interest rates at 6% 0 1 2 3 4 5 1995 96 97 98 99 2000 01 Percentage increase in prices on a year earlier 2.5 02 The fan chart depicting the probability distribution for inflation is rather like a contour map.  At any given point during the forecast period, the depth of shading represents the height of the probability density function over a range of outcomes for inflation.  The darkest band includes the central (single most likely) projection and covers 10% of the probability.  Each successive pair of bands is drawn to cover a further 10% of the probability, until 90% of the probability distribution is covered.  The bands widen as the time horizon is extended, indicating increasing uncertainty about outcomes.  See the box ‘How fan charts are drawn’ on page 52 of the February 1999 Inflation Report.

Inflation Report:  February 2000 56 November Report, which was based on constant interest rates at 5.5% (see Chart 6.3). There are some changes to the shape of the inflation profile.  The central projection is for inflation to edge down a little further over the next few months as pressures on margins intensify and cuts in domestic utilities prices take effect.  The recent appreciation of the exchange rate will also press down on prices.  Inflation then starts to rise towards the target as pressures from the labour market build and as the temporary effects on measured inflation from lower domestic water and electricity prices unwind.  Inflation rises to around the target level by the middle of 2001 and then remains at around that level.  The trough in inflation is rather shallower and occurs rather earlier than in the November projection, and the rise in inflation from the trough is less steep than before.  A combination of factors accounts for this outcome.  In the near term, the impact of higher nominal earnings and unit labour cost growth is partly offset by the higher exchange rate.  But by the end of this year, stronger labour cost pressures dominate and put upward pressure on inflation relative to the November projection.  The rise is less steep thereafter as activity growth is rather softer, helping to dissipate earnings pressure, and as the effects of structural pressures on profit margins are stronger than assumed in November. Risks around the central projection for activity are weighted slightly to the upside in the first year, reflecting the possibilities of faster business investment growth, and of overseas competitors raising their export prices more quickly than projected, which would improve UK export prospects.  These more than outweigh the downside risk from a weaker world growth outlook.  But the latter risk builds over time, and implies that the overall risk to UK activity growth is weighted slightly to the downside in the second year.  Inflation risks are weighted slightly to the upside in both years.  The prospect of faster activity growth in the first year would push up inflation, and the momentum would tend to keep inflation higher in the second year, even though the risks to output growth gradually shift towards the downside. Charts 6.4 and 6.5 show the overall balance of risks to inflation at the two-year horizon.  Table 6.A presents the Committee’s best collective judgment of the probabilities of various outcomes for inflation and GDP growth. There remain a number of major uncertainties in the outlook.  On some key issues, certain Committee members prefer to make a different assumption to that Table 6.A The MPC’s expectations for RPIX inflation and GDP growth based on constant nominal interest rates at 6%(a) RPIX inflation Probability, per cent  Range: less  1.5% 2.0%  2.5%  3.0% more than  to  to  to  to  than 1.5% 2.0% 2.5% 3.0% 3.5% 3.5% 2000 Q4 10 30 35 19 5 1 2001 Q4   5 12 24 26 19 14 2002 Q1 5 12 22 25 19 17 GDP growth  Probability, per cent  Range: less  0%  1%  2%  3%  more  than  to  to  to  to  than  0% 1% 2% 3% 4% 4% 2000 Q4 <1 6 30 41 19 4 2001 Q4 2 10 27 36 20 5 2002 Q1 2 10 27 36 20 5 (a) These figures are from the same distribution as the GDP and inflation fan charts, Charts 6.1 and 6.2.  Prospects for inflation 57 incorporated in the central projection in forming their best estimate of the most likely outcome.  These judgments are not incorporated explicitly in the fan charts or in Table 6.A, but are shown in Table 6.B, which presents illustrative calibrations of the possible effects of the alternative assumptions. The alternative assumptions shown in Table 6.B are viewed by the Committee as a series of separate judgments.  The net effect of the alternative assumptions preferred by different Committee members leads to a range of views about inflation prospects, emphasising the uncertainties and difficulties in forming judgments on the outlook.  These varying assumptions could either raise or lower the inflation profile at the two-year horizon by up to a 1/2 percentage point. Market expectations of the likely future path of official interest rates are a little higher than in November. Estimates of prospective official rates based on the government bond and gilt repo curve indicate that market expectations are for official rates to rise over the next year to a peak of around 63/4% before drifting down slightly (see Table 6.C).  As a consequence, the Committee’s projections based on the assumption that official rates move in line with market expectations are for significantly weaker output growth and lower inflation than in the projections based on constant nominal rates (see Charts 6.6 and 6.7).  These projections are based on the assumption that, relative to Chart 6.4 Current projection for the percentage increase  in RPIX in the year to 2002 Q1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Probability in per cent (a) Inflation 90% probability (b) Chart 6.5 November projection for the percentage increase in RPIX in the year to 2001 Q4 0 1 2 3 4 5 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   Probability in per cent (a) Inflation 90% probability (b) 6 Source:  Bank of England.

Should the exchange rate move by less, as some Committee members judged more likely, the path for output growth and inflation would be rather higher than in Charts 6.6 and 6.7. 6.3 Other forecasts The Bank asked a sample of external forecasters for their latest projections of inflation and output.  Based on information from external forecasters surveyed in late January, the mean forecast for the twelve-month rate of RPIX inflation in 2000 Q4 was 2.2% (with a range of 1.3% to 3.6%), rising to 2.4% in 2001 Q4 (with a range of 1.7% to 3.0%), and remaining at 2.4% in 2002 Q1 (with a range of 1.9% to 2.7%).  The distribution of central projections in 2002 Q1 is shown in Chart 6.8. The estimates for 2000 and 2001 are slightly lower than the projections made at the time of the October survey. The forecasters assign a probability of around 43% to inflation being above target in the first quarter of 2002, and a probability of around 57% to it being below (see Table 6.D).  A little more weight is placed on lower outturns for inflation than in the November Report. The forecasters’ average projection for GDP growth in the year to 2000 Q4 is 23/4% (with a range of 2% to 33/4%), falling to 21/4% in the year to 2002 Q1 (with a range of 11/2% to 31/2%).  The estimates for GDP growth are little changed from the November Report.   The forecasters’ average projection for the official interest rate in 2000 Q4 is 61/2% (with a range of 53/4% to Chart 6.6 Current RPIX inflation projection based on market interest rate expectations 0 1 2 3 4 5 1995 96 97 98 99 2000 01 2.5 Percentage increase in prices on a year earlier 02 Chart 6.7 Current GDP projection based on market interest  rate expectations 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 1995 96 97 98 99 2000 01 Percentage increase in output on a year earlier + – 02 Chart 6.8 Distribution of RPIX inflation forecasts  for 2002 Q1 0.0 0.6 1.2 1.8 2.4 3.0 3.6 4.2 4.8 5.4 6.0 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 Range of forecasts Number of forecasts Source:  Forecasts of 26 outside forecasters as at 28 January 2000.

G Manufacturing output growth improved further during the period in almost all regions.  But strong growth in some sectors masked continued weak growth or contraction in others.  G Service sector growth remained strong at a steady rate during the period, in almost all regions.  The fastest growth was recorded in professional services.  G While the rate of construction growth varied considerably between locations, most Agents noted that growth had remained broadly stable in recent months.  Growth was supported by both commercial and residential activity.  G Retail spending growth strengthened, with a noticeable pick-up in annual growth reported during the Christmas period.  Sales of new and used car sales slowed further during the period.   G Export demand continued to increase, though moderately.  There was little evidence to suggest any slowing in demand from the United States, while the recoveries in Europe and East Asia progressed further.  However, contacts continued to report further import penetration. G Investment trends in the manufacturing and service sectors diverged further during the period.  Service sector investment intentions remained strong, with most plans focused on IT development.  But manufacturing investment intentions were weaker, with further pressure on margins reducing the ability of companies to invest.  In addition, there were increased reports of firms investing in capacity overseas. G There were widespread reports of increased materials prices, although these were generally confined to a few commodities.  Downward price pressure on manufacturing output prices continued, with most firms suggesting that it remained difficult to pass on any increases in costs.  There was little change in retail prices trends, with flat or falling goods prices still being reported and service price inflation remaining relatively high.  House price growth was broadly stable.   G Pay pressures in the manufacturing sector remained subdued in most regions, with most settlements similar  to or lower than a year ago.  Settlements in the services sector were similar to or slightly stronger than in the previous period, although there was much more variability.  Agents noted that the use of bonus payments  and non-pay rewards, such as share options, to remunerate staff had increased compared with the previous period. G Labour market conditions tightened further, with skill shortages noted as a serious concern in the southern regions of the United Kingdom.  Moderate service sector employment growth continued in most regions. Employment conditions in the manufacturing sector remained fragile, with further declines reported, though perhaps at a slower pace. This publication is a summary of monthly reports compiled by the Bank of England’s Agents,(1) following discussions with around 1,700 businesses in the period between mid-October and mid-January.  It provides information on the state of business conditions, from firms across all sectors of the economy.  The report does not represent the Bank’s own views, nor does it represent the views of any particular firm or region.  The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee uses the intelligence provided by the Agents, in conjunction with information from other sources, to assist its understanding and assessment of current economic conditions. FEBRUARY 2000  Inflation Report:  February 2000 62 OUTPUT Agriculture Activity in the agricultural sector remained weak during the period, with no evidence of an improvement in confidence.  Pig and poultry farming were reported as the areas of most serious weakness, reflecting increased import penetration.  Dairy farming was also reported as particularly subdued.  Knock-on effects to ancillary sectors had increased (for example, animal feed and fertiliser producers).  Structural adjustment within the sector had become more evident—there were further reports of consolidation and restructuring of farms. Moreover, banks in many regions reported increased  cash-flow problems for farmers. Manufacturing The recovery in manufacturing output continued during the period—reportedly driven by stronger demand in both domestic and external markets.  But most Agents stressed that strong growth in some sectors masked subdued growth or contraction in others.  The high-tech and communications sectors experienced the strongest growth, as well as chemicals (particularly pharmaceuticals). Contacts continued to note that the textile and clothing industry remained in decline, as did the automotive components sector.   Most manufacturing contacts continued to report that increased volumes were often associated with reduced margins, reflecting the relatively high level of sterling and increased competitive pressures (see Output prices). Despite the improvement in activity, capacity constraints were not an issue and much spare capacity remains in many sectors.  The underlying trend for many sectors (particularly at the lower value-added end) remains fragile.  There were further reports of firms, particularly those with overseas parent companies, moving production to outside the United Kingdom.   Despite anticipated millennium-related consumer demand, there was widespread consensus that manufacturing output was not greatly affected by this. Moreover, there was little evidence of increased stockbuilding, with most contacts suggesting that stocks of finished goods were at low levels and would continue to be gradually reduced.   Construction and housing While the rate of construction growth varied considerably between locations, most Agents noted that growth had remained broadly stable in recent months.  Activity remained strongest in the south and south-east of England. Growth was supported by both residential and commercial activity, with increased public spending  on education and health boosting non-residential construction in some regions.  However, some  Agents noted a reduction in housing demand for letting purposes.  Given continued weakness in some areas  of the manufacturing sector, industrial construction growth remained relatively more subdued in most  regions.   Services Service sector growth was sustained at a strong rate during the period.  Business services growth was reported to be stronger than consumer services growth.  The strongest growth had been recorded in professional services—particularly legal, accountancy and  property-related services.  The only exception to continued strong growth was the IT sector, where a pause in activity occurred in late 1999—related to Y2K caution. As expected, IT output slowed significantly prior to the new year, but activity was expected to pick up again strongly in coming months—particularly in development projects such as the Internet and e-commerce.  Growth of financial services more generally remained strong, boosted by continued mergers and acquisitions activity, as well as company restructurings. Increased capacity constraints had been reported by many Agents—mostly reflecting difficulties in recruiting suitably skilled staff (see Employment).   DEMAND Consumption Retail sales growth continued to pick up during the period.  There was widespread confirmation of stronger annual sales growth over the Christmas period.  Even department stores, many of which had been recording negative growth, reported positive growth compared  with a year earlier.  But contacts in many regions were cautious about expectations of the future pace of growth, with most expecting an easing in coming months.  In addition, most Agents continued to emphasise that sales volume growth still exceeded growth in the overall value of sales. There was evidence of strong housing activity feeding through to household good sales in some regions.  But most Agents continued to report the strongest sales growth in PCs, mobile phones and electrical goods. Clothing sales remained one of the weakest sectors,  Agents’ summary of business conditions 63 although branded items in specialist stores remained relatively strong.   There was some evidence of retailers increasing stocks prior to the new millennium, but this had been limited to a few areas—notably food, alcohol and pharmaceuticals.   Sales of new cars to individuals slowed considerably during the period, with consumers reported to have been awaiting the resolution of the review of car price differentials between the United Kingdom and continental Europe.  Annual growth in used car sales also declined further.   Exports The recovery in export demand noted in previous Agents’ Summaries continued during the period.  There was little evidence to suggest any slowing in demand from the United States.  Most Agencies continued to report an improvement in East Asia.  Contacts’ reports of European demand were varied but, overall, were more positive. Several contacts also reported improvement from the Middle East. But reports of import penetration, particularly from Europe, intensified during the period.  Contacts in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors continued to stress the negative impact of the relatively high level of sterling on domestic and overseas orders.  In addition, there had been further reports of UK manufacturers switching to cheaper overseas material and component suppliers, also boosting the demand for imports.   Investment Investment trends in the manufacturing and service sectors diverged further during the period.  Investment intentions in the manufacturing sector remained particularly weak.  Investment in the sector continued to be focused on productivity improvements, with more firms investing in capacity overseas.  There had been increased reports from firms about the difficulty of generating the rate of return required to justify investment in the United Kingdom given the attraction of lower-cost countries.  There was also concern that continued downward pressure on margins would further reduce the ability of companies to invest.   In contrast, service sector investment continued to strengthen compared with the previous period, with most plans focused on IT development.  Leisure investment remained strong, as did retail investment, especially for increased floor space in discount stores.  Capacity constraints in many professional services businesses led to increased demand for commercial office space.  In addition, increased skill shortages had prompted several firms to increase investment in staff training.  Although IT investment in both sectors was reported to have slowed significantly in the last few months of 1999, it was expected to resume again strongly in the new year—particularly for development projects relating to the Internet and e-commerce. COSTS AND PRICES Input prices Following reports of broadly flat materials prices in the previous Agents’ Summary, there had been widespread reports of increased prices in recent months and further increases were expected.  However, these reports had been confined to a few specific commodities (for example, oil and related products, some metals, plastics, paper and pulp).   Most contacts reported that the increased prices had not been a major concern as several factors had helped to constrain the effects.  Contacts had been successful at keeping prices down because of more effective purchasing techniques, such as centralised purchasing.  In addition, sterling’s relatively high level enabled companies to source components and raw materials from relatively cheaper overseas suppliers.  Pay Pay pressures in manufacturing varied between sectors but, overall, pay settlements were equal to or lower than a year earlier (around 2%–3%).  But examples of deferrals remained.  Agents noted that in almost all cases, some ‘adjustments’ had been made to the base settlement— making the assessment of underlying trends difficult. Some contacts reported that pay settlements were becoming less industry-related and more firm-related— such that profit-based bonus payments and other non-pay rewards such as share options were an increasingly important component of overall remuneration.   The picture of the services sector was reported to have been even more complex, with a wider range of pay increases reported.  Overall, settlements had been stronger than in the manufacturing sector, but were around the same as a year earlier—although there are many exceptions of much higher payments.  For example, areas of skill shortage such as professional services had recorded rates well above those of a year earlier—higher by 10% or more.  Due to more evident skill shortages (see Employment), the southern regions of England reported stronger service sector pay rises—particularly for new employees.   Inflation Report:  February 2000 64 Output prices The picture of output prices remained similar to that in previous Agents’ Summaries—widespread downward pressure on manufacturing output prices, with most contacts still reporting flat or falling prices.  Despite a clear hardening in input prices, there continued to be only limited evidence of price increases being passed up the supply chain, resulting in further pressure on manufacturers’ margins.  More recently, there had been isolated examples of price increases, but most firms suggested that they had been unable to pass on the full extent of cost increases.   Persistent domestic and overseas price competition meant that only those producing niche or specialist products were able to increase their prices.  Pressure from large supermarket chains had been cited as a factor by many manufacturing and agricultural contacts.  The significant buying power of the supermarkets forced many producers to lower their selling prices.  Contacts’ margins were eroded further by increased overheads, brought about by tighter regulatory requirements—for example, health and safety legislation and environmental standards. Downward price pressure was also reported in the services sector, but there was greater variability in the ability of firms to increase prices.  Overall, price pressures remained stronger than in manufacturing. Professional service fees were cited as increasing more recently, but many Agents reported downward pressure on travel costs (eg low-cost airlines). Retail prices The trend of flat or falling retail goods prices, reported  in previous Agents’ Summaries, continued during the period.  Consumers were reported to have remained very price-sensitive.  In addition, department stores and traditional high-street stores faced increasing competition from discount stores and Internet purchasing.  The majority of contacts do not foresee any changes to this trend in coming months.  Food and clothing continued to be noted as the areas of greatest competitive pressure.  In addition, significant price declines occurred in telecommunications and PC prices.  Where goods prices had not fallen, Agents suggest that quality improvements had occurred.   Service price inflation remained relatively high, although some contacts noted a moderation in growth of some consumer services prices (for example, package holidays, mobile phone charges).  In contrast, many professional service fees (for example, legal fees, recruitment consultancies) rose further.  In addition, contacts also noted increases in the price of insurance premiums and car servicing. The rate of annual decline in new car prices quickened during the period, ahead of the outcome of the review of car prices in the United Kingdom.  Contacts in most regions also noted further falls in the price of used cars.   Overall, house price growth in most regions appears to have been similar to or slightly slower than in recent periods.  But much disparity exists between locations.  On balance, house price growth remained stronger in the south and around city-centres.   EMPLOYMENT The labour market picture had tightened further compared with the previous Agents’ Summary, particularly in the southern regions of the United Kingdom, where skill shortages were reported as a major concern.  Skill shortages continued to be reported in IT, engineering, managerial and professional positions.  In addition, the availability of staff had become an increasing problem in construction, retailing and call-centres.  And some contacts cited difficulties in obtaining unskilled staff. Difficulties were also reported in obtaining staff from other areas because of the relatively higher cost of housing in the southern regions.   Skill shortages remained less of a concern outside the southern regions, although shortages became more evident during the period—almost entirely in the service sector.   Service sector employment continued to grow moderately, at broadly similar rates to the previous period.  Growth was reported as being fairly widespread across the sector, although the financial sector was reported as an area of weakness—reflecting bank branch closures and consolidation.  However, increased employment in  call-centre positions had offset this to some extent. There had been widespread confirmation of the continued fragility of manufacturing employment, despite the recovery in activity.  Employment levels continued to decline in almost all regions, although the pace of decline may have moderated.  In addition, examples of further expected job losses from restructuring had been cited.   65 Annex: Minutes and Press Notices of the monthly Monetary Policy Committee  meetings   Monetary Policy Committee 67 1 Before completing their November inflation and output growth projections and turning to their immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed demand and output;  the labour market; prices and costs;  money, credit and asset prices;  and the world economic outlook.  Prior to the meeting, the Committee was briefed by Treasury officials on the Chancellor’s latest projections for economic activity and the public finances.  Demand and output 2 Output was estimated to have increased by 0.9% between Q2 and Q3, significantly higher than projected in the Committee’s August Inflation Report;  and growth in the first half of the year had been revised upwards, so that the level of activity was also higher than expected.  The quarterly rate of manufacturing output growth had been 1% in Q3.  The recovery seemed to be spreading both regionally and, with some exceptions such as agriculture, sectorally.  The twelve-month growth rate of final domestic demand in Q2, the latest period for which data were available, had been 4.5%, well above trend.  Strong domestic demand had to some extent been offset in the first part of the year by destocking and, over a longer period, by weak net trade, reflecting the rise in sterling’s exchange rate and shocks to world economic growth. Aggregate demand had therefore grown more slowly than final domestic demand, and this had contained pressures on the economy’s supply capacity.  More recently, however, net trade had been stronger than expected, and in Q2 had even made a positive contribution to GDP growth.  Against this background, the Committee discussed whether the growth in demand was sustainable, and if not whether it would slow spontaneously, ie without a further policy tightening. 3 Within final domestic demand, consumption growth had been especially buoyant.  A number of possible special factors were identified.  First, strong growth in real earnings, and so real personal disposable income, might have reflected not just tight labour market conditions, but also inflation outturns that had been lower than expected when pay bargains were struck.  Other things being equal, any such effect was unlikely to continue as inflation expectations had come down over the past few years, and were now broadly in line with the 21/2% target.  However, the Committee had built into its latest central projection for inflation a number of particular downward influences on prices—such as utility price cuts and the effects of increased competition on retailers’ margins— which would tend to reduce RPIX inflation, and it was unclear to what extent these were incorporated into wage bargainers’ inflation expectations. 4 Second, the rapid growth in consumption in Q1 and Q2 partly reflected recovery from the slowdown last autumn, when confidence had been hit by the shocks to the world economy and international financial markets.  Third, consumer spending growth earlier in the year had partly been accounted for by an  earlier-than-usual spike in car sales, reflecting changes in the timing of new registrations.  That was expected to unwind in the second half of the year.  Retail sales growth appeared, however, to have strengthened during the year according to data for Q3 and some surveys, so that overall consumption growth might not slow much. Moreover, strong output growth in Q3, evidence of strong tax receipts (including corporate taxes), and the relative strength of household money and credit growth and of the housing market suggested that strong final domestic demand growth might have continued beyond the first half of the year. 5 There were, though, some possible indications that consumption growth had steadied.  Indicators of retail sales in Q4 appeared firm, but probably not more so than during Q3.  Both the CBI Distributive Trades Survey and the CIPS Services Index pointed to a moderation of activity.  Consumer confidence measures were positive but had been steady for about eight months, and in particular had not been driven upwards along with the rapid rise in house prices.  And some indicators of housing market activity, such as particulars delivered, had ticked down slightly over the past two months.  The Committee judged, however, that the recent strength in house prices would tend to support continuing buoyant consumption growth.  House prices were generally expected to continue rising over the next year or so at an annual rate which was higher than mortgage interest rates.  In the view of some members, the resulting negative own-real rate of interest should, other things being equal, make house purchase attractive. This could alternatively be thought of as expected real capital gains more than offsetting the real cost of borrowing (measured by mortgage interest rates less expected consumer price inflation). 6 Other parts of the economy were, however, facing quite different own-real interest rates.  In particular, the nominal cost of borrowing for companies was still considerably higher than manufacturing output price inflation, which might hold back investment spending. 7 More generally, since August the sterling yield curve had steepened, with rates in the two-to-five year range up by at least  50 basis points and the gap between fixed and variable mortgage rates having closed.  This had increased the cost of borrowing for both companies and fixed rate mortgage borrowers.  This would help to restrain demand in the medium term, and on one view was not fully reflected in the forecast.  Others felt that the effects were likely to be small.  (The Committee’s discussion of whether the shift in market interest rate expectations had more general implications for policy setting is summarised below under ‘Tactical considerations’.) 8 The Committee agreed that final domestic demand could not continue to grow at the current rate without jeopardizing achievement of the inflation target in the medium term.  Even without further monetary tightening some of the factors mentioned above were likely to restrain domestic demand growth.  The Committee’s latest projection incorporated a slowdown to around 3% by the end of the two-year forecast horizon, but that would probably still place pressures on supply capacity unless the contribution to GDP growth from stockbuilding and net trade was negative. 9 Stocks had been reduced in the first part of the year, consistent with reports of excess inventory holdings at the end of 1998.  More recent reports suggested that there was little reason to expect a continuing negative contribution to GDP growth from this source in the short run. 10 The principal influences on net trade pointed in different directions.  On the one hand, sterling continued to be strong, and was higher than in August.  On the other hand, the world economy was recovering more quickly than expected.  Exports of goods (excluding oil and erratics) to countries outside the EU had grown at an annual rate of 11% between Q2 and Q3;  and total goods exports grew by 6% in the three months to August compared with the previous three months.  Surveys suggested that manufacturers’ expectations of export volume growth were higher than for around three years. 11 While it was possible that the strength of the recent exports data partly reflected temporary factors, it was also possible that Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 3–4 November 1999  Inflation Report:  February 2000 68 exporters had to some extent adjusted to a level of sterling that they now expected to persist.  If so, the equilibrium real exchange rate might have risen, but it was too early to be at all confident about that possibility. 12 To the extent that export strength were to persist, a negative contribution to GDP growth from net trade would have to come from a relatively faster increase in imports, so that the UK would in effect be relying on spare capacity abroad to contain incipient inflationary pressures from strong domestic demand growth.  But while there was probably still spare capacity abroad, some members felt that it would be eroded as the world economy recovered, tending to put upward pressure on import prices. 13 On balance, the Committee had assumed that net trade would make a negative contribution to GDP throughout the forecast period, reflecting the further rise in the sterling exchange rate and a likely increase in imports. The labour market 14 There was some evidence that the labour market had tightened further.  Over the quarter, claimant count unemployment had fallen to 4.2%, and the Labour Force Survey (LFS) measure to 5.9%.  Employment had continued to rise, as had total hours worked.  Some forward-looking indicators suggested continued tightening.  Employment intentions, as measured by surveys, were up in all sectors and were above average historical levels.  Skill shortages persisted according to the Bank’s regional Agents and surveys, but with differences across regions and different types of skill.  The picture from surveys was mixed.  The BCC measure of recruitment difficulties had fallen slightly in both manufacturing and services.  The CBI survey showed skill shortages rising slightly but with the level still below its historical average. 15 Real earnings growth calculated on the basis of the Average Earnings Index (AEI) had been rising for some time, with the recent rate faster than would have been expected on the basis of  the changes in unemployment and employment.  As noted  above, one possible explanation for this was that a greater-than-generally-expected decline in inflation had boosted  ex post real earnings.  Another possible explanation was that the ‘natural’ rate of unemployment, the rate consistent with stable inflation, was higher than the Committee had assumed in its August projections.  Some members thought it unlikely that the ‘natural’ rate was below the current actual rate or that it was continuing to fall at the same rate as actual unemployment, so that there was good reason to think that labour market pressures had been increasing.  Other members noted that the Reward Index showed earnings growth still trending lower and the New Earnings Survey also gave a more benign picture of earnings growth than the AEI. Although there were different interpretations of the latest data, the Committee agreed to take as its central projection a higher assumption for real earnings growth than in August. 16 The recent nominal pay data presented a second puzzle.  On the one hand, settlements had remained around 3.5%.  On the other hand, the AEI had risen at an annual rate of 4.9% in the three months to August.  Allowing for month-to-month volatility, the AEI series had been edging upwards in recent months.  If the difference was a good guide to wage drift, it was possible that the recent rise in nominal earnings would be consolidated in forthcoming settlements.  A survey by Industrial Relations Services pointed in the opposite direction, however.  In its latest survey, 43% of respondents had expected to make lower settlements than last year, 46% the same, and 11% higher.  Last year, only 23% had expected lower settlements than the previous year, and 26% had expected higher.  It was suggested that the apparent fall in expected settlements this year might reflect the low recent RPI outturns (1.1% in August and September) and expectations that RPIX would remain below the 21/2% target for a while.  Anecdotal evidence on this, based partly on Committee members’ own regional visits, varied.  There were suggestions both that RPI was the starting point in negotiations, and that the benchmark was the higher of RPI or RPIX.  Some employers had suggested that the recent outturn of around 1% was not a feasible starting point;  before allowing for productivity improvements, it was easier to argue either for zero if necessary on the basis of a particular company’s circumstances,  or alternatively for 21/2% reflecting the inflation target and so medium-term inflation expectations.  The Committee noted that there would not be much hard data on settlements until the new year, although the Bank’s regional Agents would monitor, through their contacts, the emerging evidence. 17 Whatever the position, it was possible that settlements—both backward-looking data and forward-looking surveys—were now less reliable indicators of labour market conditions given the decline in collective bargaining, and the increase in personalised remuneration, over recent years.  If so, relatively more weight needed to be placed on the path of broader measures of earnings. 18 The Committee as a whole agreed that its assessment of labour market conditions was highly uncertain.  Structural changes and the new monetary regime meant that behaviour may have changed, but it was impossible to know by how much.  Looking forward, the quantity data, particularly the LFS series, would be important indicators of whether there were any further tightening, and possibly of its speed.  But what mattered was the extent of pressure on labour supply, for which there was no direct measure, and the extent to which this was translated into nominal earnings growth and settlements. Prices and costs 19 The main issue concerning prices was the prospective effect on the aggregate price level, and thus on measured inflation in the short-to-medium term, of various expected developments.  In particular, the Committee had made allowance in its Inflation Report projections for falls in price-cost margins reflecting an increase in competition;  utility prices changes;  and the Government’s intention, announced in its pre-Budget Report published on 9 November, of removing the automatic  over-indexation of duties on tobacco and fuel.  Taken together, on the agreed assumptions these reduced the central projection for RPIX inflation by around half a percentage point at the two-year horizon (and more before that).  20 Some members were content with the assumed effects for the first year but preferred a smaller effect in the second year.   This was for two reasons.  First, they were concerned that the Committee had focused on some one-off price falls, whereas there might be some one-off upward pressures as well;  for example, it was conceivable that, as real incomes and wealth rose, consumers were switching from cheaper, standard goods to higher-margin, customised or designer products.  Second, there were doubts about reflecting expected changes in relative prices in the aggregate nominal price level at longer horizons given that, by targeting inflation, the Committee influenced nominal, not real, demand growth over the medium term.  While the particular downward pressures might plausibly be unanticipated in the near-term, they would more likely be anticipated as time passed.  In that case, the effects of relative price changes might not show up as a decline in the overall rate of inflation over the medium run.   21 While agreeing that this analysis applied in the medium to long run, those members who supported the central assumption in the forecast argued that there was sufficiently clear evidence that the downward influences on prices would increase during at least the next two years.  They agreed that it was difficult to calibrate the short-run impact of longer-term structural changes such as intensified competition.  The Committee agreed that the size and persistence of the specific effects were inevitably uncertain, making it important to monitor the specific effects reflected in the published projections.  Monetary Policy Committee 69 Money, credit and asset prices 22 M4 growth had continued to fall, the twelve-month rate reaching 2.8% in Q3, the slowest growth rate since 1963 (when the series began).  But this reflected continued falls in the money holdings of non-bank financial institutions (OFCs).  OFC money and credit were generally regarded as being most relevant to analysis of monetary conditions during periods of financial market instability. 23 Excluding OFCs, annual broad money growth had been 6.1% in Q3.  Within this, household M4 growth was 6.4%.  M0 and household Divisia growth were each around 7%.  Growth in net credit to households was 8.6% in Q3, the highest rate since 1991. These data were broadly corroborative of the real-side evidence of continuing robust consumption growth. 24 The FT All-Share Index had risen by about 21/2% over the past month, and was at about the same level as in August.  House prices continued to rise rapidly, with the twelve month rate on both the Halifax and Nationwide indices above 10%.  As already noted, since the August Inflation Report the sterling yield curve had steepened out to medium maturities.   25 The sterling exchange rate index had risen by over half a percentage point since the Committee’s October meeting and was about three percentage points above the path assumed in the August fan chart projections.  The Committee agreed to incorporate in its published November projections an assumption that sterling would be half way between its current rate and a path related to market interest rate differentials, with the sensitivity of the projections to both shown in the Inflation Report.  Some members inclined towards the former, and some preferred the latter. The world economic outlook 26 The Committee noted the assumptions it had made in its latest projections.  The outlook in each of the US, the euro area and Japan was somewhat better, and prospects among the emerging market economies had generally improved.  The overall picture  was therefore slightly stronger than assumed in the Committee’s August projection, although there remained clear downside risks from the possibility of an equity price correction in the USA and persistent current account imbalances. 27 Against this background, Committee members agreed that the outlook for world prices looked less benign than at the time of the August Inflation Report.  While there was still spare capacity  in parts of the world economy, this was being utilised as a generalised recovery progressed.  Imported price inflation had been weak (or negative) over the past few years, but had recently begun to rise. The November inflation and output growth projections 28 The Committee agreed the projections to be published in the Inflation Report on 10 November. 29 On the assumption of constant official interest rates of 5.5%, the central projection in the published fan chart for activity was for slightly more rapid growth in the short term than in August, levelling off to slightly above trend.  The level of activity was higher than projected in August for almost all of the forecast period on account of the recent stronger-than-expected outturns.  The balance of risks was on the downside, mainly reflecting risks to the world economic outlook. 30 The Committee’s best collective judgment of the prospects for inflation was for RPIX to remain below the 21/2% target for nearly all of the forecast period, dropping just below 2% for a while, before increasing quite sharply to end up at around the target at the two-year horizon, when it was still rising.  This acceleration in prices reflected the accumulating pressures on supply capacity from the period of above-trend demand growth and the unwinding of the various temporary downward influences on the price level and so on measured inflation.  The trough was lower than in August.  The projection at the end of the forecast period was almost the same as in August, but with a higher sterling exchange rate and with the official interest rate at 5.5% rather than 5.0%.  For the same reasons as for the output projection, the balance of risks to inflation was on the downside. 31 As already described, there was considerable uncertainty in the Committee about the inflation outlook, and also a range of preferred assumptions for the path of the nominal exchange rate, earnings growth, and price-cost margins;  these were presented in Table 6.B on page 58 of the Inflation Report published on  10 November.  Different members preferred different combinations of these assumptions, either raising or lowering the inflation projection at the two-year horizon by 1/4 to 1/2 percentage points, so that there was a range of approaching one percentage point between the lowest and highest preferred central projections of individual Committee members. Tactical considerations 32 The Committee discussed three other issues potentially relevant to its policy decision:  the significance of the steepening in the sterling yield curve;  the relevance of ECB and FOMC policy decisions;  and the implications of the shape of the inflation projection. 33 On one view, the rise over recent months in short and medium-maturity market interest rates, as evidenced by for example short sterling futures contracts and the gilt yield curve, meant that monetary conditions were materially tighter than reflected in the fan chart projections.  In consequence, the market was doing some of the Committee’s work for it, so that other things being equal the Committee could operate with a lower official repo rate than would otherwise be the case.  Against this, it was argued that the Committee would take material risks with its credibility if it failed to tighten in line with market expectations, where it regarded those expectations as well based.  If demand were restrained by higher market rates but the Committee then failed to raise rates, the market’s view of the Committee’s reaction function would change, storing up trouble for the future.   34 The Committee agreed that it should not place great weight on expectations of what the ECB and FOMC might do at their meetings on 4 November (the same day as the MPC’s meeting) and 16 November respectively.  It was noted that a clear majority of market participants expected the MPC to raise its rate by 25 basis points, in which case a move of that size would probably not have much effect on market prices. 35 The shape of the inflation projection had changed materially over the past year.  A year ago, it had been humped;  in May and August it had had a gentle saucer shape;  now inflation was projected to fall further below the target, before rising more steeply towards the end of the forecast period.  This reflected the view that accumulating inflationary pressures would surface after a period in which measured inflation was held back by a series of specific price level changes.  In particular, after falling back in the short run earnings growth was likely to pick up further out in the forecast period.  On the one hand, the degree of uncertainty about the outlook was considerably greater at the two year horizon, so that the Committee could be less sure about the projected steep rise than it could be about the nearer-term prospect of inflation remaining below target.  On the other hand, monetary policy changes would have a greater effect on inflation at around two years than on nearer-term prospects.  The Committee agreed that, other things being equal, the shape of the projection meant that, compared with a profile in which inflation rose steadily, there was more time to  Inflation Report:  February 2000 70 tighten policy in order further to restrain demand growth if that still proved necessary. The immediate policy decision 36 The Committee agreed that the analysis of the outlook for inflation had changed over the past few months.  The news on demand and activity had been stronger than expected, whereas RPIX inflation had been weaker than expected.  The short-term relationship between output and prices had for some time been uncertain, and if anything that uncertainty had increased.  For a long time strong domestically-generated inflationary pressures had been offset by strongly benign external influences:  the price and net trade effects of the rising pound and of the shocks to world activity. Those external influences were now smaller.  Sterling had recently risen slightly, but by less than during 1997 and 1998, and the world economy was recovering, with consequent rises in some input costs, for example oil.  The key issues were now on the one hand the size and persistence of various downward influences on prices, and on the other hand the more-rapid-than-expected pick up in output growth and the extent to which domestic demand growth would slow without further monetary policy tightening.  Members’ analysis of the immediate policy choice varied according to how they viewed those factors. 37 A variety of arguments were identified in favour of an immediate increase in interest rates.  Activity had recovered faster than expected, and confidence indicators had remained strong despite the September tightening of monetary policy and sterling’s recent strength.  A further decline in the velocity of circulation was needed for narrow money, household Divisia and household M4 growth to be consistent with the inflation target.  Final domestic demand growth was projected to slow but still to be above trend at the forecast horizon, supported amongst other things by a strong housing market.  A significant negative contribution to GDP growth from net trade was effectively being relied upon to avoid aggregate demand exceeding the economy’s supply capacity.  The labour market seemed again to be tightening, and there was consequently a risk that unit labour cost growth would not in fact moderate.  AEI earnings growth had risen over recent months, and the Bank’s regional Agents had reported greater concerns about skill shortages increasing wage growth.  Although there was particular uncertainty about the relationship between output growth and inflation, members were influenced by the rise in wage pressures and the pick up in survey-based measures of pricing intentions.  Input price pressures were gathering.  The inflation projection was still rising at the forecast horizon so that, assuming no news in the meantime, the February projection for 2002 Q1 would be higher than the target. While RPIX inflation was likely to be contained for a while by the various downward pressures on prices, a further tightening of policy was needed to restrain the medium-term inflationary implications of continued strong domestic demand.  The risks from tightening and not tightening were not symmetric.  An immediate 25 basis point increase would not carry many risks to output as growth was above trend and the level of activity was already probably not much, if at all, below the trend level.  But there would be risks in not increasing interest rates now.  The news on activity had been significantly stronger than expected since the Committee tightened pre-emptively in September, so that not tightening again risked increasing inflation expectations, entailing a larger tightening later than would otherwise have been necessary.   38 As well as weighing the considerations set out in paragraph 37, those members of the Committee who favoured a higher central projection than that assumed—whether because of different preferred assumptions on the path of the exchange rate or price-cost margins, or on both—regarded the risks of overshooting the target as correspondingly greater.  The choice for them now was between 25 and 50 basis points.  While a case could be made for 50 basis points in order to counter the strength of underlying inflationary pressures, the following considerations led them to prefer a smaller rise.  As the Committee had discussed, there were signs, for example in surveys, that there might be some slowing in demand growth.  There was time to wait to gather evidence on this as inflation was projected to be below the 21/2% target for nearly all of the forecast period.  Separately, given market expectations, an increase of more than 25 basis points risked putting undue upward pressure on the exchange rate, which would tend to restrain net trade and import prices whereas policy action was needed to address domestically-generated inflationary pressures.   39 One member explored the arguments for an interest rate increase of less than 25 basis points.  The profile for inflation implied that the pressures on the economy’s supply capacity needed to be restrained in the medium term but that there was time to do this, particularly given the uncertainties about the outlook.  An increase of less than 25 basis points would assist that process and would, in particular, provide a clear signal of the Committee’s resolve in addressing those medium-term concerns, while recognising the downward pressures on inflation in the near term, when it was projected to drop materially below the 21/2% target.  It would be easier for the Committee to introduce smaller-than-25 basis point changes now having already tightened policy in September.  However, as this would be the first time rates changed by less than 25 basis points, there was a significant risk that the reasons would be misunderstood.  The better course was, therefore, to raise rates by 25 basis points.  40 Various arguments were advanced for maintaining the official interest rate at 5.25%.  Inflation was below target and was set to remain so over the next two years.  The outlook depended to a significant degree on two material factors:  the exchange rate, and the balance of aggregate demand and the economy’s supply capacity.  Recent export outturns added weight to the view that sterling would be stronger than the path assumed as the best collective judgment;  and survey measures showed capacity utilisation falling slightly, perhaps because investment during this upswing had been strong.  There were significant downward pressures on prices, reflecting not only one-off regulatory measures but also an ongoing intensification of competition throughout  the economy.  This would help to restrain earnings growth  below the path assumed as the best collective judgment.   Monetary conditions, as reflected in the yield curve, had tightened significantly in recent months, and were probably bearing  down on demand by rather more than had been assumed in the published fan charts.  Taking these considerations together, the steep rise in the central projection of inflation 18 months hence  was highly uncertain and there were clear downside risks to it. With a symmetric inflation target, a further tightening was not yet needed. 41 The Governor invited members of the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank repo rate be increased by 25 basis points to 5.50%.  Eight members of the Committee (the Governor, Mervyn King, David Clementi, Willem Buiter, Charles Goodhart, Ian Plenderleith, John Vickers and Sushil Wadhwani) voted for the proposition.  DeAnne Julius voted against, preferring to maintain interest rates at 5.25%.  42 The following members of the Committee were present: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers Sushil Wadhwani 43 Gus O’Donnell was also present as the Treasury representative.  Monetary Policy Committee 71 1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee on 29 October, in advance of its meeting on 3–4 November 1999.  At the start of the Committee meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and that information is included in this Annex. I The international environment 2 US GDP had risen by 1.2% in Q3, according to the provisional estimate.  Consumption and investment had remained strong, while inventories had made a positive contribution to GDP growth, following a negative contribution in Q2.  Net exports had continued to fall in Q3, albeit by less than in Q2.  Definitional and statistical changes to the National Accounts had raised the average annual GDP growth rate by 0.4 percentage points between 1992 and 1998.  The National Association of Purchasing Managers’ (NAPM) Index had fallen slightly in September, but had remained at a level consistent with an expansion of manufacturing output. 3 The quarterly growth in the Employment Cost Index measure of labour costs had declined slightly in Q3.  Annual producer price inflation had increased to 3.1% in September, and annual consumer price inflation to 2.6%.  4 GDP growth in the euro area had been revised up to 0.5% in Q2.  Both consumption and investment growth had been revised up. Industrial production had risen by 2.5% in the year to August, reflecting improving business confidence, particularly in France. M3 had risen by 6.1% in the year to September.  Private sector credit growth had been higher.  Annual inflation had remained unchanged in September, at 1.2%.  Excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, inflation had continued to fall. 5 Despite a decline in September, industrial production in Japan had risen by 3.8% in Q3.  However, the September Tankan survey indicated that companies were continuing to cut fixed investment.  Volumes of imports and exports had continued to strengthen, particularly to other Asian countries.  Consumption indicators had been mixed and retail sales growth had remained negative.  Base money had risen by 6.1% in the year to September, but broad measures of money growth had been lower.  Survey evidence had suggested that banks were becoming more willing to lend, but the stock of outstanding loans (adjusting for write-offs and securitisations) had continued to fall.  The rate of unemployment had fallen to 4.6% in September, although this had partly reflected a fall in the participation rate.  The consumer price index had fallen by 0.2% in the year to September. 6 Trade volumes had risen in the United States, Japan and the euro area.  Non-oil commodity prices had remained stable.  Oil prices had fallen very slightly, despite the most recently available evidence suggesting a higher degree of compliance among OPEC members with the agreement to limit supply.  However, the continued strength in oil prices had contributed to an increase in petrol and producer prices in all countries.   7 There had been little movement in the main dollar, yen and euro exchange rates.  Equity markets in the main economies had recovered slightly from falls earlier in the month.  There had been a further increase in euro-area interest rates implied by Euribor futures contracts, with markets expecting around 50 basis points of tightening by next summer. 8 The trend in industrial production growth in most emerging market economies had been positive.  It had remained negative in Latin America.    II Monetary and financial conditions 9 Provisional figures had suggested that narrow money growth had rebounded in October.  The one-month growth rate of notes and coin had risen to 0.8%, compared with an upwardly revised 0.1% in September.  The twelve-month growth rate (after adjusting for the introduction of the new 50 pence and £2 coins) had risen to 7.6% in October from 7.0% in September.  10 M4 had fallen by £2.9 billion (0.4%) in September,  with the annual growth rate falling back to 2.8%, the lowest  since the series began in 1963.  M4 lending (excluding the  effects of securitisations) had risen by £4.2 billion (0.4%) in September. 11 Households’ M4 deposits had risen by 1.3% in Q3.  In real terms, households’ M4 deposits were estimated to have increased by 4.8% in the twelve months to Q3.  And households’ real Divisia growth was estimated to have picked up to 5.3%, consistent with strong consumption growth.  Households’ M4 lending had grown strongly in Q3.  Annual growth had been 8.6%, the highest since 1991.  Within total lending to individuals, the annual growth rate of secured lending had been 7.5%, reflecting strength in the housing market.  Loan approvals had also been strong.  Total unsecured lending had increased by 3.3% in Q3, in line with its increases over the year.  Credit card lending had continued to grow in excess of 20% per annum. 12 Private non-financial corporations’ (PNFCs) deposits had remained broadly flat in Q3, though deposits had risen by  £1.4 billion (1.2%) in September.  The twelve-month growth rate had fallen from 7.4% in Q2 to 4.9% in Q3.  PNFCs’ M4 lending had picked up in Q3.  Lending had been particularly strong in September, increasing by £1.8 billion (0.9%).  But the annual growth rate had fallen from 4.7% in Q2 to 4.2% in Q3, compared with an average annual rate of 5.8% in 1998.  A broader measure of PNFCs’ borrowing (that also included all bond and equity issues as well as non-sterling lending by banks) had been weaker in Q3 than in Q2:  the average monthly flow had increased by £3.3 billion compared with £5.9 billion in Q2. 13 Other financial corporations’ (OFCs’) M4 deposits had fallen sharply in Q3, and the annual growth rate had continued the downward trend since 1998 Q1.  The average monthly flow had been -£2.7 billion in Q3, compared with -£1.3 billion in Q2.   The monthly flow in September had been particularly weak  (-£7.0 billion).  OFCs’ M4 lending had increased slightly in Q3, but the flow in September had been -£2.1 billion. 14 Short-term interest rate expectations implied by short sterling futures contracts had fallen since the previous MPC meeting.   The falls had been between 20 and 30 basis points in the September 2002–March 2003 contracts (less at shorter maturities). Nominal forward rates at broadly comparable maturities had also decreased (by 40–50 basis points after 3 to 3.5 years). 15 Short sterling futures and nominal forward rates derived from the gilts market had pointed to different profiles for the expected level of interest rates.  In particular, short sterling futures had pointed to a peak of 7.3% in interbank rates in December 2001, around 100 basis points greater than the peak of 6.3% for gilt yields in the forward curve in the second half of 2001.  The three-month Libor/general collateral interest rate spread had picked up sharply at the beginning of October as the date for year-end Libor delivery had passed.  But spreads further out along the curve had not looked unusual given recent experience. Annex:  Summary of data presented by Bank staff  Inflation Report:  February 2000 72 16 There had also been falls in nominal yields at the long end of the forward curve during October.  This had been mirrored in falls in long corporate bond yields.  Since the beginning of the year, the yield on 25 year corporate bonds had also fallen relative to yields on shorter maturity bonds, reflecting movements in similar maturity gilt yields.  And it was noticeable that there had been a sharp pick up in issuance of very long corporate bonds (with a maturity in excess of 15 years) over this period.  So any technical factors  that may have helped to explain the fall in relative gilt yields at the long end appeared to have reduced the funding costs for some firms. 17 The pass-through of September’s base rate rise to retail savings rates had remained incomplete in October.  Interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages had increased, following continued increases in swap rates at all maturities.  But the narrowing in the spread of five-year fixed mortgage rates over five-year swap rates observed this year had continued in October.   18 Implied inflation expectations had fallen by around 15–30 basis points out to fifteen years.  The fall had been smaller at longer maturities.  The October biannual Consensus Economics survey had pointed to a fall in inflation expectations over the medium to long term (four years and further out) between April and October. By contrast, over the same period, inflation expectations implied using index-linked gilts had risen out to eight years, though they had fallen further out. 19 The sterling effective exchange rate index (ERI) had appreciated, by 0.7% over the month.  Within this, sterling had appreciated by 1.4% against the euro, but had depreciated by 0.7% against the US dollar and by 3.0% against the yen.  Real exchange rate expectations calculated using the biannual Consensus Economics survey of long-run inflation and nominal exchange rate expectations had suggested that the markets increasingly expected the strength of sterling to be sustained.  The real exchange rate expected at end-2003 had increased by 2.8% between the October 1998 and 1999 surveys.  The FT All-Share index had risen by  2.4% on the month.  As in recent months the index for smaller capitalisation stocks had performed more poorly, falling by 0.8% on the month. III Demand and output 20 The preliminary ONS estimate of GDP growth in 1999 Q3 had been 0.9%, the strongest for two years.  The annual growth rate had risen to 1.8%.  Service sector output had grown by 1.0% in Q3 and had been 2.6% up on a year earlier—close to its long run average.  Within services, the distribution, hotels and catering sector had grown by 0.9%.  Manufacturing output had risen by 1.0% in Q3, following revisions to data in July and August. 21 Construction new orders had fallen by 5.0% in the three months to September but the CIPS index of construction activity had indicated strong growth since January 1999.  22 Retail sales volumes had risen by 0.1% in September. Growth in Q3 had been 1.2%.  The GfK consumer confidence index had been flat in October, but remained above its historical average.  The new quarterly Consumers’ Association Consumer Trends Survey consumer confidence index had been +34 in October, compared with +33 in July.  According to this survey, households expected house prices to rise by 4% over the next  year. 23 Both the Halifax and Nationwide house price indices had shown rises in annual house price inflation in October, to 10.8% and 11.6% respectively.  The Halifax index had grown particularly sharply in October, rising by 2.8%, following zero growth in September.  Particulars delivered had fallen to 122,000 in September—the second consecutive monthly fall—but remained 7% higher than a year earlier.  The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) survey had shown a similar picture of housing transactions.  Housing starts had risen by 2.9% in Q3. 24 Vehicle sales had been very volatile, given the change to the registration letter system.  Private car registrations in Q3 had fallen by 16.6% on a year earlier.  In the first 9 months of 1999, they had been 0.8% lower than the same period a year earlier. 25 The change in inventories had contributed negatively to GDP growth in Q2.  The CIPS survey of manufacturing had shown that stocks of finished goods had risen in October for the first time since July 1998.  The CBI Quarterly Industrial Trends Survey had shown that the balance of finished goods inventories had risen to -10 in October from -20 in July.  26 The BCC and CBI surveys had shown a pick-up of manufacturing investment intentions in Q3 compared to very low levels a year ago, though the CBI measure had fallen slightly to -11 in Q3 from -8 in Q2.  The BCC survey had shown an increase in investment intentions (plant and machinery), to 11 in Q3 from  3 in Q2.  But as investment intentions are forward-looking it seemed likely that actual investment would not strengthen until 2000. 27 The public sector net cash requirement had been £2.0 billion in September—with cumulative cash borrowing for 1999/2000 similar to the previous year.  28 The deficit on trade in goods had narrowed to £1.9 billion in August from £2.2 billion in July.  The EU deficit had widened slightly to £0.4 billion, but the non-EU goods deficit had narrowed to £1.5 billion.  The non-EU deficit had narrowed further to  £1.2 billion in September.  Excluding oil and erratics, export volumes had risen by 5.8% in the three months to August and imports had risen by 3.8%.  Although export growth over the past half-year had been partly driven by erratic items, underlying export growth (excluding oil and erratics) had also been positive.  Based on monthly data, the 1999 Q3 net trade contribution to GDP seemed likely to be positive. 29 Looking ahead to Q4, survey evidence had suggested continuing strong growth.  The CIPS purchasing managers’ survey of manufacturing showed a slight improvement in the headline index, to 54.2 in October, with the output index above its  no-change point of 50 for the seventh consecutive month.  The  CBI Quarterly Industrial Trends Survey had shown a sharp improvement of manufacturing sector confidence in Q3.  The BCC survey for Q3 had shown a marked improvement in domestic and overseas orders, in both the manufacturing and services sectors. Domestic and overseas orders balances had appeared to be moving in line over recent quarters—though growth in domestic orders remained stronger.  The CIPS Services Survey had shown an increase in activity in October (though the rate of growth had been the slowest since March).  The CBI Distributive Trades Survey had shown a rise in retail sales in October (though with growth slowing, and sales considered to be slightly below average for the time of year).  The improved outlook had also been broadly consistent with other surveys such as those by the Institute of Directors and the Engineers’ Employers Federation.  The latest surveys when taken together suggested quarterly growth in GDP continuing in Q4 at broadly the same rate as in Q3. IV The labour market 30 LFS employment had increased by 99,000 (0.4%) in the three months to August compared with the previous three months— up sharply on the increase in the three months to May.  In full-time equivalent terms, growth had been the strongest since the summer of 1998.  Total hours worked had risen by 0.4% during the three months to August over the previous three months.  Average hours worked had risen by 0.1%, although they had remained weaker than in the same period the previous year.  Monetary Policy Committee 73 31 According to the CIPS survey, manufacturing employment had stopped falling, employment growth in services had eased, while employment growth in the construction sector had been broadly stable.  Looking ahead, surveys of employment intentions had all indicated further employment expansion.   32 Surveys of skill shortages and recruitment difficulties had provided a more mixed picture of the degree of labour market tightness.  The CBI Industrial Trends Survey had reported that skill shortages had increased in the September quarter, but remained below their historical average.  The BCC Quarterly Economic Survey had reported that recruitment difficulties had lessened over this period, but remained high by historical standards.  The stock of unfilled vacancies in job centres had remained high in September. However, the National Press Recruitment Advertising Index had continued its downward trend.     33 Unemployment levels had fallen on both the LFS and claimant count measures.  LFS unemployment had fallen by  83,000 to 5.9% in June-August compared with the previous three months.  The claimant count had fallen by 5,400 in September, with the rate unchanged at 4.2%, the lowest since the early 1980s.  But the participation rate had still not exceeded its peak in the early 1990s.  34 Inactivity had risen by 23,000 in June-August compared with the previous three months, with the inactivity rate unchanged at 21.2%.  However, it remained about 30,000 below its level at the same time the previous year.  35 August’s average earnings data had included returns from a new sample, implementing a recommendation of the Turnbull-King report following the suspension of the index in late 1998.  Headline average earnings growth in August had risen by 0.3 percentage points to 4.9%.  Stronger growth in private sector earnings had more than offset a fall in public sector earnings growth.  Earnings growth had in recent months been affected by changes in the  timing of bonus payments, though the latest month’s figure had appeared to be free from such distortions.  The implementation  of the National Minimum Wage (NMW) may also have had an impact on recent AEI outturns.  The New Earnings Survey had shown that gross weekly pay had grown by 3.6% in the year to April 1999, slightly lower than the AEI over the same period (4.0%). 36 Other evidence on earnings growth had been mixed.  The Reward Index had risen by 0.1 percentage points in September to 3.4%, but it remained well below the AEI.  The FRES survey in October had shown stronger earnings growth for temporary staff, but little change in salary growth for permanent staff.  The Bank’s regional Agents reported that overall pay pressures had remained subdued.  There had been little new information on settlements in September, because relatively few settlements were made at this time of year.  The Bank’s AEI-weighted twelve-month mean settlement had remained at 3.5% in September.  After allowing for inflation, settlements appeared to have stopped growing, but remained at a high level.   37 Wage drift, on the basis of these data, had increased in recent months, particularly in the service sector.  Service sector wage drift was now around 1 percentage point above its average level since 1994.  Drift in the production sector had, however, been more subdued.     38 The Bank’s regional Agents had conducted a survey of their contacts to help assess the nature of the skill shortages that firms were facing.  A sample of firms thought likely to be experiencing skill shortages had been selected.  Of the 123 firms included in the survey, 84% had reported that shortages had worsened since last year, primarily in specialist areas.  A similar proportion of firms expected skill shortages to persist both in specialist areas and more generally.  Comments had included reference to poor general educational standards, as well as the legacy of the past run-down in vocational training, the erosion of work culture in some areas, and constraints on the mobility of labour.   39 Around 80% of firms sampled had expected to have to pay higher wages to obtain the skills they required, including more than two-thirds of the group for whom skills recruitment had become no worse in the past year.  More than a quarter had said there would be an increased focus on training by management.  Just under 10% had mentioned an impact on output, either via a constraint on output levels, or on the development of their business (both from their own skill shortages and shortages of IT services), or via poorer levels of service to customers.  A number had also mentioned increased pressure on existing staff, leading to higher staff turnover.             V Prices 40 The Bank’s oil-inclusive commodity price index had risen by 2.1% in September and by 13.5% on a year earlier, mainly as a result of continued strengthening in crude oil prices.  Excluding oil, commodity prices had been flat over the month and had been 3% higher compared with the previous year.  The contrast between different types of commodities had continued:  metal prices had risen further, whereas domestic food prices had fallen again.  41 Seasonally adjusted manufacturing input prices had risen by 0.7% in September to give 5.8% annual inflation.  This had largely reflected higher oil prices.  The latest CIPS survey input price index had risen to 56.2 in September, the highest for four years.  The CBI Quarterly Industrial Trends output price expectations balance had strengthened further in Q3.  Although cost pressures from materials had been mounting since early this year, output price inflation had remained subdued. 42 The latest CIPS services survey had shown a sharp rise in input prices in October, with the index rising to 59.2, its highest since May 1997.  The survey had also indicated that average prices charged had risen for the first time in four months.  43 Export and import prices had risen by 1% and 0.6 % respectively in the three months to August.  Stripping out the oil component, export prices had fallen and import prices had remained unchanged. 44 Comparing price inflation with weighted costs had suggested that retailers’ and manufacturers’ margins had fallen over the past year.  The Euler Trade Indemnity Survey had indicated that competitive pressures had somewhat reduced respondents’ profitability since early 1999. 45 RPIX inflation had remained at 2.1% in September. Whereas harvest-related seasonal food prices had risen on the month, non-seasonal food prices had fallen.  The annual rate of change of the retail sales deflator had remained at -0.5% in September.  This had mainly reflected falls in food and non-food store prices earlier in the year.   VI Reports by the Bank’s Agents 46 The Bank’s regional Agents had reported a continued recovery in economic activity.  Growth had continued to be driven mainly by domestic demand, although many firms had also reported a pick-up in export orders.  However, although manufacturing output continued to rise, the recovery had been far from universal.  Construction activity had remained strong.  The service sector continued to record strong growth, although it had not increased further.  IT activity had remained strong, as Y2K work had been replaced by firms investing in more developmental projects, such as Internet sites.  Agricultural production had remained weak in all regions.     Inflation Report:  February 2000 74 47 Retail spending had improved further, although growth had been moderate.  The pattern of consumer spending had remained similar to previous months, with department store sales weaker than in discount and out-of-town stores.  48 There had been evidence of further tightening in the labour market.  Most regions had reported increased skill shortages, with particular concern reported in the south and south-east of England. Many contacts had noted that unskilled labour had also become more difficult to recruit, especially for retail positions.  Pay pressures had remained subdued, with most settlements lower than a year ago.  However, pressures had appeared slightly stronger than in previous months, especially in southern regions.  49 Input prices had picked up further, particularly for oil-related products and some metals, although overall prices remained broadly flat.  Many manufacturers had continued to find it difficult to raise prices, and retail prices remained flat or falling. Furthermore, a number of firms thought that consumers had become more sensitive to price differences within each sector, and had begun to bargain over price to an increasing extent. 50 Growth in house prices had remained more pronounced in the southern regions, although there had been evidence that growth here had peaked.  The buy-to-let market had slowed.  In the northern regions of the United Kingdom, growth in housing activity had continued to increase steadily. VII Market intelligence 51 The effective exchange rate index for sterling had been little changed since the October MPC meeting, but sterling had appreciated against the euro from the middle of the month.  This strengthening had coincided with the announcement of merger and acquisition activity.  It was possible that anticipation of potential sterling purchases had encouraged others to bring forward their purchases of sterling.  Such influences on sterling’s exchange rate were expected to be temporary.   52 Market participants had continued to comment that movements in US equities were an influence on the dollar’s exchange rate against sterling and other currencies.  There had been some evidence of a greater correlation between the Dow Jones Industrial Average and dollar exchange rates, including that between the dollar and sterling.  However, the wider implications for sterling’s effective exchange rate had been less clear.   53 The difference between interest rates implied by futures and economists’ interest rate forecasts had widened over the three months to October.  This was more likely to be related to increased risk-aversion, the unwinding of long-standing trading positions and mortgage-related swap market activity, rather than a genuine difference of view between traders and economists.  In terms of the immediate rate decision, market commentators on balance attached a high probability to a 25 basis point increase in the Bank’s repo rate but did not expect changes in rates in December or January.   Monetary Policy Committee 75 1 Before turning to the immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed demand and output;  money and asset prices; prices and costs;  the world economy;  the labour market;  and other considerations relevant to the decision. Demand and output 2 Final domestic demand in Q3 had turned out as expected at the time of the November Inflation Report.  However, consumption had been a little stronger than expected, while investment was a little weaker.  On the basis of the pattern of revisions over recent years, it was quite possible that the Q3 investment figures could be revised up.  However, it was also possible that the weaker figures partly reflected a ‘millennium pause’ in IT-related investment spending.  The slightly stronger-than-expected consumption numbers reflected the ONS’ attempts to capture the changing seasonal pattern of car registrations.  The figures for consumption growth in the first half of the year could therefore be revised  down, reflecting the latest estimates of the seasonal factors,  when the National Accounts for Q3 were published.  Abstracting from these seasonal effects, the underlying picture for consumption growth in Q3 appeared broadly in line with expectations at  the time of the November Inflation Report.  Looking beyond  Q3, the latest evidence suggested that car registrations were  turning out quite weak—possibly reflecting expectations of reductions in car prices in the near future, in which case car  sales, and hence consumption, might subsequently pick up at some point.   3 The Committee discussed other recent indicators of household consumption.  Retail sales growth had remained strong at the beginning of the fourth quarter, though the three-month on three-month growth rate for October was slightly lower than it had been a few months ago.  The Bank’s regional Agents’ contacts were reporting some strengthening of retail activity, but the picture seemed somewhat weaker than the official data.  There were several possible explanations.  First, sales values were rising less quickly than volumes, since the retail sales deflator was falling, and this might be affecting contacts’ responses.  Second, retail floor space was probably still rising—and this was reflected in the difference between total sales and like-for-like sales in the British Retail Consortium survey.  Third, it was possible that the Agents’ retail contacts were weighted more towards those sectors that were losing market share, such as department stores, and less towards discount stores.  4 Consumer confidence, as measured by the GfK survey, had fallen in November but remained above its long-run average.  The MORI survey had risen, but this series was usually more volatile than the GfK measure.  While the recent fall in the GfK survey might reflect monthly volatility, the rises in interest rates since the beginning of September might have had some dampening effect on confidence.  The disaggregated responses to the individual questions in the survey showed that respondents thought that the general level of unemployment would rise.  This seemed at odds with the recent evidence that employment had continued to grow. It was possible that, although employment remained high, the pace of job creation and job destruction was higher now than in the past and that this had heightened individuals’ feelings about their job insecurity in an existing job.  If so, that uncertainty could in turn have a dampening effect on consumption growth.  But looking beyond the latest movements in consumer confidence and retail sales, the fundamental determinants of consumption such as housing and financial wealth and real incomes seemed to be strengthening. 5 Turning to net trade, both exports and imports had turned out a little stronger than expected at the time of the November Inflation Report.  The UK share of world export markets probably increased in Q3, but was much lower than it had been prior to the appreciation of sterling from August 1996.  The export orders index in the latest CIPS survey had remained above 50 for the seventh successive month, while the CBI monthly trends survey balance for export orders was negative, but less so than a year ago.  There were, however, some signs that export optimism had deteriorated in recent months, for example in the DHL survey.   6 There had also been slightly stronger-than-expected import growth in Q3, so that the contribution of net trade to GDP growth in Q3 was only slightly more positive than had been expected. Strong growth in imports could be linked to re-exporting, and it seemed stronger than was consistent with recently observed domestic demand growth.  7 Looking forward, the central projection for activity in the published fan chart assumed that net trade would make negative contributions to GDP growth in the forecast period.  The net trade contributions in the central projection were somewhat more negative than projected by the average of other forecasters, and that largely reflected a steeper assumed sterling depreciation by other forecasters.  The sterling effective exchange rate had strengthened since the November Report and other things being equal that would tend to depress net exports relative to the projection made then. 8 The latest data for non-EU trade in October showed a marked fall in exports but September had been strong.  That evidence seemed broadly consistent with the projections so far. The Agents’ special survey tried to shed light on the recent export puzzle.  The picture that emerged was of very considerable price and market pressures.  This was particularly marked for exports to the EU, which was to be expected given the movements in sterling against the euro compared with the dollar.  Overall, the export picture in the survey seemed weaker than that suggested by recent official data.   9 On output, the latest estimate of GDP growth in Q3 was still in line with the 0.9% first estimate available at the time of the November Report.  The latest manufacturing data showed a slight upward revision to Q3, although growth in October had been lower than the average monthly rate in Q3.  The CBI Industrial Trends survey for November recorded a positive balance for output expectations, though less positive than in October.  The latest construction survey indicators also seemed quite buoyant, more so than the official data on new orders.  The monthly CIPS services survey had shown a marked increase in the activity index.  This index looked particularly strong when compared with the average since the survey began in 1996, which itself reflected a period of strong service sector output growth.  The latest CBI/Deloitte & Touche survey however pointed to some recent weakening of consumer services volumes.  There were some suggestions that the latest rise in the CIPS survey might be millennium-related rather than a more sustained acceleration in service sector activity.  There was however little evidence from the Bank’s regional Agents of strong millennium-related effects on demand or output, apart from the possible pause in IT investment noted above and some isolated examples of increasing inventories.  The latest National Institute of Economic and Social Research projection of GDP growth in the three months to November was 0.8%, down slightly on the outturn for October.  The staff’s latest survey-based estimate of GDP growth in Q4 was broadly at the same rate as in the third quarter, but higher than in November’s central projection. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 8–9 December 1999  Inflation Report:  February 2000 76 10 Overall there was not much evidence, on balance, that demand and output were turning out differently from what had been expected in November.  If anything, the risks were of slightly stronger outturns in Q4 than thought a month ago. Money, credit and asset prices 11 Broad money growth, excluding Other Financial Corporations, remained fairly stable.  The most striking monetary indicator over the past month had been the marked increase in narrow money in November.  Notes and coin were growing at the fastest annual rate since 1980, with a particularly rapid rise in November.  The seasonal adjustment updated the seasonal factors each month using a three-year window.  This meant that one third of the rapid increase in November had already been attributed as a seasonal effect—the headline increase was even larger than the seasonally adjusted figures suggested.  The staff had tried to make allowance for the possible effects of the millennium and the Government’s Winter Allowance, but it seemed likely to explain only part of the total increase in November, though there was great uncertainty over the magnitude of these effects.  An increase in money balances ahead of the year-end might occur for several reasons.  For example, it might be precautionary on account of concerns about computer-related Y2K problems, or it might be to spend on millennium-related celebrations.  Even in the latter case, the effects might only be temporary if spending was transferred from other months.  It might have no effect on aggregate spending if it reflected a shift from other types of spending to more  cash-based items.  In any event, it seemed unclear why households should withdraw substantial balances in November, so far from the year-end.  There was no anecdotal evidence to support a large effect.  Although there was a link between retail sales and narrow money, it had not been particularly close from month to month recently.  There was, however, a risk that higher money balances would eventually feed through to consumption, even if the balances were not spent immediately.  There was a range of views on how much weight to attach to the risk of higher spending.  For some, the risk was mitigated by the fact that the large monthly increase came just before the year end, when interpretation of month-on-month changes was usually difficult and was made more so by any potential millennium-related effects. 12 Asset prices had risen in the UK and overseas.  The FTSE 100 had risen by 5% over the past month and the FTSE All-Share index was now more than 6% up, and over 9% above the fifteen day average used as the starting assumption in the November Inflation Report projections.  There had been rises in Japan, continental Europe and the United States too.  The FT  Small-Capitalisation index had outperformed the FTSE 100 index over the past month.  Some of the rise in share price indices was accounted for by high-tech IT stocks, but this did not account for the entire rise.  Nor was it clear that the rise in IT stocks should be excluded in any event, because it was necessary to look at the aggregate.  However, fluctuations in these stocks might be contributing to greater volatility.  The rise in indices both here and abroad seemed broadly consistent with a general rise in market confidence about the strength of world activity.   13 For the UK the rise in equity wealth, coupled with the strength of borrowing for consumption, suggested a robust outlook for consumption growth.  House prices had again been volatile, with the Nationwide index recording a strong rise on the month, while the Halifax index had fallen.  Annual percentage rates of increase in house prices, and hence gross housing wealth, were in double digits, and many short-run growth rates were at least as  fast as the annual rates.  Activity indicators in the housing market had been mixed over the month, but on balance showed activity broadly stable over the past few months and stronger than at  the beginning of the year.  The staff’s provisional estimate of the increase in mortgage equity withdrawal in the third quarter, though well below the levels of the late 1980s as a share of personal income, was quite marked, and appeared to be closely correlated with recent growth rates in household consumption spending.  Prices and costs 14 The Bank’s commodity price index had fallen in October, reflecting both the fall in oil prices and a fall in metals and food prices.  However oil prices had risen again in November.  Producer input prices continued to reflect higher oil prices.  At the retail level, oil prices had been reflected in higher inflation in continental Europe.  But despite higher petrol prices in the UK too— contributing around 0.5 percentage points to annual inflation in the year to October—inflation as measured by the harmonised consumer price index in the UK was now below the European average.  This was not too surprising given the past strengthening of sterling. 15 Retail price inflation on the targeted RPIX measure had risen to 2.2% in October.  This was in line with expectations at the time of the Committee’s November meeting.  The latest CBI Distributive Trades survey balance for retail prices had turned negative in November, and was well below its historical average, which might point to further weakness in retail prices.  However, the historical average reflected periods of much higher inflation, so it was difficult to interpret the recent data.  Anecdotal evidence suggested wider discounting than in the past, even of some luxury brands.  It was difficult to tell if the lower-than-expected outturns for some of the components of the retail prices index provided evidence of a larger-than-expected squeeze on retail margins than had been assumed in the fan chart published in the November Inflation Report.  It might simply reflect a different timing for the reduction in margins than had been assumed.  Alternatively, it could be due to other cost factors that had yet to be observed in the data or simply month-to-month volatility with no implications for the short-term profile of inflation. 16 The weakness of goods prices was clearly reflected in the retail sales deflator, which was based on the same data.  The CBI/Deloitte & Touche survey balance for prices of consumer services had also fallen recently, but this survey had only been running for a few quarters.  However, the CIPS services prices index had risen on the month.  17 The continuing pressure on retail margins did not seem to reflect weak demand, but other factors such as increased competition.  If so, increased competition and reduction in retail margins might spread along the supply chain.  Even given the recent rise in input prices, it might be difficult for manufacturers to pass on higher costs, at least in the short term.  It was possible that aggregate supply had become more elastic for reasons other than a structural increase in competition in the UK, such as increased investment elsewhere by international companies and a corresponding increase in world supply.  More efficient and cheaper access to information about domestic and overseas production and prices, and associated scope for cost savings on inputs, might also have an effect on UK prices.  For example, the more widespread use of the Internet might affect UK productivity growth and pricing behaviour.  There was little evidence that this was, as yet, having a big effect, though its use could grow rapidly. In the first instance one might see greater effects on inter-firm trade than at the retail level.  One much quoted example of Internet activity was in books, but recent movements in prices looked small when compared with the impact of the ending of the Net Book Agreement some time ago.  It was therefore important not automatically to assume that the effects of the Internet would be bigger than previous shocks.   18 Most of the evidence of weaker prices related to goods prices;  indeed the gap between service and goods price inflation was as large as at any time since 1992.  That gap was much larger than could be explained by differences in trend productivity growth between the sectors.  Monetary Policy Committee 77 19 Within the RPI there were large rises in a few components of the services index—notably insurance and foreign holidays.  Some members thought it was useful to gauge the underlying behaviour of RPIX by looking at sub-indices which excluded volatile items, such as fuel prices, or possibly other ‘exogenous’ items such as seasonal foods and taxes.  Other members thought that similar arguments could be applied to changes in prices resulting from exchange rate movements;  and that other than in the very  near-term, when nominal rigidities existed, it was not useful to exclude items from the index.   20 There had been some recent announcements on water, electricity and gas pricing.  Taken together the effect on the  short-term profile for retail prices was broadly in line with what had been assumed in the November Inflation Report projections. The world economy 21 The likely pace of growth in the United States remained subject to various uncertainties.  The latest stock market rise added weight to the factors underpinning strong consumption growth, but had also added to the risks of a sharper slowdown if equity prices were to fall.  Inflation had risen somewhat over recent months, although not on the core measure.  In any event, the US situation appeared to be rather different from the conjuncture of events in the UK, because of the much stronger recent productivity growth there. 22 The Japanese GDP data had been heavily revised on release of the Q3 estimate.  GDP was recorded to have fallen by 1% in the third quarter, but this followed an upward revision to the second quarter.  Overall the new data and revisions back to 1997 left the level of GDP broadly in line with what had been expected at the time of the November Inflation Report.  The markets had seemingly taken the view that as much weight should be placed on the upward revisions to the earlier data, as on the weaker Q3 growth number (which was subject to future revision).  But if one placed more weight on the momentum implied by the recent numbers, then that would imply a less sanguine view of prospects for the Japanese economy. 23 The news on activity in the rest of the industrial world, including the euro area, was either in line with or slightly more positive than expected over the past month.  There seemed little news in emerging markets over the past month that would materially affect the prospects for UK inflation.   24 Turning to the pattern of exchange rates, the recent German data had contributed to a slight rise in the euro over the days leading up to the Committee’s meeting, though over the past month as a whole the euro had weakened further against the dollar. Sterling’s effective exchange rate had not changed much since the time of the November meeting, but was around 1% above the fifteen-day average used as a starting point for the projections. That strength was primarily against the euro, rather than against other currencies, reflecting more buoyant views of prospects for activity in the US and UK.  Relative movements in yield curves over the period could account for some of sterling’s appreciation against the euro.  Markets had now had a chance to adjust to the interest rate increases in the United States, the euro area and the United Kingdom over the past few months.  There had been no immediate major effects on financial markets.  Compared with some people’s prior expectations, market activity still seemed to be quite well sustained as the end of the year approached. The labour market 25 The latest labour market data had by and large been as expected.  There was, however, some concern among some of the Bank’s regional Agents’ contacts about prospects for the coming pay round.  The Agents were also finding more widespread evidence of skill shortages, which had been building since the spring.  But neither this nor any of the other survey evidence on skill shortages had yet fed through to the observed earnings data.  It was possible that the sentiment being picked up by the Agents was rather more about a general desire for more highly trained and educated workers rather than a cyclical point about tightness in the labour market. 26 Some data presented by Bank staff on employment transition probabilities—flows out of various categories of inactivity—had highlighted a large number of people flowing from the category of ‘not wanting a job’ into employment within a short period of time. At first sight this was rather surprising, but might be explained by people seeing new job opportunities become available which they had not previously expected.  More research was needed in this area, but so far it suggested that the pool of people who could move into employment was greater than might be thought based on more traditional and more narrowly focused measures of potential labour supply.  It might help to explain why labour tightness had not fed through to earnings as fully as might have been expected. 27 No new official whole economy productivity or unit labour cost data were yet available for Q3, but manufacturing productivity had shown signs of picking up and had consequently begun to reduce the rate of increase of unit labour costs in that sector.  The latest GDP data suggested that productivity growth for the whole economy might have risen to around 2% at an annualised rate in the third quarter, which would be close to its long run average.  This was important, as the central projection in the November Report had assumed a recovery in whole economy productivity growth over the forecast period.  The fall in profit margins could not go on forever, and required a continuing intensification of competitive pressures.  Unless there was an even stronger recovery in productivity growth than had been assumed, earnings growth would need to turn out as low as assumed for the central projection of inflation to hold.  Even then, unless productivity growth improved further, inflation would tend to rise at some point in the future, as the short-run downward price effects—of lower margins and a strengthening exchange rate—wore off and the effect of the underlying strength of demand began to dominate. 28 Members of the Committee reflected on the November central projection for real earnings growth.  The earnings profile in the central projection was somewhat lower than the average of outside forecasts made for 2000, and given the evidence of skill shortages it was possible that the risks to this projection were more clearly on the upside.  But some members retained doubts about the interpretation of the data, and as yet there was no firm evidence that the outturn for earnings growth was diverging markedly from the central projection made in November.  This question would need to be re-examined in the context of the February forecast round. Tactical considerations 29 There were several tactical considerations discussed this month.  First, the Committee concluded that there was no reason to change the view outlined in the minutes of the September meeting that the Y2K period should not constrain UK monetary policy setting.  However, there was a related consideration concerning the data.  The uncertainties about the size of millennium-related effects might make it more than usually difficult to interpret the data relating to the period covering the year-end;  particular examples were for consumer spending, investment, money and earnings.  In each case there would be difficulty in reaching a clear interpretation of the data immediately after the turn of the year.  But it was always difficult to interpret the data for, say, retail sales around Christmas and the New Year.  It was not clear that this fog would be that much thicker than usual, and it would not preclude making a change in interest rates in either December or January.   The immediate policy decision 30 Some members thought that the balance of arguments was in favour of a rise in interest rates of 25 basis points this month, but  Inflation Report:  February 2000 78 attached different weights to the various supporting factors.  First, for those members who had contemplated voting for a 50 basis point increase in interest rates in November (rather than 25), there did not need to be much news on the month to justify a further 25 basis point rise in rates now.  Second, and related to this, the latest data did on balance suggest the central projection for inflation would be a little higher than thought a month ago.  The latest evidence on activity was at least as strong as expected a month ago, and suggested that the pace of output growth might not slow as envisaged in the central case.  In particular, world demand now seemed to be strengthening, and some of the influences on UK consumption growth—wealth, real incomes and borrowing— seemed to have remained strong or to have strengthened over the past month.  On prices, there had been signs of a compression of retail margins, and sterling had strengthened which would put further downward pressure on the price level.  But the oil price had risen further.  Third, the position of the UK economy looked very different from when the last reduction in interest rates had been made in June.  It was unclear whether the 50 basis point rise in rates since the summer would be sufficient to slow the economy to a more sustainable pace, and a rise in rates now might helpfully affect expectations.  Fourth, the projection for inflation made in November had an upward slope at the two-year horizon.  The passage of each month meant that other things being equal the projection for inflation would be higher two years ahead.  So even if there were no news on the month there could be a case for a rise in interest rates.  Fifth, in the view of some members, the risks of making a big monetary policy mistake were greater on the upside, and stemmed from the potential for the tightening labour market to begin to feed through rapidly to wages and prices, which suggested raising rates sooner rather than later.  Overall, the case for raising rates this month, rather than delaying, was not a matter of urgency, but on balance the evidence pointed to the need for a further rise in the repo rate of 25 basis points.  31 A second view was that there was no need for a change in interest rates this month.  On this view, the news on demand and output was broadly as expected at the time of the Inflation Report, albeit with the risks perhaps now slightly more on the upside.  The news on labour market quantities was also slightly tighter than expected.  However, the likely short-term profile for inflation was if anything a little lower than thought a month ago.  Indeed, the downward effects on prices from reductions in utilities prices, removal of fuel and tobacco escalators and increasing competition could well be larger than had been built into the published central projection in November.  Overall, neither the news on demand nor that on prices this month was conclusive.  The data continued to highlight the same short-run trade-off puzzle between output and prices discussed last month in the Report and the minutes of the Committee’s previous meeting.  Looking forward, the prospects were still for rising inflation at the two-year horizon, so a further tightening would probably be needed at some stage if the economy continued along the path outlined in the published November central projection.  In particular, given the latest news on labour market quantities and skill shortages, it was possible that the central projection for earnings growth in 2000 made at the time of the November Inflation Report was now too low.  But there would be more hard evidence on earnings fairly soon as many settlements were agreed early in the New Year, and the risk of waiting another month or two would be unlikely to give rise to a big policy mistake given the saucer-shaped projection for inflation.  There was time to wait and see if signs of earnings and price pressures emerged. There was therefore no need to change interest rates this month.  32 A third view also led to a conclusion that no change in interest rates was needed this month.  On this view, the latest indicators were consistent with a slowdown in the rate of growth of domestic demand and output through the fourth quarter of 1999 and beyond, and the short-term profile for inflation was at least as weak as in the central projection in the Inflation Report.  The exchange rate had appreciated compared with the central assumption, and was closest to the constant exchange rate profile described in the November Inflation Report (see pages 48 and 58).  A higher exchange rate would put more downward pressure on prices than implied by the November central projection.  On this view it was prudent to wait and gauge the impact of the two previous increases in interest rates since the summer, and to see whether there would be a further intensification of competitive pressures.  A rise in interest rates now would risk pushing inflation further below the target.   33 The Governor invited members to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate be maintained at 5.5%.  Six members of the Committee (the Governor, David Clementi, Charles Goodhart, DeAnne Julius, Ian Plenderleith and Sushil Wadhwani) voted for the proposition.  Mervyn King, Willem Buiter and John Vickers voted against, preferring a rise in rates of 25 basis points. 34 The following members of the Committee were present: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers Sushil Wadhwani 35 Gus O’Donnell was also present as the Treasury representative.   Monetary Policy Committee 79 1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by the Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee on 3 December, in advance of its meeting on 8–9 December 1999.  At the start of the Committee meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and that information is included in this Annex. I The international environment 2 Growth in the United States in Q3 had been stronger than expected, but GDP had fallen in Japan, and there had been a  mixed picture in the euro area, with activity stronger in France  than in Germany.  The latest data from the US and Japan had suggested that growth in gross trade volumes had remained at relatively high levels, though might have fallen back slightly  in recent months.  Oil prices had risen again in November, reflecting stronger global demand prospects, high compliance  rates with the agreement among OPEC members to limit supply,  and lower oil stocks in OECD countries.  World food prices had fallen. 3 US GDP growth in Q3 had been revised upwards to 1.4%, largely reflecting higher contributions from net trade and stockbuilding.  Annual growth in industrial production had risen to 3.3% in October.  Although the index of capacity utilisation in the National Association of Purchasing Managers’ survey had been stable over the last year, the survey had been pointing to lengthening delivery times and a rising backlog of orders, consistent with a rather stronger outlook for activity.  Consumer confidence had risen in November, on the back of strong income expectations.  Unemployment had continued to fall, reaching 4.1% in October, and had remained unchanged in November.  Producer prices had fallen by 0.1% in October, reflecting falls in food and energy prices.  Annual consumer price inflation had remained unchanged in October, at 2.6%. 4 German GDP had risen by 0.7% in Q3, and growth rates in Q1 and Q2 had been revised upwards.  French industrial and consumer confidence indicators had grown by considerably more than those in Germany in October and November.  Annual growth in industrial production in the major three euro area economies had fallen slightly to 0.9% in September, reflecting growth of 3.1% in France, 0.3% in Germany and -0.7% in Italy.  But a strong rise in German manufacturing orders in October and a rise of industrial production of 1.4% in the year to October had suggested a possible future pick up in German activity.  The euro area broad money measure M3 had risen by 6.0% in the year to October.  Annual inflation in the euro area had risen slightly in October to 1.4%, mainly reflecting the rise in energy prices over the year.  Survey measures had suggested that inflation was expected to rise further in coming months. 5 Japanese GDP had fallen by 1% in Q3, a steeper fall than market expectations, although the level of GDP in the previous quarter had been revised up substantially.  Industrial production had fallen by 2.3% in the month to October, but it had still been 1.7% higher than a year ago, and overtime hours had risen in recent months.  Inventories had continued to decline, falling by 8.8% in the year to October.  The unemployment rate had remained unchanged at 4.6% in October.  Base money growth had slowed to 5.5% in the year to October, but growth in broader measures had picked up slightly, and bank lending had continued to recover from the low in August.  The consumer price index had fallen by 0.7% in the year to October, but excluding food had fallen by only 0.1%. The Economic Planning Authority had released details of a further ¥18 trillion economic revival package. II Monetary and financial conditions 6 Narrow money had grown strongly in November.  After adjustment for seasonality and the introduction of the new 50p and £2 coins, notes and coin had increased by 1.4% on the month, and the twelve-month growth rate had risen to 8.9%, the highest since 1980.  The usual practice of current updating of seasonal adjustment meant that part of the rise in the seasonally unadjusted data in November had been treated as a seasonal effect, depressing the seasonally adjusted figure relative to an alternative measure based on non-updated seasonal factors.  Part of the pick up in November had reflected special effects, such as a temporary increase in cash holdings relating to government Winter Allowance payments.  But even after adjusting for an estimate of the quantitative impact of these factors, narrow money growth had still been unusually strong, consistent with evidence from other sources of robust growth in retail sales. 7 The stock of M4 had risen by £4.2 billion (0.5%) in October. The twelve-month rate had picked up slightly to 3.0%.  M4 lending (excluding securitisations) had grown by £7.6 billion (0.8%) in October, and the twelve-month rate had risen to 7.2%.  Robust lending growth had been driven by the continuing strength in lending to households and a rise of some £3 billion in lending to other financial corporations (OFCs) on the month. 8 Households’ M4 deposits had risen by £2.2 billion (0.4%) in October.  M4 lending to households (excluding securitisations) had remained strong, rising by £4.1 billion (0.8%) in October.  The twelve-month rate had picked up to 8.8%, the highest rate since 1991 Q3, as net secured lending had continued to grow strongly. Within total lending to individuals, net secured lending had risen by £3.6 billion (0.8%) in October, and the twelve-month growth rate had increased to 7.9%.  The value of loan approvals had also been strong (at £10.4 billion).  October’s net secured lending and loan approvals data, combined with the historically high level of the stock of loan approvals, were consistent with continued housing market strength.  Total unsecured lending had also been strong, growing by £1.0 billion (0.9%) in October, but growth had weakened over the past year.  According to provisional Bank estimates, mortgage equity withdrawal had risen sharply to  £2.4 billion in Q3, leaving ‘total borrowing for consumption’ (defined as mortgage equity withdrawal plus unsecured lending) at its highest level as a percentage of disposable income since 1990. 9 The M4 deposits of private non-financial corporations (PNFCs) had risen by £1.7 billion (1.4%) in October, and the  twelve-month rate had risen sharply to 6.9%.  M4 lending to PNFCs had grown more slowly, rising by £0.4 billion (0.2%) in October. But PNFCs’ total borrowing, including foreign currency borrowing and capital market finance, had remained strong. 10 OFCs’ M4 deposits had risen by £0.3 billion (0.2%) in October, although the twelve-month rate had remained very weak at -7.2%, reflecting the sharp rundown earlier in the year.  OFCs’ M4 borrowing had been much stronger in October, rising by  £3.1 billion (1.6%) on a month earlier, and by 6.0% on a year earlier. 11 Short-term nominal forward rates at maturities up to five years had fallen following the 25 basis point rise in the repo rate and the publication of the Inflation Report in November.  But market rates had risen again following the release of the MPC minutes, most markedly at maturities of around one year.  The falls in long nominal rates seen in late October had continued in the first week of November.  This had partly reflected a global bond rally, but the fall in UK gilt yields had been greater than in other Annex:  Summary of data presented by Bank staff  Inflation Report:  February 2000 80 countries.  Corporate bond yields at comparable maturities had also fallen.  Long real interest rates derived from the index-linked gilt market had shown a similar pattern to long nominal rates. Although market expectations of inflation in the short to medium term (derived from nominal and index-linked gilts) had fallen immediately after November’s MPC meeting, the decline had largely been unwound later in the month.  Survey measures of inflation expectations for 2000 had been broadly unchanged on the month. 12 Quoted retail rates data had suggested that the November rate rise had been almost fully passed through to standard variable mortgage rates.  Fixed-rate mortgages had risen by less, reflecting movements in swap rates. 13 The FTSE All-Share index had risen by 6.2% since the November meeting.  Small capitalisation stocks had outperformed the FTSE 100 and All-Share indices, rising by 12.2%. 14 The sterling effective exchange rate index had appreciated by 0.3% since the November MPC meeting, and by 0.8% compared with the starting point for the November Inflation Report projection.  Over the month, sterling had appreciated against the euro, but had fallen against the dollar and yen.  Monetary news had appeared to explain much of the move in the euro-sterling bilateral rate. III Demand and output 15 Quarterly GDP growth at constant market prices had been unrevised, at 0.9%, in Q3.  The annual growth rate had also been unchanged at 1.8%.  Total industrial production had risen by 1.2% in Q3 and by 0.3% on a year earlier.  Manufacturing output had grown by 1.0% in Q3, the first time since 1995 Q2 that manufacturing output growth had been higher than services, though the level of manufacturing output had still been 0.2% lower than a year earlier.  Services output had grown by 0.9% in Q3, revised down from 1.0% in the first release, with annual growth at 2.4%. Construction output had grown by 0.5% in Q3. 16 The expenditure breakdown of GDP had shown domestic demand growing by 0.7% in Q3.  Changes in inventories had contributed 0.2 percentage points to growth, so final domestic demand had grown by 0.5%. 17 Private consumption had grown by 0.6% in 1999 Q3, and annual growth had been 4.4%.  This had been stronger than expected at the time of the November Inflation Report, partly because of an unexpectedly small fall in vehicle expenditure.  The seasonal pattern of vehicle expenditure in 1999 had been affected by the change in registration dates for new cars.  The ONS had included an estimate of the size of this seasonal shift in their estimate of total Q3 spending.  But a similar adjustment had not yet been made to Q1 or Q2 in light of the latest data.  Total new car registrations over the first eleven months of the year had been 1.8% lower than a year earlier.  A complete breakdown of consumption growth had not yet been published, but retail sales had grown by 1.2% in Q3.  Government consumption had risen by 0.5% in Q3, down from 0.6% in Q2. 18 Total investment had grown by 0.2% in Q3.  Business investment had fallen by 1.3%, though it had remained 4.3% higher than a year earlier.  Within this, manufacturing investment had fallen by 5.2% in Q3, and service sector investment had fallen by 0.6%.  The fall in business investment had been puzzling, but the investment data had tended to be revised upwards in recent years. The gross operating surplus of corporations had risen by 2.3% in Q2, and the annual rate of decline had moderated to -5.0%. 19 Inventories had made a positive contribution to GDP growth in Q3, reflecting a slowdown in the pace of decline.  Including the alignment adjustment, inventories had fallen by £0.7 billion in Q3, compared with a fall of £1.2 billion in Q2.  The CBI monthly survey in November had reported that manufacturers still perceived their stocks to be more than adequate. 20 Net trade had contributed 0.2 percentage points to GDP growth in Q3, the second consecutive positive quarterly contribution.  Total exports of goods and services had grown by 6.2%, and imports had grown by 4.9%.  The rise in goods exports had been more broadly based than in Q2, with exports to non-EU countries growing by 10.1% and exports to the EU rising by 7.0%. 21 The Bank’s regional Agents had conducted a survey of their contacts to help assess the nature of the export recovery.  A sample of mostly manufacturing firms with export-related business had been selected.  Of the 121 firms responding to the survey, slightly more than half had indicated that their export volumes had not grown over the past six months.  Demand had been reported to be strongest in North America, followed by Asia and other markets. Europe remained the weakest market, but had been recovering slowly.  A large number of exporters to Europe had noted that lower profit margins had been a factor affecting export volumes in the past six months. 22 On the assumption that the exchange rate remained unchanged, the expected growth in export volumes over the next six months had varied across regions.  Around 40% of respondents exporting to Europe expected volumes to fall, with an additional 30% expecting growth to slow but remain positive.  Those exporting to regions outside Europe had been more optimistic, with around three-quarters expecting positive export growth. 23 Turning to indicators of Q4 activity, manufacturing output had risen by 0.1% in October and retail sales volumes had risen by 0.5%.  Retail sales volumes had grown by 1.2% in the three months to October compared with the previous three months, and by 4% compared with a year earlier.  Growth in retail sales volumes had continued to exceed that of retail sales values.  The CBI Distributive Trades survey had shown a balance of +24 respondents reporting higher activity in November, and further growth had  been expected in December.  The MORI measure of consumer confidence had risen to +4 in November, but the GfK confidence index (which was less volatile and had a bigger sample) had fallen to -1.5. 24 Housing data had been mixed in November, with the Halifax house price index falling by 0.5%, but the Nationwide measure rising by 1.9%.  Indicators of housing activity had also been mixed, but generally pointed to continued high levels of activity. Particulars delivered had risen by 4.1% in October and had been 17.4% up on a year earlier.  But the seasonally adjusted net balance of respondents reporting an increase in net reservations compared to a year ago had fallen to +29 in the October House Builders’ Federation survey, from +45 in September.  The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors seasonally adjusted sales balance had remained high at +32.  Private housing starts had risen by 4.5% in the three months to October compared to the previous three months, and by 9.0% compared to a year earlier. 25 The latest survey-based estimate produced by Bank staff had suggested GDP growth of 0.8%–0.9% in Q4.  The estimate of  three-month on three-month GDP growth produced by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research had been 0.9% in October and projected to be 0.8% in November.  Turning to the individual surveys, the output expectations balance in the CBI Monthly Trends survey had fallen back a little to +6 in November from +12 in October.  The total orders balance had been above its average at -16, but export order books had been at -33, below their long run average.  The October CBI Industrial Trends survey had shown that manufacturing investment intentions had weakened as the balance of expected capital expenditure on plant and machinery had fallen to -11 in Q3 from -8 in Q2, well below the long-run average.  Monetary Policy Committee 81 26 The headline index of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) manufacturing survey had risen slightly to 54.2 in November.  The output index had been 57.4, above the  no-change value of 50 for the ninth consecutive month, and the highest level since February 1997.  The survey had suggested rather less buoyant export growth than the official data, with the index at 53.1.  Stocks of finished goods had fallen in November, after rising in October for the first time since July 1998.  The CIPS services survey had strengthened to 59.5 in November, the highest level since June 1997, with business activity rising throughout the sector. The CIPS construction index had also been strong at 57.5 in November, with housing and commercial orders remaining robust. But construction new orders had fallen by 5% in the three months to September compared with the previous three months, and had been 16% below their level in the same period in 1998. 27 In its latest Pre-Budget Report, published on 9 November, HM Treasury had revised down its forecast of Public Sector Net Borrowing in 1999/00 by around £6 billion.  Forecast receipts had been revised upwards, reflecting an improved cyclical outlook. Projections for total public sector spending out to 2001/02 had been little changed, although a £0.7 billion underspend in 1998/99 had been carried forward into 1999/00. 28 The Chancellor had announced that the automatic road fuel and tobacco duty escalators would no longer be applied:  decisions on any real increases in these duties would be made by the Chancellor in subsequent Budgets.  Removing the escalators from the fiscal projections had reduced projected receipts by £11/4 billion in 2000/01, rising to £6 billion in 2003/04. 29 The lower overall projections for borrowing had not reflected a tightening of the Government’s desired fiscal stance, which would only be reassessed in the next Budget.  Projections for the structural deficit over the next three years had been little changed.  The Treasury had published a separate document prior to the  Pre-Budget Report assessing the outlook for trend output growth over the next five years.  This had suggested that trend growth could be 21/2% per annum compared with the 21/4% per annum assumed in recent Treasury fiscal forecasts.  Nevertheless, the  fiscal forecasts in the Pre-Budget Report had continued to assume trend growth of 21/4% per annum, as would those in the next Budget. IV The labour market 30 According to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), there had been a sharp increase in employment of 110,000 (0.4%) in Q3, following growth of 0.2% in Q2.  After making an adjustment for the difference in average hours worked by full and part-time staff, employment growth in full-time equivalent terms had been the strongest for more than a year.  Total hours worked had risen by 0.3% during the quarter.  The proportion of the working-age population in employment had risen slightly in Q3, but had remained below the spring 1990 peak. 31 CIPS survey measures of employment growth had been little changed in November.  The surveys suggested that manufacturing employment had again remained stable, services employment had continued to rise moderately, and growth in construction sector employment had remained robust. 32 Unemployment had continued to fall in Q3, by 38,000 on the LFS measure and by 57,000 on the claimant count measure. Almost the entire fall in the LFS measure had been accounted for by a reduction in the number of short-term unemployed (those unemployed for fewer than six months).  The pace of decline in claimant count unemployment had appeared to slow in the most recent data (the claimant count had fallen by 11,000 during September and October, compared with a total of 54,000 in the preceding two months).  However, the ONS were reviewing the seasonal adjustment of these data. 33 According to the Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services (FRES) survey of recruitment agencies, staff shortages had continued to intensify in November.  The Bank’s regional Agents had also reported evidence of rising shortages of both skilled and unskilled staff, particularly in the South. 34 The headline measure of annual growth in average earnings per head, a three-month moving average, had fallen from 4.9% in August to 4.7% in September.  Within the total, the service sector headline measure had fallen by 0.4 percentage points to 5.0%, while the manufacturing measure had risen 0.3 percentage points to 4.0%.  The Reward index had risen by 0.1 percentage points to 3.5% in October.  According to the FRES survey, there had been little change in the rate of earnings growth of either permanent or temporary staff in November. 35 There had been little new information on settlements.  The Bank’s AEI-weighted twelve-month mean settlement had remained at 3.5% in October.  Further details had become available on the proposed three-year deal at Ford.  It had been reported that the first year would combine a pay increase of 4.0% with a cut in basic hours worked.  This would be above the average rate of recent manufacturing settlements in the Bank’s database. 36 Historically, much of the variation in nominal earnings growth had reflected changes in inflation expectations.  The latest data had suggested that real average earnings growth, after adjustment for the surveyed inflation expectations of trade union leaders, might have levelled off at around 2%. V Prices 37 The Bank’s oil-inclusive commodity price index had fallen by 1.0% in October, taking the annual inflation rate from 13.2% to 12.9%.  The monthly fall had reflected price falls in crude oil and all the other major components of the index.  The non-oil index had fallen by 1.3% in October, but had risen by 1.5% on a year earlier. Metal prices had fallen for the first time since June, and domestic food price inflation had remained weak. 38 Seasonally adjusted manufacturing input prices had fallen by 0.1% in October, but the annual inflation rate had increased to 6.3% from 5.8%.  The latest CIPS manufacturing survey input price index had risen to 57.1 in November, the highest for four years. Seasonally adjusted total output prices excluding excise duties (PPIY) had risen by 0.1% in October, to give an annual inflation rate of 0.9%.  The seasonally adjusted CBI output price expectations balance had risen to -7 in November, the highest since February 1998.  In November’s CIPS services survey, the average prices charged index had risen to 53.2, the highest for two and a half years. 39 Prices of exports and imports of goods had risen by 1.5% and 1.0% respectively in the three months to September.  Stripping out the oil component, export prices had fallen by 0.7% and import prices had risen by 0.2% over the same period. 40 The annual rate of change of the GDP deflator had been 1.8% in Q3, the same as in Q2.  Larger rises in the household expenditure and investment deflators had been offset by smaller increases in the government consumption deflator.  The retail sales deflator had fallen by 0.9% in the year to October, the lowest inflation rate in this series on record.  The stronger decline in recent months had reflected slower food price inflation. 41 RPIX inflation had risen by 0.1 percentage points to 2.2% in October.  The gap between services and goods inflation had widened to its highest level since September 1992.  RPIX service price inflation had risen to 3.9%, largely as a result of higher insurance premiums.  RPIX goods price inflation had fallen to 0.4%, mainly reflecting lower food prices.  In the latest CBI Distributive Trades survey, the balance of retailers’ expected prices  Inflation Report:  February 2000 82 had fallen substantially to -1, the lowest figure since the survey had begun in 1983. VI Reports by the Bank’s regional Agents 42 The Bank’s regional Agents had reported a continued moderate recovery in retail sales, though not as strong as the official data had indicated.  Strong demand had continued for computers and mobile phones, and sales of household and electrical goods had risen, reflecting stronger housing activity.  But turnover in the clothing sector had remained weak, and demand for new and used car sales had been below expectations.  It had been reported that customers might be delaying purchases because of expected price reductions in the new year.  Millennium-related stockbuilding had been only moderate, with the exception of food and drink,  and pharmaceutical goods.  Consumer demand for millennium events had also been weaker than had earlier been expected by contacts. 43 Manufacturing investment had continued to be targeted at productivity improvements and opportunities for overseas production.  There had been mixed reports regarding IT investment. Some firms had reported a pause ahead of the New Year, but it was widely expected that IT investment would pick-up strongly from January.  Reports of increases in input prices had become more widespread, but manufacturers had continued to find it difficult to pass these price increases on, and margins had been squeezed further.  This had been particularly true for export-orientated firms. Downward price pressure had continued in most parts of the retail sector. 44 There had been evidence of a further tightening in the labour market.  Skill shortages had continued to increase, particularly in the southern regions of England.  In many service sector industries, forthcoming settlements and other pay awards were expected to be higher than a year ago, reflecting skill shortages and greater profitability.  But in other sectors, such as engineering, where profits had been relatively weak, settlements were expected to be rather lower than in services.  It was widely expected that any upward pressures on wages would have to be absorbed by the employer. VII Market intelligence 45 Market expectations of, and uncertainty over, future interest rates in the UK, the US and the euro area—as measured by the implied rates and implied volatilities on short term interest rate futures respectively—had fallen in early November, following the rises in official interest rates.  The fall in implied volatilities had been greater than that usually seen following monetary policy announcements.  A number of possible reasons for these declines had been suggested in the markets, including a view that interest rates may not be changed again until the New Year, and improved confidence that liquidity needs across the millennium would be met. 46 Interest rates implied by UK short sterling futures had risen again later in the month.  This had reflected renewed uncertainty about near-term rate prospects following the publication of the MPC minutes, reported rises in house prices, upward revisions to international growth forecasts, and a growing view that the millennium date change need not deter the MPC from changing policy in December.  Market prices, surveys and anecdote had suggested some expectation of a December rate rise, although it was seen in the market as less than an even chance. 47 Merger and acquisition news had been supportive for sterling at some points during the month.  Changes in risk reversals traded in the foreign exchange options market had been small over the month, but had suggested that the markets perceived some risk that sterling would rise further against the euro, but fall against the dollar.  Monetary Policy Committee 83 The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee today voted to maintain the Bank’s repo rate at 5.5%. The minutes of the meeting will be published at 9.30 am on Wednesday 22 December. Text of Bank of England press notice of 9 December 1999 Bank of England maintains interest rates at 5.5%  Inflation Report:  February 2000 84 Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 12–13 January 2000 1 Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed the world economy;  money and asset prices; demand and output;  the labour market;  prices and costs;  and other considerations relevant to its decision. The world economy 2 The Committee considered developments in the world economy since the publication of the November Inflation Report. Outside Japan activity in Asia had strengthened perceptibly, as it had in the euro area, which was the single most important market for UK exporters.  According to the most recent estimates,  euro-area GDP had increased by 1% on a quarterly basis in  1999 Q3, with growth in the previous quarter revised up to 0.6%. The recovery now seemed to be spreading to Italy and Germany, in the latter case confirming the more buoyant picture shown by business confidence indicators and orders data, both of which had risen further in recent months. 3 GDP growth in the US in 1999 Q3 had been very strong, at 1.4% on a quarterly basis.  More recently, in December US consumer confidence, as measured by the Conference Board, had risen to its highest level for over 30 years, and non-farm payrolls had continued to increase rapidly.  While labour market data suggested considerable pressure on resources, this was not reflected in the capacity utilisation measures themselves.   4 Although both oil and non-oil commodity prices were rather stronger than had been expected in November, there had as yet been limited pass-through into prices further along the supply chain, particularly at the retail level.  This might reflect lags, or the persistence of spare capacity in the world economy, putting downward pressure on margins.  Alternatively, it might be related to stronger productivity growth, especially in the US.  Following the extensive revisions to past data, most estimates of trend GDP growth in the US had been revised up.  Equity prices might also suggest that expectations of sustainable growth were stronger than previously, but it was too soon to be sure whether such a rerating was valid, or whether stock markets had overshot on the upside. 5 To the extent that the rise in the price of technology stocks reflected expectations of rapid improvements in productivity, the boost to demand associated with the rise in share prices might be greater, at least in the short run, than the supply-side effects from higher future productivity.  The extent to which the rise in the price of technology stocks may have affected consumption was unclear, although increases in wealth more generally helped to explain the low US personal savings ratio. 6 The Committee discussed the implications of these developments for the US balance of payments.  If trend growth in the US were indeed higher, the present current account deficit might narrow once the improvements on the supply side, which were perhaps already being anticipated by higher demand, began to feed through.  If these improvements did not materialise, portfolio investment and capital flows linked to mergers and acquisition business could rapidly reverse, especially if stock markets fell back, with a risk that the dollar might decline sharply.   7 The Committee concluded that while the risks from a fall in stock markets and from current account imbalances remained significant, these had been present for some time and had not changed in degree over the past month or so.  These risks aside, the outlook for world economic growth was now stronger than it had been, and the recovery in Continental Europe, which seemed to have become more firmly based over the past month, was of particular importance to the UK through its prospective effects on net trade. Money and asset prices 8 Narrow money had surged in December, with notes and coin increasing by more than 41/2% in the month, and with the  twelve-month growth rate (of 121/2%) at its highest for twenty years.  This appeared to reflect end-year or end-millennium effects, including greater-than-normal stocking of ATMs and higher cash holdings by the public.  A sharp reversal in the level of notes and coin now seemed to be under way in January.  The Committee agreed that these movements were unlikely to have wider implications for the rest of the economy;  both these and the pattern of retail sales around the turn of the year might be examples of seasonal or millennium ‘fog’ which obscured the underlying position.  By contrast, once allowance was made for the weak growth of deposits by Other Financial Corporations (OFCs),  the underlying growth in broad money was rather stable, at around 6%. 9 M4 lending to households had again been strong, with the twelve-month growth rate the highest for eight years, and the Bank’s estimate for mortgage equity withdrawal had been revised up to £3.8 billion in 1999 Q3.  ‘Borrowing for consumption’—a measure which combined estimates of mortgage equity withdrawal and unsecured lending—was at nearly 5% of disposable income in Q3, its highest level since late 1990. 10 The housing market remained buoyant, with prices rising some 131/2% over the last year on both the Halifax and Nationwide measures, and with house price strength now more widely spread across the UK than before, although significant regional differences remained.  Measures of turnover and housing activity showed a less clear trend, however, and a survey of house prices by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) for December recorded a rather lower figure for the balance of estate agents reporting a rise in house prices. 11 Two-year interest rates had risen by around 30 basis points since the December meeting.  The rise in interest rates had not been offset by a rise in inflation expectations.  Other things being equal, the rise in real interest rates along the yield curve would tend to dampen demand, including via its effect on new fixed-rate mortgages.  So monetary conditions in the UK had clearly tightened over the past month.  This might in part reflect the stronger prospects for world economic activity. 12 In addition, the effective exchange rate index had risen by around 11/4% over the month.  This would exacerbate the impact on net trade of the earlier appreciation, although it would be offset at least in part by the pick-up in world demand.  Meanwhile equity prices in the UK had been rather volatile, rising during December and then falling back, but on balance were little changed over the month, and remained well above the central projection in the November Inflation Report. Demand and output 13 The latest National Accounts data included revisions for the period from 1998 Q1.  While estimates of the level of GDP in  1999 Q3 were little changed, growth in 1998 Q4 had been revised down, with more of a recovery in the following two quarters.  GDP at constant market prices was now estimated to have grown by  0.8% in 1999 Q3 (as against the previous figure of 0.9%) but the year-on-year figure had been revised up to 1.9% (from 1.8%).  Monetary Policy Committee 85 14 Household consumption was still estimated to have risen by 0.6% in 1999 Q3, but the level of consumption was now 0.6% lower than previously estimated, in part reflecting a downward revision to expenditure on cars earlier in 1999 following the changes in the seasonal pattern for vehicle registration.  Business investment had fallen in Q3, and growth in investment as a whole in the quarter was barely positive.  Within the total, manufacturing investment continued to fall, perhaps reflecting past pressure on margins, and there had also been a slight decline in investment by the services sector, after previous estimates had been revised up to show more rapid growth over the previous year.  It was possible that some of the weakness in business investment reflected a pause in IT spending ahead of the new millennium.  Government investment had increased sharply in Q3, although it remained well below planned levels.  The level of government consumption expenditure had been revised down, though growth in Q3 was stronger than previous estimates. 15 Final domestic demand in Q3 was now estimated to be 3.2% above its level of a year earlier, compared with 4.1% in Q2, a figure which had itself been revised down from 4.5% in the previous estimate.  Moreover, it seemed unlikely on present indications that year-on-year growth would pick up significantly from the 3%–31/2% range either in 1999 Q4 or the present quarter.  While such growth was likely to be too high to be sustainable in the long run, it was significantly lower than the 4%–41/2% rates reported earlier in 1999, before the latest revisions had been made.  The quarterly growth rate of final domestic demand had slowed more sharply, from 1.2% in 1999 Q1 to 0.4% in Q3, which if it persisted would no longer be above its sustainable rate.  However, surveys and other evidence suggested that it could pickup in Q4. 16 While final domestic demand growth had fallen back, net external demand had been stronger in Q2 and Q3, making a positive contribution to GDP growth on a quarterly basis (though this might not continue into Q4).  As a result growth in GDP on a year ago was only 0.7 percentage points lower in Q3 than growth in domestic demand, compared with a gap of 2.6 percentage points in 1999 Q1.  To that extent the recovery was now better balanced. The stronger performance of net exports might, if sustained, tend to put pressure on resources unless domestic demand growth continued to moderate.  However, there was spare capacity in  many  export and manufacturing sectors following their recent downturns. 17 There was also some evidence of better balance in the economy from the output data, with both manufacturing and industrial output up 1.2% over the previous quarter in Q3, while the services sector had grown by 0.6%.  Such a recovery in industrial output was consistent with the upturn in external demand from Continental Europe;  but the slowdown in services, which was in part due to lower growth in the financial and business services category, was less easy to explain, unless it reflected a pause ahead of the new millennium. 18 Growth in retail sales volumes (which excluded spending on vehicles) continued to slow on a three month on three month basis, while still running at around 4% at an annual rate.  As always, it was difficult to gauge the underlying pattern of sales over the Christmas and New Year period, and it would be sensible to look at data for December and January together when these became available.  This was even truer this year, given the uncertainties over the impact of the millennium date change.  However, most of the determinants and indicators of consumption (such as real labour incomes, financial and non-financial wealth and household borrowing, as well as consumer confidence) appeared either to be strengthening or to have remained strong, suggesting that consumer spending might continue to grow relatively rapidly in the near future;  this was in line with survey data on retail sales for December.  But car sales seemed to be weak, with some consumers apparently delaying purchases in the hope that prices might fall sharply in the near future. The labour market 19 Whole-economy headline earnings had risen by 4.9% in the year to October, with private sector earnings up by 5.1%.  The headline figures represented a three-month average;  taking the data for October alone, whole-economy earnings were up 5.1% on a year earlier, even though October was not a month in which bonus payments were typically large.  There could be further upwards pressure on the Average Earnings Index in the next few months,  if bonus payments were unusually high, for instance for  millennium-related reasons.  In any case, the figures for October suggested an upward revision to the profile for earnings contained in the central projection in the November Inflation Report. 20 There was some evidence of a recovery in labour productivity in the most recent data, at least part of which was expected for cyclical reasons.  The Inflation Report had built in a recovery in productivity growth, and the increase seen in Q3 provided some support for that assumption.  But unless productivity continued to improve, or pressure on margins intensified further, or the exchange rate continued to strengthen, stronger nominal earnings growth would lead to higher inflation in the medium term. Other indicators of wage pressure were more mixed, and as usual for the time of year there was little new information on settlements. 21 Employment had continued to increase, but at a rather slower pace than in the previous two months, with Labour Force Survey (LFS) employment up 0.2% in the three months to October compared with the previous three months, and other survey data also pointing to slower growth.  Unemployment had fallen again, but on the LFS measure had remained at 5.9%, with some of the rise in employment reflecting, in an accounting sense, a reduction in the numbers of those previously inactive who wanted a job.  The Bank’s regional Agents continued to report that skills shortages had—at least in some areas—increased further but evidence the previous month from both the CBI Industrial Trends survey and the recently introduced CBI/Deloitte Services survey had suggested that skilled labour shortages were still below historical averages. Figures for turnover in the labour market, constructed from P45 job separation data, suggested that job creation might be increasing in gross terms.  A weighted index of employment in manufacturing, services and construction based on data from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) suggested continuing, but rather modest, growth in employment in December, in line with other surveys, such as that by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation. 22 The Committee agreed that the labour market remained tight, and that in underlying terms earnings growth was becoming uncomfortably high, particularly if productivity growth did not pick up further.  This strength might be exaggerated by erratic factors (such as unusually large one-off bonuses) in the coming months, part of which might be millennium-related. Prices and costs 23 Despite the path of labour costs and oil and other commodity prices, retail price inflation remained subdued, with RPIX growing at 2.2% in November, below the 21/2% target for the eighth month in succession.  The strength of the exchange rate was one possible cause;  another was the impact of competition (including via the Internet) which might act to restrain prices.  Such ‘e-tailing’ was now being talked about as increasingly important not just for goods such as books and CDs, but was also seen as likely to become more important for other sectors such as electrical equipment and cars. By shortening the supply chain e-tailing might drive down costs for consumers who bypassed the distributors, and depress margins for the more traditional retailers and other intermediaries.  An overall reduction in distribution costs through greater business-to-business e-commerce might show up as higher productivity in coming years. Alternatively, the effects of such competition might prove either to be transitory or merely to redistribute profits between retailers;  and  Inflation Report:  February 2000 86 reports of squeezes on margins at retailers might suggest that some of these adjustments had already occurred. 24 The Committee noted that the inflation expectations of the general public, as measured in the latest Barclays BASIX survey, had increased in Q4, the first increase since 1998 Q3.  However, since the inflation measure was not specified, this might be no more than a reflection of the widely-expected rise in the RPI measure of inflation, which included mortgage interest payments. Other considerations 25 The Committee discussed whether the change of millennium had given rise to problems of data interpretation, over and above the normal difficulties in identifying underlying developments over the Christmas and New Year period. 26 At its previous meeting, the Committee had reaffirmed that there was no reason for the Y2K period to constrain monetary policy setting in the UK, and had also noted that it was unclear whether any ‘fog’ around the year-end would be much thicker than usual.  So far any Y2K uncertainties had indeed appeared to be rather limited.  While some figures had clearly been affected, such as the narrow money data, adjustments could be made to take account of the distortions.  The pattern of retail sales was not yet clear, but this was typical at this time of year.  The prospect of the new millennium might have had some impact on investment, for instance in IT, though this remained unclear.  That said, many of the backward-looking data were still for periods before the turn of the year, so further distortions in the data might perhaps be expected. 27 The Committee also noted that during the next month it would carry out a new quarterly forecast for the February Inflation Report.  This would allow it to analyse some of the puzzles in the data in more detail, such as the continuing coexistence of relatively subdued retail price inflation, above-trend growth in demand, and a pick-up in earnings growth and commodity prices.  To the extent that uncertainties surrounding some of these issues might soon diminish in a way which informed the policy decision, there was a case for waiting until this had been done.  But to the extent that the news since the previous meeting warranted an increase in rates, there was no reason for a delay, and some members of the Committee had felt that a rise in rates had been needed already in December.   The immediate policy decision 28 The external environment for the UK had strengthened over the past month, as had most of the determinants of domestic demand, including wealth, labour income and household borrowing.  At the same time, final domestic demand in Q3 had slowed, and inflation remained below the 21/2% target.  The Committee discussed the implications of these developments. 29 On one view, the repo rate should be increased by 25 basis points this month.  Various considerations were advanced to support this view, with different members of the Committee placing differing weights on the factors identified. 30 For some, the choice this month was between raising rates by 25 or 50 basis points, but on balance there was no need to move by more than 25 basis points now.  Since the previous meeting, the change in the economy had not been dramatic.  The strengthening in the outlook for the world economy, especially in the euro area, had produced better balanced growth in the UK, but meant that domestic demand growth would need to slow further from its present 3%–31/2% annual rate if it were to be sustainable.  In addition, a more generalised pick-up in world activity might place further upward pressure on commodity prices.  While the very fast growth in narrow money in December seemed largely to reflect transitory factors, the credit figures were more of a concern.  The sharp pickup in borrowing for consumption, from 2% of personal disposable income at the start of 1999 to almost 5% in Q3, coupled with house prices and equity prices well above the central projection in the November Inflation Report, would tend to support robust consumption growth.  This would put upward pressure on inflation in the future, despite a further rise in sterling and a welcome recovery in estimates of productivity growth to rather closer to the long-run trend.  With annual retail sales growth remaining around 4%, further pressure would be placed on resources in the short term if investment recovered following the millennium change.  In addition there was now some evidence that the tightening in the labour market was beginning to feed through into earnings.  Average earnings in the private sector were growing at more than 5% on a year earlier, implying earnings growth well above the central projection in the November Inflation Report. Nevertheless, with inflation at present subdued, the costs of waiting a further month before deciding whether a further change in rates was going to be needed were small;  the February Inflation Report provided an opportunity to carry out more analysis.  Given the uncertainties, a tightening of policy this month by 25 basis points was the appropriate response. 31 Other members of the Committee agreed that an increase of 25 basis points was needed this month, but felt the outlook, particularly for inflation, was rather more benign.  The pace of domestic demand appeared to be slowing and the recent news on GDP growth was in the surprisingly strong export figures, where the economy still had considerable room for growth.  Inflation was still expected to remain below the 21/2% target for some time. Sterling had strengthened further, and some thought that it might rise even more, which would help to restrain prices.  So too might structural changes in the economy over a number of years, perhaps reflecting stronger global competition and greater price sensitivity of consumers as a result of the enhanced price transparency brought about by Internet use.  It was plausible that the growth of  business-to-business e-commerce would lead to a significant reduction in costs.  Average earnings might rise further in coming months, but this would partly reflect one-off factors such as bonuses;  it would be important also to look at settlements data, as well as further microeconomic evidence on margins and productivity.  It was also suggested that if the neutral level of real interest rates were around 3%, as some historical work suggested, and inflation expectations were firmly anchored at 21/2%, a neutral nominal rate would be around 51/2%.  Given the strengthening of the world economy and many of the determinants of UK consumption it was appropriate for monetary policy to be tighter than neutral at present, but not by a great deal, especially given the strength of sterling, and this justified a 25 basis point increase in the repo rate. 32 On another view, an increase of 50 basis points was needed now.  The recovery in the world economy and the remarkable strength in the principal determinants and indicators of consumption—such as real wages, secured and unsecured credit to households, wealth, and consumer confidence—suggested that in the absence of a tightening in monetary policy GDP would continue to grow above trend.  Against this background the slowdown in final domestic demand in Q3 might well prove to be erratic.  Given the strength of nominal earnings growth, it seemed likely that, in the absence of a stronger exchange rate, significant further improvements in productivity growth, or an intensification of the squeeze on margins, greater upward pressure would be placed on inflation in the medium term, even though at present RPIX was rising at less than 21/2%.  An increase in rates of 25 basis points had been needed last month, and given developments since then more was needed now.  The arguments for waiting a further month, for more data and the analysis underlying the February Inflation Report, were insufficient reason for delay:  an increase of 50 basis points in the repo rate was required this month. 33 The Governor invited members of the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate be increased by 25 basis  Monetary Policy Committee 87 points to 5.75%.  Eight members of the Committee (the Governor, Mervyn King, David Clementi, Charles Goodhart, DeAnne Julius, Ian Plenderleith, John Vickers and Sushil Wadhwani) voted for the proposition.  Willem Buiter voted against, preferring an increase of 50 basis points. 34 The following members of the Committee were present: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers Sushil Wadhwani 35 Gus O’Donnell was present as the Treasury representative.  Inflation Report:  February 2000 88 1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by the Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee on 7 January, in advance of its meeting on 12–13 January 2000.  At the start of the MPC meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and that information is included in this Annex. I The international environment 2 The global economy had continued to strengthen.  Growth in the United States and in the euro area had been robust in Q3;  the Japanese economy however remained fragile.  There had also been further signs of a strengthening of the recovery in Asia and a turn around in Latin America.  But it was not yet clear whether some of the strength in activity in Q4 was related to Y2K effects, which would be unwound in 2000, or reflected more permanent developments.  There were still few signs of global inflationary pressure.  Oil prices had fallen back somewhat in early January from the levels achieved in November and December.  Interest rates implied by futures contracts had increased in the United States, Japan and the euro area since early December. 3 US GDP growth in Q3 had been revised up further on an annualised basis, but the quarterly growth rate was unchanged. Investment growth in Q3 had been revised down to 1.7% from 2.0%.  Investment in equipment and software had been strong in Q3, increasing by 3.7%.  Consumer confidence had risen to 141.4, the highest since its all-time high of 142.3 in October 1968. Consumer confidence had been positively correlated with equity prices in recent years.  US non-farm payrolls had risen 315,000 in December after a rise of 222,000 in November;  the unemployment rate had remained at 4.1%.  Annual consumer price inflation had remained at 2.6% in November, although core CPI inflation had risen to 2.2% from 2.1%. 4 Euro-area GDP had risen by 1.0% in Q3.  Final domestic demand and net trade had both made significant positive contributions to the rise in GDP.  In the three largest euro-area economies (Germany, France and Italy) there had been a similar pattern of quarterly growth in Q3.  Euro-area industrial confidence had increased in December, while consumer confidence had remained unchanged.  German industrial production had increased 2.0% in the year to November, following an increase of 1.3% in the year to October.  Strong growth in German manufacturing orders, increasing 12.5% in the year to November, and a pick-up in the IFO survey measure had suggested a further strengthening in activity. Euro-area unemployment had remained at 9.8% in November. Annual inflation in the euro area had risen to 1.6% in November, from 1.4% in October.  The rise in inflation mainly reflected higher energy price inflation. 5 Japanese GDP had fallen by 1.0% in Q3 but was 0.9% higher than a year earlier.  Private demand had remained weak in Q3; private consumption had fallen by 0.2% and non-residential investment had fallen by 0.3%.  According to the December Tankan survey, enterprises’ view of business conditions had improved, although manufacturers’ sentiment had improved by more than that of non-manufacturers.  Retail sales had fallen by 2.4% in November, a decline of 2.9% on a year earlier.  The unemployment rate had fallen by 0.1 percentage point to 4.5% in November, although measured unemployment continued to be depressed by rises in inactivity.  The consumer price index had fallen by 1.2% in the year to November, but excluding food had fallen by only 0.2%. II Monetary and financial conditions 6 Narrow money had grown very rapidly in December.  Notes and coin had increased by 4.6% on the month, after adjustment for seasonality and the introduction of the new 50p and £2 coins.  The twelve-month growth rate had risen to 12.5%, the highest since 1979.  Anecdotal evidence had suggested that a large proportion of December’s growth reflected increased holdings by banks and building societies;  in particular, ATM stocks were thought to have been higher than normal for the time of year.  But the size of these additional bank holdings had been uncertain.  ATM withdrawals had also been consistent with higher cash holdings by the public than over a typical Christmas period. 7 The stock of M4 had risen by £2.6 billion (0.3%) in November, and the twelve-month rate had picked up slightly to 3.2%.  The weakness of M4 reflected the fall in deposits by the other financial corporations’ sector (OFCs) in November, but the M4 holdings of private non-financial corporations (PNFCs) had again risen strongly.  M4 lending (excluding securitisations) had grown by £9.7 billion (1.0%) in November, and the twelve-month growth rate had risen sharply to 8.4%.  Strong borrowing by households and OFCs continued to drive this robust lending growth. 8 Households’ M4 deposits had risen by £2.6 billion (0.5%) in November.  M4 lending to households (excluding securitisations) had grown strongly, rising by £4.8 billion (0.9%) in November. The twelve-month growth rate had picked up to 9.2%, the highest rate since 1991 Q2.  Within total lending to individuals, total net secured lending had risen by £3.8 billion (0.8%) in November, and the twelve-month growth rate had increased to 8.2%.  The value of loan approvals had remained strong (at £10.4 billion).  The stock of outstanding loan approvals had fallen (by £0.5 billion) for the first time since January 1999.  This was thought to reflect both the relative strength of gross lending and a rise in cancellations in November. 9 Total unsecured lending had risen by £1.3 billion (1.2%) in November, but the twelve-month growth rate had declined again (to 13.4%) and had fallen by more than 4 percentage points in the past year.  The Bank’s estimate of mortgage equity withdrawal in  1999 Q3 had been revised upwards to £3.8 billion and ‘total borrowing for consumption’ (defined as mortgage equity withdrawal plus unsecured lending) grew strongly. 10 The M4 deposits of PNFCs had risen by £1.6 billion (1.3%) in November, and the twelve-month growth rate had picked up to 7.3%.  In contrast, M4 lending to PNFCs had risen by only  £0.3 billion (0.1%) in November, and the twelve-month growth rate had declined to 3.1%.  But PNFCs’ total borrowing (including foreign currency borrowing and capital market finance) had increased, with sterling capital issues being particularly strong. 11 OFCs’ M4 deposits had fallen by £1.5 billion (-0.9%) in November, and the twelve-month growth rate had declined further to -7.0%.  But M4 lending to OFCs had risen strongly, by  £4.6 billion (2.2%), and the twelve-month growth rate had picked up sharply to 11.4%. 12 Nominal interest rates from gilts had risen between 30 and 50 basis points on the month, across all maturities.  Short-term nominal forward rates at maturities up to five years had initially fallen following the December MPC meeting, but had subsequently firmed.  Rising interest rate expectations, particularly at the long Annex:  Summary of data presented by Bank staff  Monetary Policy Committee 89 end, had also been evident in other countries over this period. Corporate bond spreads had narrowed since the beginning of January.  Real interest rates derived from index-linked markets had shown little change at the short end, rising slightly at longer maturities.  Survey-based measures of short-term real interest rates had also shown a slight increase in 1999 Q4. 13 Quoted retail rates data suggested that the November rate rise had been fully passed through to time deposit rates, but only partially passed through to sight deposit rates.  The November rate rise had now been fully passed through to standard variable mortgage rates.  The rate on new fixed rate mortgages had risen a little, despite falls in swap rates of the same maturity. 14 Implied forward inflation expectations had risen slightly, mainly reflecting the firming of nominal interest rates.  Changes in survey-based measures of inflation expectations had been, overall, quite mixed over the month, but had shown a small increase in the general public’s inflation expectations over the next two years. 15 Over the month UK equity prices had exhibited volatility, rising before year-end and subsequently falling back.  A similar pattern had been observed in other international equity markets. The FTSE All-Share index had been broadly unchanged since the December MPC meeting, but it had been 7.5% above the November Inflation Report level. 16 The sterling effective exchange rate index had appreciated by 1.3% on the month, and had been 2.6% above the November Inflation Report central projection.  Over the month, there had been little change in sterling against the euro, but sterling had appreciated against the dollar and yen.  Monetary news had not appeared to explain much of these movements, since global interest rate expectations had for the most part risen in parallel. III Demand and output 17 Quarterly GDP growth at constant market prices had been revised down by 0.1 percentage points in the third quarter to 0.8%. Revisions to previous quarters had reduced growth in 1998 Q4, but stronger growth in the first half of 1999 had left the level of GDP in Q3 little changed.  Domestic demand growth had been revised down by 0.2 percentage points to 0.5% in Q3.  This had been partly offset by the contribution made by net trade, which had been revised up from 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points.  GDP in Q3 had been 1.9% higher than the same quarter a year earlier, revised up from 1.8%.  Revisions to previous quarters had changed the pattern of annual GDP growth slightly, leaving the trough in 1998 Q4 and 1999 Q1 shallower. 18 Quarterly growth of household consumption expenditure (including non-profit institutions serving households) had been unchanged at 0.6% in Q3.  However, revisions to previous quarters back to 1998 Q1 had reduced the level of consumption in Q3 by 0.6%.  Much of the downward revision in 1999 Q1 and Q2 had reflected changes in the seasonal pattern of expenditure on cars (which had been significantly affected by the introduction of the new registration month in March 1999).  Quarterly growth in investment in Q3 had been revised down by 0.1 percentage points to 0.1%, but upward revisions to previous quarters, mainly to investment by the ‘other services’ sector, had increased the level of investment in Q3.  Growth in investment in the services sector had slowed during 1999, and manufacturing investment continued to fall in Q3.  Government consumption expenditure growth had been revised upwards to 0.7% in Q3, but downward revisions to previous quarters had left the level 0.3% lower. 19 Final domestic demand in Q3 had been slightly weaker than domestic demand growth because the change in inventories (revised up slightly) had contributed 0.1 percentage points to quarterly GDP growth.  Revisions to previous quarters reduced the amount of destocking in 1998.  Excluding the alignment adjustment, inventories had risen by £230 million in Q3.  The revisions made little difference to the pattern of inventories as a proportion of output. 20 The deficit on trade in goods and services had narrowed in Q3 to £2.9 billion.  Revisions to 1998 data had reduced the overall current account balance for the year to a £0.5 billion deficit from a surplus of £0.1 billion.  Both import and export volumes growth had been strong in Q3 at 4.5% and 6.0% respectively.  Monthly goods data had shown that export volumes had fallen 2.4% in October, while import volumes had remained high.  Exports to  non-EU countries had bounced back slightly in November. 21 Within the household sector, real post tax income had fallen by 2.0% in Q3, but there had been considerable volatility in recent quarters reflecting sharp changes in dividend income.  The household saving ratio had fallen to 4.5% as a result of the fall in income.  Growth in the gross operating surplus of corporations had been revised up in Q3 to 3.5%.  The level of the gross operating surplus in Q3 had been revised up by 5.7%.  Net borrowing by PNFCs had increased as a percentage of GDP in Q3 compared with a year ago. 22 Retail sales volume growth had increased by 0.2% in November, following an upwardly-revised 0.8% rise in October. The three-month on three-month growth rate had continued to slow. The CBI distributive trades survey had shown a positive net balance of 41% of retailers reporting increased sales volumes in December, and a balance of 21% expecting volumes to rise in January. Consumer confidence remained high:  the GfK measure rose by  3 points to a net balance of +1.7 in December.  Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders had shown total new car registrations in December 12.2% up on a year ago, although this comparison had been affected by the new registration month. Registrations for the whole of 1999 had been 2.2% lower than in 1998. 23 The Nationwide measure of annual house price inflation had remained unchanged in December at 13.3%.  The Halifax measure had increased to 13.6%, the highest annual growth rate since August 1989.  The monthly growth rate of the Halifax index had been 2.6% in December, but this followed a fall in November. Housing transactions, measured by the number of particulars delivered, had increased in December, but remained well below the levels seen in the late 1980s.  Data from the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors had shown a fall in the seasonally-adjusted net balance of estate agents reporting price rises in the three months to December.  The sales balance had indicated a fall in the number of transactions. 24 Data on economic activity in the fourth quarter of 1999 had remained strong in general.  The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) manufacturing activity index had increased to 56.1 in December, from 54.7 in the previous month, although the output balance had been broadly flat over the last six months.  The CBI monthly industrial trends survey showed a slight strengthening of orders and output expectations.  The CIPS construction index rose to 58.2 in December, and although the CIPS services index had fallen to 58.3 in December it continued to indicate growth. IV The labour market 25 Employment growth had been more subdued than it had seemed from the previous two months’ data.  LFS employment had increased by 66,000 (0.2%) in the three months to October compared to the previous three months.  Workforce jobs had fallen by 48,000 during Q3.  Both the slower LFS employment growth (by comparison with previous, overlapping, LFS data) and the decline in workforce jobs had been driven by a large fall in  self-employment.  Workforce jobs, however, were generally more volatile than LFS employment.  Most of the increase in LFS employment had been in full-time employment, which rose by  Inflation Report:  February 2000 90 62,000 (0.3%).  Part-time employment had risen by 4,000 (0.1%). As a result, employment growth in full-time equivalent terms had also increased.  Total hours worked had fallen by 0.3% in the three months to October compared with the previous three months, and average hours had fallen. 26 Workforce jobs had been revised following the annual benchmarking exercise to make the data consistent with the most recent Annual Employment Survey.  The impact of these revisions on the data, however, had been relatively small.  Annual productivity growth, calculated using workforce jobs, had increased 0.5 percentage points in Q3, to 1.2%. 27 Survey data confirmed the weaker picture on employment growth.  The CIPS manufacturing survey in December had shown manufacturing employment falling again, after two months of stability.  In the CIPS services and construction surveys employment had continued to grow, but more slowly than in recent months.  The Manpower survey for Q4 had indicated a slowdown in employment growth in all sectors. 28 Despite the weaker employment growth, skill shortages persisted.  The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) survey in December had shown that shortages of agency staff had increased again.  Similarly, the Bank’s Agents had reported that skills shortages persisted and, in some areas, had worsened.  New vacancies reported to jobcentres had also fallen in November, while outflows (including placings) had risen, although both flows were volatile. 29 Unemployment had continued to fall on both the LFS and claimant count measures.  LFS unemployment had fallen by 12,000 and the unemployment rate by 0.1 percentage point in the three months to October compared to the previous three months. Claimant count unemployment had fallen by 10,600 in November from the previous month.  Short-term LFS unemployment had fallen a little, while long-term unemployment had risen.  Dispersion of unemployment rates across regions had declined slightly in Q3. However, dispersion of unemployment rates at the county and travel-to-work area level suggested that regional data may understate the increase in dispersion in recent years. 30 Inactivity had fallen by 17,000 during this period compared to the previous three months, due mainly to a decline in the number of people who wanted a job, but were either not seeking or not available to start.  This reversed the pattern of the previous two quarters. 31 Earnings growth had increased in most sectors.   Whole-economy headline earnings growth had risen 0.2 percentage points to 4.9% in the year to October.  Headline earnings growth in the private sector had risen 0.3 percentage points to 5.1%, while public sector growth had been unchanged at 3.9%.  Earnings growth in both manufacturing and services was also higher. However, the Reward index had again grown by only 3.5% in November. 32 Wages and salaries per head, calculated from the National Accounts, had grown by 4.7% in Q3, the same rate as the  Average Earnings Index.  Following revisions, growth in unit  wage costs had been falling since a peak in 1998 Q4.  The FRES/REC survey had indicated that earnings growth for permanent staff supplied by agencies had remained broadly flat in December, while earnings growth for temporary/contract staff had fallen slightly. 33 There was little new information on settlements, as was typical of this time of year.  The Bank’s AEI-weighted  twelve-month mean had fallen 0.1 percentage point to 3.4% in November.  Public sector and private sector settlement means had both fallen slightly. V Prices 34 Commodity prices had risen in the last month.  The Bank  oil-inclusive commodity price index had risen by 2.9% in November, more than recovering the fall in October, and taking the annual inflation rate to 16.8%, its highest since this series began in 1990.  Most of the increase was accounted for by the rise in the price of crude oil.  While the prices of ‘hard’ commodities (fuels and metals) had been rising month-on-month for some time, the prices of ‘soft’ commodities (mainly food) also rose in November. This meant that the Bank oil-exclusive index, which had been broadly flat since the end of 1998, had also risen in November.  Oil prices rose only slightly in December but were around 150% higher than a year earlier.  There was no evidence to suggest that these price rises were linked to pre-millennium stockpiling, as inventories did not appear to be abnormally high. 35 Manufacturing input prices had risen by 1.7% in November, in part reflecting higher oil prices, taking the annual inflation rate to 9.1%—its highest since September 1995.  The CIPS input price index had fallen slightly in December. 36 There had been a slight pick-up in output price inflation (PPIY), largely reflecting higher prices of petroleum products.  The CBI output price expectation balance, however, had remained well below its long-run average. 37 There had been significant revisions to the National Accounts deflators.  The GDP deflator had risen by 2.4% in the year to 1999 Q3, revised up from 1.8%.  This mainly reflected upward revisions to both the government and consumers’ expenditure deflators since the start of 1998.  The consumers’ expenditure deflator had risen by 2.4% in the year to Q3, revised up from 1.8%;  on the revised data, inflation on this measure eased between Q2 and Q3, in line with RPIX inflation.  The retail sales deflator had risen by 0.2% in November, the first rise in 9 months, leading to a slight fall in the annual rate of deflation. 38 RPIX inflation was 2.2% in November, unchanged  from October.  RPIX service price inflation had remained at  3.9%, while RPIX goods price inflation had picked up slightly to 0.5%. VI Reports by the Bank’s regional Agents 39 The Bank’s regional Agents reported a continued moderate recovery in manufacturing activity, although volume growth had been stronger than value growth in many cases.  There had been little evidence of capacity constraints in manufacturing firms. Service sector output growth had stabilised at a high rate.   IT-related activity had been flat approaching the year-end but it  was expected to resume strongly in the New Year.  There had  been some evidence of increased capacity constraints in the  service sector, mostly as a result of skill shortages.  Construction activity had remained strong overall, but with wide regional variations. 40 Agents reported an improvement in retailers’ year-on-year sales growth in December, with early indications that there had been solid Christmas trading.  New car sales had been broadly flat and the used car market had also remained weak. 41 Manufacturers had continued to find it difficult to pass on increases in input prices, and margins had been squeezed further. In the service sector, input price increases remained easier to  pass through to consumers.  There had been further downward pressure on retail goods prices, particularly food, clothing and electrical goods.  Manufacturing pay settlements in early 2000 were expected to be no higher than a year earlier.  But stronger pressure had been seen in the service sector, mostly reflecting skill shortages.  City bonuses were expected to be much higher than last year.  Monetary Policy Committee 91 VII Market intelligence 42 Market expectations of official UK interest rates implied  by short sterling futures contracts had risen since the previous meeting of the Committee;  most of this movement had occurred  in early January.  A large majority of market participants expected the Committee to increase official interest rates by 25 basis points at its next meeting;  a few predicted a 50 basis point rise.  Interest rate expectations had also risen sharply in the US and euro area, with futures contracts implying that interest rates in each would  be increased by a total of 50 basis points in the first quarter of  2000.  The smooth transition to the Year 2000 had reinforced expectations of rate rises, particularly in the US.  Data releases  in the UK, US, and euro area had been interpreted as signalling stronger global economic prospects. 43 Sterling had appreciated against the dollar during the  month.  It had risen less against the euro, although in late December sterling had reached a new high against the euro.  Some market participants had commented that they expected the euro to appreciate over the next year.  Data releases indicated that the German economy was recovering, and structural reforms in the euro area were in prospect.  On balance, market forecasts for  2000 were for the sterling-dollar exchange rate to remain broadly stable, and for the euro to appreciate against both sterling and the dollar.  Inflation Report:  February 2000 92 Text of Bank of England press notice of 13 January 2000 Bank of England raises interest rates by 0.25% to 5.75% The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee today voted to raise the Bank’s repo rate by 0.25% to 5.75%. The Committee reviewed monetary and economic developments since its previous meeting.  The outlook for world economic activity has strengthened.  Prospective growth in domestic demand remains strong:  increases in wealth, labour income and household borrowing all suggest that consumer spending will continue to grow robustly.  Inflation is currently below the 21/2% target and is expected to remain so for a while, but it is likely to rise above target further ahead, reflecting developing pressures in the labour market and on productive capacity.
