1999-02-10,"Inflation Report February 1999 The Inflation Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff  under the guidance of the members of the Monetary  Policy Committee.  It serves two purposes.  First,  its preparation provides a comprehensive and  forward-looking framework for discussion among MPC  members as an aid to our decision making.  Second, its  publication allows us to share our thinking and explain  the reasons for our decisions to those whom they affect. Although not every member will agree with every  assumption on which our projections are based, the fan  charts represent the MPC’s best collective judgment  about the most likely path for inflation and output, and the uncertainties surrounding those central projections. The Report has been prepared and published by the  Bank of England in accordance with section 18 of the  Bank of England Act 1998. The Monetary Policy Committee: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Alan Budd Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers The Overview of this Inflation Report is available on the Bank’s web site:   www.bankofengland.co.uk/infrep.htm.

Printed by Park Communications Ltd © Bank of England 1999 ISBN 1 85730 191 9 ISSN 1353–6737  i Overview Inflation on the RPIX measure was close to the 21/2% target level for most of last year.  Since the summer, however, economic developments both internationally and in the UK have substantially shifted the balance of risks to future inflation.  This sharp deterioration in prospects for the world economy has worsened the outlook for UK exports, and domestic consumption growth has weakened.  Moreover, the available evidence from the labour market and international price developments suggest that, in relation to demand, inflationary pressures have eased, at least for the time being.  The Monetary Policy Committee has therefore reduced interest rates in recent months with the aim of keeping inflation on track to meet the target. Growth in the world economy in 1998 is likely to have been broadly as expected at the time of the November Inflation Report, but prospects for the period ahead have worsened.  The difficulties facing some emerging market economies were highlighted by the collapse in  mid January of the exchange rate regime in Brazil.  Net capital flows to emerging market economies are likely to fall further, which entails weaker net exports for industrialised countries as a whole.  If world demand growth is not to decline, higher domestic demand growth in those countries will be needed to offset weaker net trade.   The recession in Japan appears likely to be more protracted than previously anticipated.  Prospects for growth this year have weakened in the euro area.  And there are downside risks to the remarkable buoyancy of domestic demand and output growth in the United States, where large external imbalances have been accumulating for some time.  The probable consequences of these international developments and risks for the UK are weaker export growth, and even lower imported inflation.   Aggregate output growth in the UK has slowed broadly as expected at the time of the November Inflation  ii Inflation Report:  February 1999 Report.  Growth in the third quarter of last year was revised down slightly to 0.4%, and the preliminary estimate of fourth-quarter growth was 0.2%.  Survey measures of business and consumer confidence have stabilised since the autumn, albeit at low levels, and there is now somewhat less of a contrast between indications from official and survey data.  But the sharp contrast remains between output growth in the manufacturing and service sectors.  Household expenditure has been weaker than expected in relation to income and wealth, and part of this weakness is expected to persist.  Inventories have grown more than anticipated, perhaps in large part involuntarily, and a substantial unwinding of stocks remains likely in the period ahead.  Public expenditure is set to grow significantly, particularly for investment.  But business investment growth, which has so far remained robust in the service sector, will probably slow sharply despite falls in the cost of capital.  Annual broad money growth has continued to ease, in line with slowing nominal demand growth.  Total credit growth has also moderated.  Within this, unsecured lending to the personal sector continues to grow fast, but there is evidence that this is partly displacing other forms of household borrowing.  The financial positions of both the personal and company sectors appear reasonably sound overall. Unemployment has declined slightly over the past three months, and the claimant count is at its lowest level since 1980.  Employment growth has been strong, despite the slowdown in output growth, though hours worked have grown more moderately.  But recent evidence on vacancies, recruitment intentions and reported skill shortages indicates that the labour market is no longer tightening. The degree of inflationary pressure in the labour market is especially hard to gauge given the continued suspension of the official Average Earnings Index pending the independent review commissioned by the Chancellor.  The available evidence, including information from the Bank’s regional Agents, suggests that private sector wage settlements have stabilised over the past nine months, despite the cumulative tightening of the labour market.  Wage drift—the difference between earnings growth and settlements—is likely to be decreasing at the current stage of the cycle.  Although recent public sector pay settlements were higher than a  iii Overview year ago, and both the Working Time Directive and the National Minimum Wage are likely to increase labour costs to some degree, upward pressure on overall pay growth appears to be easing.  This has led the Committee to lower significantly its profile for nominal earnings growth. This is consistent with lower inflation expectations. Measures of expected inflation—whether based on surveys or on the difference between nominal and index-linked bond yields—have fallen steadily over the past year, in many cases to levels around the 21/2% inflation target.  And headline RPI inflation is likely soon to fall below RPIX inflation for a period as recent cuts in interest rates reduce mortgage interest payments. The current projection for the growth rate of GDP— based on the assumption that the interest rate remains constant at 5.5%—is shown in Chart 1.  The central projection is for the four-quarter rate of GDP growth to slow to between 1/2% and 1% during this year before recovering to around trend by the middle of 2000 as domestic demand picks up.  Quarterly growth is expected to be close to zero in the first half of this year. The corresponding projection for RPIX inflation is shown in Chart 2.  The most likely path is for inflation to stay close to target over the next two years.  But there is considerable uncertainty surrounding this projection, not only because of the current difficulty of assessing labour cost pressure.  Indeed, some Committee members took the view that the inflation profile should be about  0.2 percentage points lower because of somewhat stronger productivity growth, or weaker world prices, than assumed in the central projection. The Monetary Policy Committee has acted in response to deteriorating prospects for external and domestic demand, and the more benign prospect for both imported and labour cost inflation, by reducing interest rates from 7.5% to 5.5% over the past several months.  Output growth at home has fallen—although broadly as expected in the November Report.  The prospect remains one of a temporary slowdown followed by a pick-up of growth to around trend next year.  The inflation outlook is uncertain.  Inflation outturns in the past six months, inflation expectations on most measures, as well as the Committee’s central projection for inflation, are all now close to the 21/2% target level.  Future changes in interest rates will depend upon how the outlook for inflation evolves.

It eased further in the last three months of 1998, largely reflecting a contraction of balance sheets by the non-bank financial sector.  Total M4 lending growth also slowed in 1998 Q4, even though unsecured lending to individuals grew by close to 20% on a year earlier.  World financial markets remained volatile. Government bond prices rose, particularly in the United Kingdom.  And despite a temporary decline following the devaluation of the Brazilian real, equity prices in most major industrialised countries were higher than in the autumn. The MPC has voted to cut the Bank’s repo rate on three occasions since the November Report, by a total of  1.25 percentage points, to 5.5%. 1.1 Money Notes and coin in circulation rose by 0.6% in  January 1999.  The three-month annualised growth rate in notes and coin rose to 6.2% in January, compared with an average rate of growth of 5.3% in 1998.  Growth in notes and coin has in the past been correlated with nominal retail sales, but the rise in notes and coin since October could also have reflected the falling opportunity cost of holding non interest bearing money as interest rates were lowered. Annual growth in broad money slowed to 8.1% in the final quarter of 1998, its lowest rate of growth since 1995 Q2 and down from 11.9% in 1997 Q4 (see  Table 1.A).  Annualised short-term rates of growth were below the twelve-month rate, indicating that annual growth is likely to slow further.  Adjusting for inflation, real broad money growth in the year to 1998 Q4 was 5.6%, down from its peak of 9.1% in 1997 Q2, but still above the average rate of growth since 1992 of 4.3%. The slowdown in real M4 growth is consistent with the weakening outlook for real activity, but historical comparisons suggest that there is often a lag between real M4 and GDP growth (see Chart 1.1).   The medium-term implications of broad money growth for inflation depend on the relationship between nominal Table 1.A Growth rates of M4 and M4 lending(a) Per cent 1998 3 months (b) 6 months (b) 12 months M4 Q1 8.1 9.4 10.0 Q2 9.0 8.6 9.4 Q3 8.7 8.9 9.2 Q4 6.3 7.5 8.1 M4 lending Q1 9.1 9.0 8.4 Q2 6.9 8.0 7.6 Q3 9.4 8.1 8.6 Q4 4.9 7.1 7.6 Source: Bank of England.

But M4 velocity has been unstable over recent decades.  Chart 1.2 shows that the ratio of nominal GDP to the stock of broad money fell sharply in the 1980s and, after stabilising in the early 1990s, has fallen again since 1995.  There was a corresponding rise in M0 velocity during the 1980s (see Chart 1.2).  The shifts in broad and narrow money velocity in the 1980s reflected the impact of financial liberalisation and a variety of financial innovations, which increased sterling deposits but reduced the demand for notes and coin.  These factors appear to have been less important in the 1990s, which would be consistent with the stabilisation of M0 velocity since 1992, but does not explain the continued fall in M4 velocity. Other financial corporations (OFCs) At a sectoral level, the fall in M4 velocity since 1995 has primarily been accounted for by higher deposits by other financial corporations (see Table 1.B).  OFCs are  non-bank financial intermediaries, which specialise in buying and selling financial contracts and securities.  As such, this category covers a wide range of institutions including securities and derivatives dealers;  mutual, unit and investment funds;  and institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance companies. The annual rate of growth in OFCs’ deposits has slowed during the past year.  But growth of 16.0% in the year to 1998 Q4 was still considerably stronger than the growth in either personal or corporate sector deposits.  Annual growth in deposits held by non-bank financial intermediaries has averaged 22.3% since 1995, compared with growth of 6.6% and 6.5% in household and corporate deposits respectively.  So although they hold only around one fifth of the stock of M4, OFCs have accounted for 45% of the increase in aggregate broad money since 1995.  Chart 1.3 shows that excluding these deposits, the rise in broad money growth since 1995 has been much less marked, and remained close to 6% during 1998.  The velocity of M4 excluding other financial corporations has therefore also been more stable since 1995 than aggregate M4 velocity. The implications of the behaviour of deposits held by non-bank financial intermediaries for activity and inflation are not straightforward.  Their demand for money depends largely on portfolio considerations such as the relative rates of return in the money, equity and bond markets, and on assets such as physical capital or land, rather than on the demand for goods and services.

Money and financial markets 5 Previous Reports have highlighted the upside risk to consumption if these balances were run down through purchases of financial assets.  But changes in other financial corporations’ M4 deposits have been closely correlated with changes in their borrowing since 1990 (see Chart 1.4).  And there was a corresponding slowdown in borrowing by non-bank financial institutions in 1998 Q4 (see Section 1.2).  According to the latest Merrill Lynch-Gallup survey, UK fund managers planned to reduce the proportion of their holdings in cash in January for the fifth successive month;  and the share of M4 in pension fund assets fell to 5.3% in January from 6.4% in November.  If OFCs’ M4 growth continues to decline, that could stabilise M4 velocity. Household sector Households’ M4 deposit growth had been on a downward trend since 1997 Q4.  But it picked up in  1998 Q4, and was 6.4% higher than a year earlier, compared with a rise of 6.0% in the previous quarter. One possibility is that the rise in households’ M4 deposit growth reflected a rise in precautionary saving, which would be consistent with the slowdown in consumer spending. Private non-financial corporations (PNFCs) Corporate M4 deposits fell by 0.2% in 1998 Q4, and were only 3.5% higher than a year earlier.  Lower corporate deposit growth could be consistent with the slowdown in nominal demand and a reduction in cashflow (see Section 2). 1.2 Credit Annual growth in bank and building society lending to the rest of the private sector (M4 lending) has slowed in the past year, from 9.0% in 1997 Q4 to 7.6% in 1998 Q4 (see Table 1.A). Concerns about a possible sharp restriction in the amount and/or increase in the price of credit, following the financial turbulence in the autumn, have eased further. The devaluation of the Brazilian real had a significant impact on emerging market debt spreads.  But there was little impact on credit spreads in the major industrialised economies, which remain above their levels at the beginning of 1998, but have fallen since October.  Bank estimates of the real yields on corporate debt for all but the lower credit-rated companies have fallen back to Chart 1.4 OFCs’ M4 deposits and lending(a) 10 20   0  10  20  30  40  50  60 1975 80 85 90 95 + _ Lending Deposits Percentage changes on a year earlier Source:  Bank of England.

Other financial corporations In line with slower growth in OFCs’ M4 deposits, annual growth in M4 lending to the non-bank financial sector has fallen markedly since the end of 1997.  More recently, this slowdown in borrowing has been evident in OFCs’ reverse repo activity.  Reverse repos, which are mostly conducted with OFCs, were £5 billion lower in 1998 Q4 (not seasonally adjusted) than in the previous quarter, and have made a negative contribution to aggregate M4 lending in four of the past five months. Within the non-bank financial sector, borrowing by securities dealers fell by £11.5 billion (seasonally unadjusted) in 1998 Q4.  Lower borrowing probably reflected a desire by the non-bank financial sector to reduce the size of its balance sheets towards the end of the year, in the light of financial market uncertainty and in advance of the introduction of the euro.  These effects could therefore partly be temporary and may subsequently be unwound. Private non-financial corporations The annual rate of growth in M4 lending to the corporate sector rose to 6.4% in 1998 Q4, compared with an average rate of growth of 4.2% since 1992.  That indicates the continued availability of credit to the UK corporate sector.  Chart 1.6 shows that firms tend to finance imbalances between current income and expenditure mainly through borrowing from banks and building societies, rather than through changes in other forms of borrowing or asset holdings.  Many firms rely on short-term debt to finance inventories and working capital, and it is possible that the strength of corporate borrowing has been associated with recent higher levels of inventories (see Section 2). Household sector In contrast with the decline in households’ deposits growth since 1997 Q4, the annual growth rate of M4 lending to households picked up during 1998.  The amount outstanding was 7.5% higher in the final quarter of 1998 than a year earlier.  Total lending to households can be divided into lending secured on dwellings and unsecured lending.  Secured lending, which accounts for about 85% of the stock of borrowing by individuals, has been growing annually by around 6% since 1997 Q1. But growth in unsecured lending, which accounts for the Chart 1.6 Corporate financial balance and M4 lending  flow 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  0  1  2  3 1987 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 + – Per cent of GDP M4 lending flow (a) Financial balance flow Sources:  Bank of England and ONS.

Money and financial markets 7 rest of borrowing by individuals, has picked up markedly during the past four years, and was nearly 19% higher than a year earlier in 1998 Q4 . As a proportion of consumption, unsecured lending rose from almost zero in 1992 to 2.4% in 1998 Q3.  But this may partly reflect a substitution away from other forms of borrowing.  Unsecured lending accounted for only 13.5% of total lending to individuals at the end of 1997, but for nearly one third of the rise in borrowing by individuals during 1998.  Credit card borrowing has been particularly strong (see Chart 1.7).  That probably reflects the growing use of credit cards as a means of payment, and more competitive supply conditions.  The share of new credit card business accounted for by market entrants since 1990 rose from 10.7% in  January 1995 to 22.6% in January 1999.  Conversely, net mortgage equity withdrawal, which was an important source of funding for consumption in the late 1980s, has been negative during much of the present recovery, and was close to zero in 1998 Q3 (see Chart 1.8).  Lower net mortgage equity withdrawal could reflect a number of factors.  In particular, the gradual recovery in the housing market since 1990 probably reduced the demand for equity withdrawal.  Housing turnover has been considerably lower in the 1990s than it was in the previous decade, and house prices remain below their previous peak in real terms.   However, the rise in total borrowing for consumption— consumer credit and mortgage equity withdrawal—does not look remarkable in relation to total household spending (see Chart 1.9).  Compared with the stock of wealth, which has been boosted by the rise in share prices, the level of total indebtedness remains historically low.  And in relation to total income, the level of household debt has been broadly constant during the present recovery, at slightly below the level at the end of the 1980s.  (See Section 2 for a more detailed discussion of recent trends in consumption.) 1.3 Interest rates and asset prices Short-term interest rates The MPC voted to cut the Bank’s repo rate by  0.5 percentage points to 6.25% at its meeting on  9–10 December, and by a further 0.25 percentage points, to 6.0%, on 6–7 January.   At its 3–4 February meeting, the MPC voted to reduce the Bank’s repo rate by another 0.5 percentage points, to 5.5%.

Inflation Report:  February 1999 8 Risk-neutral probability distributions of expected  three-month market rates derived from options prices on 4 November and 3 February are shown in Chart 1.10. Uncertainty about the likely path of interest rates over the next year, as measured by the width of the blue fan, has diminished since November and since interest rates began to be reduced in October.  A smaller weight is being attached to the possibility of a rate rise.  Market expectations as at 3 February for the most likely outcome, shown by the darkest blue band, were for a further fall in interest rates over the next year, to between 5% and 51/4% by the final quarter of 1999.   The US Federal Reserve cut its official rate by  0.25 percentage points on 17 November.  Short-term interest rates among countries participating in EMU converged at 3.0% in advance of the introduction of the euro on 1 January.  Probability distributions of expected three-month market interest rates for the euro area, derived from option price data on euribor contracts, show that short-term rates in the euro area are expected to remain close to their current level over the next year (see Chart 1.11).   The impact of monetary policy on the real economy depends on the real rate of interest, which is not directly observable and depends on inflation expectations. Survey-based measures of UK inflation expectations for the next two years fell during 1998 and are now on average close to the inflation target.  So adjusting the nominal UK interest rate of 5.5% for inflation expectations, the current short-term real rate is likely to be around 3%.  That is somewhat below the average long-run real rate derived from the gilt market since 1982 (see Chart 1.12). Long-term interest rates Nominal yields on UK government bonds at all maturities have been falling since 1996, but have fallen particularly sharply since the November 1998 Report. For example, between 11 November and 3 February, two, ten and fifteen-year yields fell by 74, 71 and 65 basis points to 4.73%, 4.23% and 4.27% respectively. Many of the factors underlying the falls in long-term nominal UK bond yields are likely to be international, rather than specific to the United Kingdom.  But the fall in UK bond yields has been more marked than elsewhere.  The differential between the ten-year UK spot yield and the US Treasury spot yield was negative Chart 1.10 Implied distribution for sterling  three-month interest rate 3.25 3.75 4.25 4.75 5.25 5.75 6.25 6.75 7.25 7.75 8.25 8.75 Per cent 0.00 Expectations as at c.o.b. 4 November 1998 1995 98 96 97 99 3.25 3.75 4.25 4.75 5.25 5.75 6.25 6.75 7.25 7.75 8.25 0.00 1995 96 97 98 99 Expectations as at c.o.b. 3 February 1999 Per cent 8.75 Sources:  LIFFE and Bank of England.

So at any given point, the depth of shading represents the height of the probability density function implied by the markets over a range of outcomes for short-term interest rates.  The markets judge that there is a 10% chance of interest rates being within the darkest, central band at any date.  Each successive pair of bands covers a further 20% of the probability distribution until 90% of the distribution is covered.  The bands widen as the time horizon is extended, indicating  increased uncertainty about interest rate outcomes.

Chart 1.13 shows a combined yield curve derived from German and French government bonds, which can be thought of as representing market interest rate expectations in the euro area.  It shows that implied  long-run forward interest rates for the United Kingdom are below those for the euro area and the United States. However, information derived from swaps data, which includes an implicit credit risk, suggests that sterling nominal forward interest rates are expected to converge with those in the euro area.   Changes in nominal interest rate expectations reflect revisions to expectations about inflation or real interest rates, or both.  A risk premium may also be priced into the nominal yield curves of some countries, reflecting past inflation surprises.  Chart 1.12 shows ten-year forward nominal interest rates since 1982. The expected rate of inflation in the United Kingdom over the next ten years, inferred from conventional and index-linked gilt prices, has fallen sharply since 1997. But it has been little changed since November, at  slightly above the inflation target of 21/2.  The fall in nominal yields since November largely reflects a fall in the real UK yield.  The real yield on index-linked UK government bonds has been falling since 1996, and particularly since October, to below 2%—its lowest level since index-linked bonds were first issued in 1981. International comparisons of real long-term yields are difficult to make, because of the scarcity of index-linked bond issues.  But there has not been a corresponding fall in the real yield on index-linked US bonds.  Previous research suggests that fiscal considerations are important determinants of long-term real world interest rates.  With the exception of Japan, the ratio of debt to GDP has fallen in most major economies since 1996.  Moreover, the move into budget surplus in the United States and the signing of the Stability and Growth Pact by prospective EMU participants suggest that this trend is unlikely to be unwound during the next few years (see Table 1.C). Institutional factors, such as the minimum funding requirement for pension funds, may also have put upward pressure on the price of UK index-linked bonds by raising demand relative to supply.  Nonetheless, the sharp fall in UK real yields relative to those overseas remains difficult to explain, given the underlying determinants.

Inflation Report:  February 1999 10 Equity prices Share prices in the United States, France and the United Kingdom had by mid January reversed most of their falls in the autumn (see Chart 1.14).  There was also some recovery in share prices in a number of emerging market economies, with the exceptions of Russia and Brazil (see Chart 1.15).  The devaluation of the Brazilian real on  13 January led to an immediate fall in global equity prices.  The subsequent decision to allow the real to float triggered a recovery in most of the major markets.   There are a number of possible explanations for the rise in share prices since October.  The value of an equity can be thought of as the discounted stream of real dividend payments derived from that equity.  So changes in equity values reflect changes either in expectations about future real earnings, or in the discount factor, which is made up of a risk-free real return and a risk premium.(1) The  risk-free real return as proxied by the real yield on government bonds has fallen, as noted above.  Chart 1.16 shows that the recent rapid increase in the FT-SE All-Share Index appears to be more closely correlated with falling real bond yields than with rising profits. Estimates of the equity risk premium vary widely, but most have fallen in recent years.  In general, the recovery in share prices in industrialised economies has not been evenly spread between different industrial sectors and firm size.  The box on page 11 considers the sectoral equity price split in the United Kingdom, the major European markets and the United States. The MPC assumes that there is a greater risk of a fall in UK equity prices than of a further rise, relative to the central case assumption of growth in line with nominal demand. Property prices According to data from the Richard Ellis Research Consultancy, annual growth in the capital value of commercial property slowed in December, in line with the decline in rental value for industrial property. Expectations of future rental values are an important determinant of current property prices, in much the same way that current share prices depend on expected future dividends.  Property company share prices have fallen relative to the FT-SE All-Share index since May 1998, and were around 20% lower at the end of 1998 than at the beginning of the year.  According to the Merrill (1) See the box on page 12 of the August 1998 Report for a more detailed discussion.

Money and financial markets 11 Sectoral equity prices Share prices in most of the major industrialised countries have risen since October (see Chart 1.14 in the main text).  But this masks significant differences in share price movements between industrial sectors and between firms of different sizes.  Chart A shows the performance of different sectoral share prices in the United Kingdom since the start of 1998.  Share prices in the utilities, consumer goods and services sectors rose by around 20% between October and the beginning of February, to close to their peaks of mid 1998.  But share prices in general industrials have recovered significantly less of the ground they lost in the summer. During 1998, UK share prices have risen most in sectors that are relatively less exposed to overseas developments. Chart B shows a similar pattern in other major EU markets.  This could suggest that market confidence in either the future growth of export markets or the ability of firms to compete with imports from outside the EU, is less robust than that for the domestic EU economy. In the United States, however, share prices of general industrials and services have moved more closely together (see Chart C).  That may reflect the relatively smaller share of trade in US GDP, notwithstanding the recent weakness in US industrial production and profits.  The share prices of different-sized UK firms have also varied widely.  Chart D shows that since October, share prices of small-capitalisation companies have risen by considerably less than the average.  Another way of looking at relative share price performance is to relate the change in share prices to earnings.  The price:earnings ratio on the FT-SE Non-Financials index reached an  all-time high of 24 in January.  That compared with a value of 21 before the stock market crash in 1987.  By contrast, the price:earnings ratio on small-capitalisation firms was less than 16, down from 29 in March 1998.  It is difficult to find a single explanation for these differences, but one possibility is a rise in the return investors require for holding less-liquid stocks.

Inflation Report:  February 1999 12 Lynch-Gallup survey of fund managers, the net balance expressing a desire to buy property shares has been negative since July 1998. Housing market activity and house price inflation have continued to ease.  The Nationwide measure of annual house price inflation was 7.4% in January, nearly  6 percentage points below its peak at the beginning of 1998.  The Halifax measure of annual house price inflation fell to 4.5% in January, below the 5%–6% band in which it had been for most of 1998.  The less timely measure calculated by the Bank based on Land Registry data also showed a slowdown in annual inflation, to 7.6% in the year to 1998 Q3, compared with 8.9% in the previous quarter.  Regional differences in house price inflation, as measured by the Halifax, have narrowed slightly since 1997 Q4, mainly owing to slowing house price inflation in Greater London and the South East (see Chart 1.17). 1.4 Exchange rates The sterling effective exchange rate index (ERI) averaged 100.1 in the 15 working days up to and including 3 February.  This is the starting-point for the current projection, and is slightly above the central projection for 1999 Q1 implied in the November forecast. Sterling was little changed since November on both  the narrow and the broader measure of the ERI.  The latter also includes some of the Asian and Latin American economies (see Chart 1.18).  And sterling has traded within a fairly narrow range against the euro, between 0.72 and 0.69, since its introduction (see Chart 1.19). Chart 1.20 shows the path for the ERI implied by market nominal interest rate differentials, calculated by comparing UK expected interest rates at different maturities with expected rates overseas.  This method is based on the assumption that, other things being equal, currencies should adjust to equalise the rate of return on assets across countries.  So if UK rates are expected to be above those overseas, sterling is expected to depreciate.  As the chart shows, the path based on expected interest rate differentials implies a slight depreciation of sterling up to the forecast horizon.  But further out, sterling is expected to stabilise and then to appreciate, reflecting expectations for lower relative UK nominal interest rates, as discussed above.

Money and financial markets 13 In constructing its forecast, the MPC makes assumptions about the future path for sterling, conditional on unchanged UK interest rates.  In judging the most likely path for sterling, the MPC takes into account both interest rate differentials and risk considerations.  In the central projection (the modal or most likely case), the sterling ERI is expected to fall to 97.6 at the two-year horizon, but the MPC judges that a larger fall is more likely than a significant rise.  So on average, the sterling ERI is expected to fall to 96.3 in two years’ time. 1.5 Summary UK broad money growth has continued to ease, in line with slowing nominal demand growth.  Unsecured lending to individuals has continued to grow at close to 20% on a year earlier, but this probably reflects a substitution away from other forms of borrowing. Global yields on government bonds continued to fall in line with lower global inflation expectations and lower expected real yields.  The fall in nominal UK bond yields was particularly sharp, primarily reflecting lower real yields, the reasons for which remain something of a puzzle.  The exchange rate was little changed since the November Report, but is expected to depreciate up to the forecast horizon.

UK exports of goods and services fell in 1998 Q3 and global economic prospects have continued to deteriorate, increasing the downside risks for UK trade and output. Consumption growth has also slowed, consumer confidence has fallen sharply, and business confidence remains low.  Reflecting these developments, GDP increased by only 0.2% in 1998 Q4, its slowest quarterly growth rate since 1992 Q2.   2.1 External demand(1) The growth rate of UK export volumes for goods and services has slowed markedly since mid 1997, largely reflecting weaker exports of goods to non-EU countries (see Charts 2.1 and 2.2).  In particular, the recession in Japan, the financial crisis in East Asia, and the marked fall in the price of oil since January 1997 have caused a sharp contraction in demand among Asian economies and oil-exporting nations (see Table 2.A).  Even though these countries are the destination for only about 15% of UK exports, the decline in their demand for UK goods has been large enough to offset the continued growth in exports to other regions. In contrast, activity has so far been sustained in Europe and stronger than expected in North America (the destinations for two thirds of UK exports).  Euro-area GDP rose by 2.4% in the year to 1998 Q3, and US GDP increased by 4.1% in the year to 1998 Q4.  However, even in these countries, the impact of the Asian downturn and the slowdown in Middle Eastern and South American economies is beginning to be felt. Business confidence fell last year in both Europe and the United States (see Chart 2.3), and the growth rate of industrial production has also slowed (see Chart 2.4). Consequently, growth prospects for most industrialised countries have worsened. World trade forecasts have been revised downwards as a result of these developments.  Between October and December, the IMF lowered its projections for world trade growth in 1998 and 1999 by a further 0.3 and  (1) For a detailed discussion of international economic developments, see ‘The international environment’ article in the Quarterly Bulletin, February 1999, pages 20–32.

Demand and output 15 0.2 percentage points, to 3.4% and 4.4% respectively (see Chart 2.5 and Table 2.B).  These figures are well below the growth rate recorded in 1997.  However, because Asian countries account for around 27% of world trade flows, but make up less than 9% of UK exports, the slowdown in the growth rate of UK export markets is unlikely to be as sharp as the slowdown in world trade. Despite the stronger-than-expected growth in the United States, global economic conditions have continued to deteriorate.  Consequently, some of the downside risks to external demand identified in the November Inflation Report have materialised, and the MPC has revised down its expectation for UK export market growth in 1999 and 2000 to around 4%–5%.  These projections are about  2 percentage points lower than at the time of the November Report.  Moreover, given the lagged effects of sterling’s appreciation, UK exports are likely to grow less quickly than (weighted) UK export markets. Taking exports and imports together, net trade detracted from GDP growth in 1998 Q3—the sixth time this has happened in the past seven quarters.  This reflected both relative demand developments and the competitiveness effects associated with sterling’s appreciation (see Chart 2.6).  Given the slowdown in the domestic economy, demand growth in the major six overseas countries could well exceed that in the United Kingdom this year, and so start to support net trade.  But without a recovery in demand in Asia and the oil-exporting nations, it seems unlikely that the United Kingdom’s overall trade position will improve significantly. Competitiveness effects are also likely to limit the extent of any turnaround in the UK trade position.  The real sterling effective exchange rate appreciated by around one third (depending on which price deflator is used) between the beginning of 1996 and mid 1998.  This was sterling’s largest real appreciation since the early 1980s, and only a small part of it has since been unwound. Given the size of this competitiveness loss, the deterioration in the net trade position in the six quarters to 1998 Q3 was smaller than anticipated.  This was mainly because of weaker-than-expected import penetration. So it remains likely that net trade will make another negative contribution to growth this year.  The risks to this central projection are more balanced than at the time of the November Report but probably still lie marginally Source:  Datastream.

Inflation Report:  February 1999 16 on the downside.  First, import penetration may rise, partly as a result of continued weak import prices— excess world capacity for a number of commodities and traded goods is likely to persist in 1999.  Second, given the continued weakness of the Japanese economy, the emerging market nations in Asia are likely to try to expand their exports to Europe and North America, which would increase the competition faced by internationally exposed UK firms.  And third, the Brazilian authorities’ decision to float the real is likely to have further unsettled international investor sentiment. Depending on the degree of contagion, this may cause another fall in capital flows to emerging market economies, forcing these countries to adjust their current account balances by reducing imports and expanding exports.  The counterpart will be larger current account deficits (or smaller surpluses) in advanced economies, including the United Kingdom.    2.2 Domestic demand Despite slower private and government consumption growth, domestic demand increased by 0.8% in  1998 Q3, up from 0.5% in the second quarter.  This was mainly because of stronger investment (see Table 2.C). In the year to 1998 Q3, domestic demand increased by 3.7%, well above trend.  However, the level of domestic demand in the first half of 1998 was revised down by 0.5%. Consumption Household consumption growth has weakened since the November Report—the quarterly growth rate slowed to 0.3% in 1998 Q3, lowering the annual rate of increase to 2.6%.  In addition, the ONS has revised down the profile of consumption back to the start of 1997 (see Chart 2.7). Although the latest annual growth rate is close to the long-run average (see Chart 2.8), the slowdown in 1998 was sharper than the MPC had expected, given the continued strong increases in pre-tax income from employment (up by around 4% in real terms in the year to 1998 Q3) and the large rise in households’ real wealth in recent years. In Q4, retail sales volumes fell by 0.2%, suggesting that total household consumption growth may have continued to slow in the last three months of the year. Surveys by the British Retail Consortium and the CBI found that retail sales growth declined markedly towards the end of the year.

Demand and output 17 measures of consumer confidence declined further in the fourth quarter, with a particularly pronounced fall in the MORI measure (see Chart 2.9).  However, these indicators may overstate the weakness of consumption— retail sales account for less than half of total consumption, and survey measures of individuals’ confidence in the general economic situation have recovered slightly since October. The slowdown in consumption in the third quarter was accounted for by lower expenditure on both durable and non-durable goods;  spending on services remained strong.  Movements in these household expenditure components have diverged for some time, in contrast with the more synchronised nature of the slowdown prior to the 1990–92 recession.  As Chart 2.10 shows, the annual growth rate of spending on non-durable goods peaked in 1996 Q3 and has since declined steadily, whereas the deceleration in durable goods spending began only in 1998 Q1, and the growth rate of spending on services has yet to moderate. The relative weakness of spending on durable and  non-durable goods in 1998 is a puzzle.  To some extent, the former was influenced by the pattern of windfall payouts arising from the demutualisation of a number of large building societies (see Chart 2.11).  These payouts totalled around £37 billion in 1997 (equivalent to 71/2% of annual household consumption).  In August 1997, the Bank commissioned MORI to survey the beneficiaries of these demutualisations to find out what they were likely to do with their windfall payouts.(1) Using this information, the MPC estimated that domestic demand expenditures would be boosted between 1997–99 by £6–12 billion, with the most likely outcome towards the top of this range. Survey respondents also indicated that around three quarters of the windfall spending would be on durable goods and home improvements.  Although difficult to measure precisely, there is some evidence that spending on these items was boosted above trend by around £4–6 billion in the past two years.  So the sharp slowdown in the growth rate of durable goods spending in 1998 may have reflected the unwinding of this effect. However, there is little evidence that spending on  non-durable goods was boosted by windfall payouts. This suggests that the overall windfalls impact on consumption was probably less than the MPC had previously assumed. (1) See the box on page 20 of the November 1997 Report.

Inflation Report:  February 1999 18 There are a number of other possible reasons for the slowdown in household expenditure, but no single factor provides a convincing explanation.  The first possibility is that concerns about future economic prospects adversely affected consumer confidence and households’ employment expectations.  This is likely to have been associated with increased uncertainty about future income, and may have led consumers to postpone expenditures on big-ticket items, thereby raising precautionary saving.  But this explanation does not explain the weakness of spending on non-durable goods. A second possibility is that fiscal tightening embodied in recent tax changes affected consumption more than previously thought.  Some evidence to support this can be found in Government revenue figures—in the first three quarters of 1998, income taxes were more than 14% higher than in the same period in 1997.  This effect, combined with a sharp fall in net property income (which includes equity dividends), produced a marked slowdown in the growth rate of real personal disposable income (see Chart 2.12). In its previous projections for the public finances, the MPC took as its central case the effective tax rates embodied in the Chancellor’s Budget statements.  These incorporated estimates of the effects of the July 1997 Budget changes on dividend tax credits, which led to significant increases in net income tax receipts.  They also made allowance for the introduction of the new system of Self Assessment (SA) for income tax. However, since there were no changes in personal tax rates accompanying the introduction of SA, HM Treasury assumed that the new system would have only a small positive impact on the effective tax rate.  This assumption now appears to have been an underestimate. One possible explanation for this is that the increased publicity surrounding the launch of the new forms and their more comprehensive and structured layout may have increased the rate of tax compliance by more than was expected.  Unfortunately, it is still too early to draw any firm conclusions, as the seasonal pattern of tax payments will have changed as a result of the extension to the returns deadline from 1 January to 31 January. A third potential explanation for lower-than-expected household expenditure growth relates to the uncertain impact of wealth effects on consumption.  Although net wealth has increased strongly in each of the past four years, real long-term interest rates have also fallen significantly (see Section 1).  These two developments Chart 2.10 Comparison of household consumption  behaviour  Durable goods Non-durable goods Total services 1987 88 89 90 91 92 93 20 10 0 10 20 Percentage changes on a year earlier 1993 94 95 96 97 98 0 5 10 15 20 1998 slowdown Percentage changes on a year earlier + _ 1990–92 recession Chart 2.11 Windfalls and real consumption growth 0 5 10 15 25 30 35 1995 96 97 98  4  2 0 2 4 6 8 10 £ billions Durables     Percentage changes on a quarter earlier Total consumption  growth (left-hand scale) Windfall payouts  20 consumption growth  (left-hand scale) (right-hand scale) + – Chart 2.12 Real personal disposable income and  household consumption growth 1990 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Percentage changes on a year earlier RPDI Consumption + –  Demand and output 19 are likely to be linked, and may have opposing effects on consumption.  Higher wealth is beneficial for consumers, but the impact of lower real interest rates is less certain. As real interest rates fall, households may choose to reduce current consumption out of wealth, in order to maintain their desired future income and consumption— the income effect.  But the returns on new saving also decline, so individuals will tend to save less and consume more—the substitution effect—unless the reduction in the real interest rates is itself the result of a desire to  save more.  The overall impact on household expenditure will therefore depend on the balance between  the income, substitution and wealth effects.  The  worse-than-expected consumption outturn could be related to a larger-than-expected income effect. Alternatively, consumption growth may have been underestimated last year.  In the four quarters to  1998 Q3, the income-based measure of GDP (GDP(I)) increased by 2.9%, the output-based estimate (GDP(O)) rose by 2.6%, and the expenditure-based estimate (GDP(E)) grew by 2.0% (see Chart 2.13).  There is therefore a reasonable chance either that GDP(I) will be revised downwards during the annual balancing of the national accounts, or that GDP(E) will be revised upwards, or both.  Such revisions would help to explain the apparent weakness of consumption relative to the strength of income from employment.  The ONS generally considers GDP(O) to provide the best estimate of recent quarterly growth,(1) which adds weight to the idea that GDP(E) could be revised up and GDP(I) revised down. Overall, the Committee decided not to treat all of the weaker outturn for consumption as erratic.  The central projection for the level of consumption in relation to income has therefore been revised down from the November projection. Investment demand Although investment growth slowed last year, it remained relatively robust.  Whole-economy investment expenditure increased by around 1% in Q3, driven by higher business and general government investment; private sector spending on dwellings declined.  The ratio of business investment to GDP reached another post-war peak in 1998 Q3.

Most of these indicators suggest that the pace of investment growth will slow this year. Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector has fallen relative to its January 1998 peak, reducing the short-term need for new investment.  And the number of UK companies issuing profit warnings increased by more than 50% in the year to 1998 Q4 (albeit from a low base).  The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) survey similarly found that firms’ confidence in profitability remained low in both the manufacturing and service sectors in 1998 Q4 (see Chart 2.14). Because retained earnings provide the largest share of investment financing for most firms, expected lower profits will affect capital expenditure decisions in 1999. However, external financing is also important.  The real cost of borrowing faced by firms is likely to have fallen in the last few months, because of lower interest rates charged by banks, lower real bond yields and increased equity prices (see Section 1).  Overall, therefore, the real cost of capital faced by most firms seems unlikely to be a constraint on investment decisions at present.  Survey evidence supports this conclusion—in recent CBI surveys, only a small fraction of manufacturing firms reported that the cost of finance was likely to limit capital expenditure in the next twelve months. Survey evidence suggests that the overall growth rate of business investment will slow sharply this year and may well turn negative (see Charts 2.15 and 2.16). Investment intentions in the manufacturing sector remain very subdued.  They have also weakened in the service sector, though the latest BCC survey balance remained positive, indicating continued increases in capital expenditure.   Real general government investment in the second and third quarters of 1998 was 2.4% higher than in the same period a year earlier, following a fall of more than 12% in financial year 1997/98.  As the November  Pre-Budget Report indicated a 5.6% increase in the nominal capital budget for this financial year, it seems likely that the growth rate of real government investment will continue to increase in 1998 Q4 and 1999 Q1. Looking further ahead, the Government has committed itself to doubling the ratio of public sector net investment to GDP over the next three years.  So the growth rate of government capital expenditure is likely Chart 2.14 Confidence in profitability 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 1989 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 Service sector Manufacturing sector Percentage point balance + – Source:  BCC.

Millennium-related construction spending will probably also boost investment this year and may bring some expenditures forward, though it may lead to some substitution between private and public investment spending.(1) Inventory investment There is evidence that the slowdown in consumption growth took some firms by surprise, causing an involuntary accumulation of inventories.  Between the first and third quarters of 1998, manufacturing and  retail sector stock-output ratios for finished goods increased by 13/4 percentage points and 23/4 percentage points respectively.  In addition, CBI surveys have  found that the balance of manufacturing firms reporting more-than-adequate inventory levels increased in both Q3 and Q4 last year, to the highest levels since  1991.  However, there appears to be less of an  inventory overhang in the retail and wholesale sectors: the number of firms reporting to the CBI Distributive Trades Survey that stock levels increased relative  to expected sales fell back in Q4, and the January balance for this question was around its long-term average value. At the whole-economy level, inventories (excluding the alignment adjustment) increased by £0.8 billion in  1998 Q3, slightly less than in the first and second quarters (see Chart 2.17).  This pushed the  whole-economy stock-output ratio up by 0.1 percentage point.  As in the November central projection, it is likely that inventories will detract from GDP growth this year. Public sector demand Real general government consumption increased by 2.2% in the year to 1998 Q3, broadly in line with this year’s planned spending.  In assessing the outlook for the public finances, the MPC has taken as its central case the nominal government expenditure plans and effective tax rates from the pre-Budget statement published on 3 November.  The Government intends to expand current nominal spending by almost 6% in financial year 1999/2000, up from around 31/2% in the current financial year.  On the basis of the MPC’s latest inflation forecast, this implies that the growth rate of real spending will also increase. (1) For more details, see box on page 20 of the November 1998 Report.

Inflation Report:  February 1999 22 Given the larger-than-expected increase in income tax payments, the overall fiscal stance in 1998 was probably tighter than the MPC had previously assumed.  On the basis of already-announced government expenditure plans, the overall stance of fiscal policy, on a cyclically adjusted basis, is unlikely to change much between this financial year and the next. 2.3 Output According to the preliminary estimate, the quarterly growth rate of GDP (at constant market prices) decreased to 0.2% in 1998 Q4, from 0.4% in the third quarter.  This lowered the annual rate of increase to 1.6% (see Chart 2.18), in line with the MPC’s central projection at the time of the November Report. The growth rates of industrial production and service sector output still differ markedly, largely because the industrial sector is more exposed to international trade (see Chart 2.19).  Although service sector output growth slowed to 0.6% in 1998 Q4, the 2.9% annual rate of increase remains above its long-run trend.  By contrast, industrial production fell by 0.8% in the three months to November, and the average level of production in October and November was only 0.6% higher than a year earlier. In the manufacturing sector, output fell in November for the fourth month in succession, leaving it 0.2% below a year earlier.  Survey evidence continues to indicate very weak business confidence.  Although the CBI’s measure of overall optimism about the business situation improved in January, the balance remains at its lowest level since January 1991.  The balance of manufacturing firms expecting output to rise over the next four months was at broadly similar levels.  And the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) general  index fell to 42 in 1998 Q4, well below the neutral level of 50. Construction output declined by 0.6% in 1998 Q3, after a 31/2% fall in Q2.  As a consequence, the annual growth rate has slowed sharply, to 0.4%.  Furthermore, activity does not seem to have picked up much in the fourth quarter;  new construction orders in October and November were much lower than the average Q3 level. Similarly, the CIPS survey measure of construction activity averaged 45.5 in 1998 Q4, well below the balance of 51.5 in the third quarter.  In contrast, activity in the energy extraction and supply industries has been Chart 2.18 GDP growth rate(a) 1993 94 95 96 97 98 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Quarter on a year earlier Quarter on previous quarter Percentage changes Chart 2.19 Annual growth rate of GDP 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1993   94   95   96   97   98 Percentage changes on a year earlier Services GDP Manufacturing + – 0 (a) At 1995 market prices.  Demand and output 23 more buoyant—in the three months to November, output in these sectors was 4.2% higher than in the same period a year earlier. Survey evidence suggests that service sector activity will continue to slow this year.  The BCC’s measure of turnover confidence among service sector firms fell for the fifth successive quarter in 1998 Q4, as the balance of firms reporting a rise in both domestic and export orders declined.  Similarly, the CIPS indicators of service sector activity also deteriorated in the fourth quarter.  The business activity index averaged 49.1 in 1998 Q4, down from 54.7 in the third quarter, and the measure of incoming new business fell by 5 points to 47.4.  In both cases, readings below 50 indicate falling activity. 2.4 Summary Global economic conditions have continued to deteriorate since the November Inflation Report, with the impact of the sharp contraction in demand in Asia and the oil-exporting countries increasingly evident in UK export figures.  Domestically, although the slowdown in GDP growth to 0.2% in 1998 Q4 was consistent with the MPC’s central expectation at the time of the November Inflation Report, the composition of this growth differed from that anticipated.  In particular, consumption decelerated faster than expected.  And consumer confidence, business optimism and investment intentions remain weak, suggesting that activity is likely to be subdued in the first half of this year.  24 3 The labour market Chart 3.1 Old and revised headline measures of the  Average Earnings Index (suspended) 2.75 3.00 3.25 3.50 3.75 4.00 4.25 4.50 4.75 5.00 5.25 5.50 5.75 Percentage changes on a year earlier Average Earnings   Index (revised) (a) Average Earnings   Index (old) (a) 1995            96              97            98 0.00 Chart 3.2 Alternative measures of nominal earnings  growth 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 1994 95 96 97 98 Average Earnings   Index (revised,   suspended)    Reward Index Wages and salaries (a)    (National Accounts)  Percentage changes on a year earlier Employment growth has been strong and inactivity has fallen.  Unemployment has continued to edge down, but the LFS unemployment rate, which stands at 6.2%, has been relatively stable in recent months.  Recent survey evidence suggests a moderation in recruitment intentions and some alleviation of skill shortages. Last November, the ONS suspended publication of the Average Earnings Index, pending the outcome of an independent review commissioned by the Chancellor. Other evidence on nominal earnings behaviour, including settlements, analysis of the components of wage drift, and a fall in inflation expectations, appears consistent with an easing of upward pressure on nominal earnings growth. 3.1 Earnings The underlying rate of earnings growth, a key indicator of domestic inflationary pressure, remains hard to assess. The rebasing of, and revisions to, the official earnings data in October 1998 made the growth of the Average Earnings Index (AEI) volatile and difficult to reconcile with other information on pay and on the state of the labour market generally.(1) Chart 3.1 shows the reported profile of nominal earnings growth under the old and revised AEI measures.  The two series differ considerably, especially during 1997 and in 1998 Q1. Consequently, on 2 November, the ONS announced a suspension of the AEI, pending an independent review of the series commissioned by the Chancellor.  The suspension means that there is greater-than-usual uncertainty about recent earnings behaviour and its likely future path. There are a number of sources of information about earnings growth other than the AEI.  Chart 3.2 compares the revised AEI with wage and salary data from the National Accounts, and earnings growth based on the Reward Index, an independent survey covering some 860,000 employees.  Growth in National Accounts measures of wages and salaries per head was estimated at 4.4% in the year to 1998 Q3, compared with a revised Note:  The Average Earnings Index was suspended on 2 November 1998.

These estimates are partly derived from the AEI, and its suspension has meant that the ONS has based its measure of wage and salary growth on other sources.  So it is difficult to draw clear inferences from these data.  But the Reward Index also suggests that earnings growth may have slowed in recent months.   Data on wage settlements also shed light on earnings behaviour.  Basic wages account for a substantial proportion of total earnings, so there is a close relationship between wage settlements—the annual increase in the basic wage—and earnings growth.(1) The Bank’s estimate of the twelve-month employment-weighted mean wage settlement has been unchanged for the past nine months, at around 3.7%. Estimates of private and public wage settlements have also changed little since the November Report (see  Chart 3.3). On 1 February, the Government announced its decision to accept all the main pay recommendations of the pay review bodies.  For the 1999/2000 financial year, the results of the review bodies imply an average rise of 4.1% in public sector pay for the employees concerned, to be met from resources allocated under the Comprehensive Spending Review.  These pay settlements will not be staged.  Settlements were paid in two stages during the 1998/99 financial year, in April and December.  So public sector earnings growth between April and December 1999 will be temporarily higher than the average rise, to the extent of the second- stage payments. Wage drift, the difference between earnings growth and settlements, incorporates factors such as overtime payments, shift premia and bonuses.  The components of wage drift are likely to be responsive to demand conditions.  As Chart 3.4 shows, there has been a close correlation between the growth of overtime payments, as measured by the New Earnings Survey (NES), and the growth of GDP since the mid 1980s.  And the available evidence, including that from the Bank’s regional Agencies presented to the July meeting of the MPC, suggests that an important factor underpinning bonuses is corporate profits, particularly in the year preceding bonus payments.  Corporate profit growth slowed during 1998.  More recent evidence from the Agencies has Source:  Bank of England. (1) The May 1997 Report and a box on page 27 of the August 1993 Report discuss the relationship between wage settlements and earnings inflation in depth.  They note that turning-points in settlements and earnings roughly coincide and that, if anything, past experience suggests that earnings growth appears to lead settlements.  So settlements may, in part, consolidate past wage drift.  Inflation Report:  February 1999 26 pointed to lower overtime and bonus payments.  So whole-economy wage drift may have lessened in recent months. The Bank’s regional Agents reported that more companies are expecting lower settlements this year than higher.  But the outlook for growth in total earnings per head is less clear.  Some firms cite the inflation outlook and company prospects as important factors exerting downward pressure on earnings growth;  but other factors, such as the need to retain and recruit staff, have contributed to upward pressure on earnings growth, particularly in the service sector.  The effects of the Working Time Directive (WTD) and the National Minimum Wage may also be influencing the outlook for growth in earnings per head—a number of firms have not yet adjusted wages to take account of these policy changes. Wage-bargainers implicitly negotiate over expected future real wages, which depend on expected future inflation.  In particular, lower inflation expectations tend to result in lower rates of increase in nominal wages.  As noted in Section 1, financial market based measures of inflation expectations have been steadily falling since 1997.  RPI inflation expectations according to the Basix Survey have also fallen.  The survey captures the inflation expectations of a broad range of labour market participants and others, and so is perhaps more likely to shed light on the wage bargain than measures derived from financial market data.  As Table 3.A shows, one and two year ahead inflation expectations of business people, academics, trade unions and the general public mostly fell significantly between 1998 Q3 and 1998 Q4. When bargaining over real wages, employers focus on the real product wage, which compares total labour cost per employee with the post-tax price of goods and services sold.  Employees, on the other hand, care about the real consumption wage—the wage received relative to retail prices and personal taxation.  If the prices of goods and services charged by domestic producers, net  of tax, were expected to rise at a different rate from prices of goods and services bought by workers, this could drive a wedge between the growth rates of real product and consumption wages.  The wedge might increase if there were a fall in the terms of trade (the price of exports relative to imports) or if taxation increased.  This would tend to reduce labour supply relative to demand, and could raise the level of real wage pressure in the economy.

(a) Figures refer to RPI inflation, except for General public, for which the measure of inflation is not specified.  The labour market 27 Measures of real consumption and product wages would ideally incorporate expectations of the appropriate consumer and producer price indices.  But such measures are either imprecise or unavailable, and so actual price outturns must be relied upon to calculate the real wages relevant to firms and households.  Estimates based on the National Accounts suggest that real product wages grew at an annual rate of 3.4% in the year to Q3, compared with real consumption wage growth of 1.0%. This might seem to imply some upward real wage pressure.  But part of the reason why real product wages have outpaced real consumption wages lies in increased mortgage interest payments, a reduction in mortgage interest relief and increased council taxation.  This has led to relatively higher inflation in the Tax and Price Index (TPI), used to calculate the real consumption wage.  The recent cuts in interest rates are likely to reduce inflation as measured by the TPI (see Section 4), and so the wedge is likely to diminish. In judging the most likely path for nominal earnings, the MPC has taken into account the fall in inflation expectations in recent months and has lowered the inflation expectations profile used in the central projection.  And in light of the evidence from settlements, the components of drift, and alternative measures of earnings, the MPC has decided to further lower the profile for nominal earnings growth in the central projection, compared with the November Report. The MPC has taken account of the more-than-usual uncertainty surrounding the news on earnings by increasing the variance around its projections for earnings growth. 3.2 Employment and unemployment Recent employment data have been strong (see  Chart 3.5).  Employment, as measured by the LFS, rose by 98,000 (0.4%) in the three months to November.  The employment rate rose to 73.8% in October from 73.2% a year ago—its highest level since 1990.  And according to the Workforce jobs survey, employment increased by 97,000 in 1998 Q3, a rise of 0.4%, after falling in  1998 Q2.  Recent revisions to the Workforce jobs survey have increased the estimated level of employee jobs by some 450,000 since September 1997, and increased the rate of employment growth during 1997.  The two measures differ because the Workforce measure is based on a survey of the number of employee jobs, whereas the LFS measure is based on the number of people in work.  But both suggest that employment rose Chart 3.5 Employment growth 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5  0.0  0.1  0.2  0.3  0.4  0.5  0.6  0.7 1996 97 98 Workforce jobs LFS (a) + – Percentage changes on a quarter earlier (a) Note:  LFS data centred around March, June, September and December.

The MPC’s projections for inflation and output are based on the LFS measure, and are therefore unaffected by the revisions to the Workforce jobs survey.   The increase in employment has been reflected in falls in both unemployment and inactivity.  According to the most recent data, LFS unemployment fell by 26,000 in the three months to November, compared with the previous three months, and claimant unemployment fell by 14,000 in December.  Chart 3.6 shows the recent behaviour of LFS, claimant-count and short-term unemployment.  These measures all suggest that unemployment remains very low by recent historical standards—the claimant unemployment rate is at its lowest level since 1980.  But there are signs that the downward trend in unemployment has flattened.  Both the LFS unemployment rate and the claimant-count rate have edged down only slightly in recent months, and were at 6.2% in the three months to November and 4.6% in December respectively.  So the relatively stable behaviour of unemployment in the face of rising employment is largely accounted for by falling inactivity.  Inactivity fell by 36,000 in the three months to November, and by 0.9% on a year earlier.  This reflects a fall in the number of people not wanting a job, including, among other things, an increase in part-time work by women not previously counted as part of the labour force.  Overall inactivity rates have been largely unchanged since 1992.  But when allowances are made for the long-term sick, the early retired and students, inactivity rates have been falling (see Chart 3.7).  The decline in inactivity rates, adjusted for those factors, is consistent with continuing labour market tightness. Labour usage, as measured by total hours worked per week, rose by 0.1% in the three months to November, and by 0.3% on a year earlier.  Employment growth has outpaced the growth in total hours worked, so average hours worked per head have fallen.  This is consistent with both a rise in part-time work and a fall in overtime. So earnings per hour may have been growing by more than earnings per head. The continued growth of employment, in the face of slowing output growth, has meant that measured productivity growth, per hour or per head, has fallen. Whole-economy measured productivity growth rose by 1.6% in the year to 1998 Q3.  Productivity growth since 1995 has averaged around 1.6%, below its long-run Sources:  ONS and Bank of England.

The labour market 29 historical average growth rate of around 2.1% (see  Chart 3.8).  It is extremely difficult to judge the future path of productivity growth.  This is because it depends partly on how quickly firms adjust their demand for labour, and on their choice of adjusting between average hours worked and the number of people employed.  If firms regard slower economic activity as transitory, then they would be unlikely to reduce employee numbers, given hiring and firing costs.  This could lower productivity growth.  It is also possible that there has been a level shift in trend productivity.  Labour market reforms may have encouraged new workers into the workforce, or created new jobs with lower-than-average productivity.  Such factors could act to reduce the level of whole-economy measured productivity.  The MPC judges that productivity growth will slow during 1999, before picking up towards the end of the forecast period. Wage pressure is also influenced by the geographic distribution of unemployment.  If there are imbalances between the distribution of unemployed workers across different regions, such regional mismatch will affect wage pressure at any given level of aggregate unemployment.  Chart 3.9 shows how one measure of regional mismatch has changed over time;  it remains low relative to the level in the 1980s.  So lower regional mismatch could be a factor contributing to the apparent weakness of upward pressure on earnings growth, despite low aggregate unemployment. Another measure of mismatch that can be used to gauge labour market tightness is the ratio of the stock of reported vacancies to total unemployment.  This ratio can be interpreted as a comparison of unsatisfied labour demand with available supply.  The extent to which the unemployed are able to fill available vacancies is likely to affect wage pressure significantly at any given level  of unemployment.  Chart 3.10 shows that the labour market is much tighter now than in 1997 on this measure, though the most recent data suggest that the ratio may be stabilising.  Two alternative measures of the relationship between vacancies and unemployment, which stress the roles of vacancy inflows and inflows into unemployment, are also shown.  They also suggest a moderation in labour market tightness. Surveys provide a forward-looking perspective of the state of the labour market, and can shed light on  near-term employment prospects.  Recent CIPS reports pointed to sharp falls in construction and manufacturing employment, and a contraction in service sector Chart 3.8 Whole-economy measured productivity  growth(a) 1980 85 90 95  1  2  3  4  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 + _ Long-run average   (1960–98) Percentage changes on a year earlier Source:  ONS.

And as Table 3.B shows, there has been a deterioration in recruitment intentions. The Manpower survey in December indicated the lowest net balance for five years.  But when seasonal adjustment is taken into account, the balance is much closer to its average level since 1988. Chart 3.12 shows evidence from the CBI suggesting that reported shortages of both skilled and unskilled labour have decreased in recent quarters, though these have risen slightly on the latest data.  Shortages in the skilled and unskilled sectors of the labour market are often cited by employers as an important factor underpinning wage pressure.  The reduction in the percentage balance of employers reporting labour shortages, from levels reported in mid 1997, is consistent with an easing of upward pressure on pay growth. 3.3 Reforms affecting the labour market Prospects for the labour market are affected by microeconomic policies that aim to influence the demand for and supply of labour.  Measures such as the New Deal and the Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC) are designed to increase labour market participation.  A box on page 31 considers the impact of the WFTC on labour market supply, and concludes that implementation of the reform is likely to result in a moderate increase in labour market participation.  The MPC judges that it is unlikely that the WFTC will significantly influence the profile of inflation over the forecast period. However, the Working Time Directive (WTD) may result in increased effective hourly wage costs for employers, a reduction in total hours worked and lower potential output.  The cost effects of the WTD, which came into effect on 1 October 1998, chiefly consist of restrictions on hours worked, direct costs from paid holiday entitlements, fixed costs of health assessments for  night-workers, and costs of administration.(1) The Bank’s regional Agents have reported that a number of contacts expect increased wage bills, due to more generous holiday entitlements.  But how far the WTD decreases employment in equilibrium will depend on how flexibly firms are able to adjust hours worked and numbers of people employed.  In the November Report, the MPC noted that risks to inflation from the WTD warranted a small positive skew in the first year of the inflation projection.

(a) Difference between those respondents answering ‘yes’ and those  answering ‘no’ when questioned on factors likely to limit output  during next four months. (1) A box on page 30 in the November 1998 Report describes the WTD in more detail.  The labour market 31 The Working Families Tax Credit The Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC) is an in-work benefit for low-income households with dependent children, and is intended to replace the existing Family Credit scheme from October 1999.(1) Like Family Credit, the WFTC will be paid  to families where at least one adult works  more than 16 hours per week.  Under the Family Credit scheme, families earning below £79 per week received a flat-rate maximum payment.  Above that level, benefits were withdrawn by 70 pence for every £1 of additional income.  Under the WFTC, the earnings threshold has been raised to £90, and the withdrawal rate for households earning above this threshold has been reduced to  55 pence in the pound.  Recipients of the  WFTC are also entitled to help with 70% of childcare costs, subject to a ceiling determined by the number of children in the household. The WFTC has the potential to increase participation in the labour market and hence the supply of labour available to meet labour demand. The WFTC is likely to have different effects  on the labour supplied by different groups of people.  For some individuals, such as lone parents, the WFTC should raise the incentives  to work, because of the increase in the threshold, the reduction of the withdrawal rate and the fall in childcare costs.  For other people, such as partners of WFTC recipients,  the incentive to work may be reduced.  This  is because the WFTC reforms could entail  an increase in family income for a partner  when they do not work, increasing their desire to move out of work.  This effect may be counteracted by the childcare credit, as both partners in a couple must be working to  receive help with childcare costs.  But since  a significant amount of childcare is informal, introduction of the WFTC may lead to  some substitution from informal to formal childcare. The impact of the WFTC on the number of hours worked is also likely to vary between groups.  When in-work benefits are withdrawn as earnings rise, the incentive to work an extra hour is reduced.  For some households, this disincentive will lessen with the WFTC, because of the raising of the earnings level at which withdrawal starts, and the lowering of the withdrawal rate.  But there will be some people who will be better off overall by receiving WFTC, but who do not currently receive Family Credit.  This group will face the additional 55% withdrawal rate of WFTC on top of the marginal withdrawal rate, produced by income tax and National Insurance, that they already faced. This may cause them to reduce labour supply. For the population as a whole, a reliable guide to the impact of the WFTC can only be provided by a simulation based on a representative sample of households.  Independent research(2) by the Institute of Fiscal Studies has attempted to quantify the labour market impact of the WFTC, using its tax and benefit simulation model (TAXBEN) and data from the Family Resources Survey.  They divide recipients into two groups—lone parents, and couples with children.  Their analysis indicates that the WFTC is likely to increase the participation of lone parents in the labour market.  Among couples, the effects on male participation are estimated to be small, while there is a moderate decrease in labour supplied by women as a result of the incentives to move out of work highlighted above.  Their provisional findings suggest that the increase in total economy-wide participation, which depends on how far the childcare subsidy is taken up, would lie between 10,000 and 45,000 workers, with a point estimate of 30,000 in the event of a 100% take-up of childcare subsidy.  In the MPC’s judgment, numbers of this magnitude are unlikely materially to affect whole-economy labour supply.  So it is unlikely that the WFTC will significantly influence the profile of inflation over the forecast period. (1) For a detailed discussion of the policy, see ‘The Modernisation of Britain’s Tax & Benefits System—the Working Families Tax Credit and Work Incentives’, Treasury Budget Paper No 3, 1998. (2) The Bank of England has contributed towards the cost of this study.  Inflation Report:  February 1999 32 MPC has now incorporated an effect from the WTD into its central projection, rather than as a risk, but it remains small. 3.4 Summary The labour market appears tight by recent historical standards.  Employment growth continues to be strong, leading to falls in both unemployment and inactivity. The LFS unemployment rate stood at 6.2% in the three months to November, slightly lower than in the preceding three months.  But recent survey evidence points to a moderation in recruitment intentions and some alleviation of skill shortages.  So a turning-point in labour market conditions may have been reached. The ONS has suspended publication of the Average Earnings Index, pending the outcome of an independent review commissioned by the Chancellor.  Inflation expectations have fallen significantly further in recent months.  This, together with the available evidence on nominal wage behaviour, notably from settlements and analysis of the components of wage drift, appears consistent with an easing of upward pressure on earnings growth over the forecast period.  33 Costs and prices 4 Chart 4.1 Bank’s commodity price index(a)  2.5  5.0  7.5 10.0 12.5 15.0 17.5   0.0   2.5   5.0   7.5  10.0  12.5 1992 93 94 95 96 97 98 + _ Oil-inclusive Non-oil Percentage changes on a year earlier Chart 4.2 Forward curves of Brent crude dollar  oil prices(a) 10.0 12.5 15.0 17.5 20.0 22.5 Oct.

World prices of commodities, which have fallen further since the November Report, have resulted in falling producer prices in the major economies.  UK import prices have continued to decline, and in December, manufacturing output prices were flat or lower than a year earlier.  Output price inflation in the service sector has been higher than in manufacturing, but evidence from the CIPS survey suggests that cost pressures may be easing there.  The limited information available, from the National Accounts and surveys, points to a moderation in nominal unit labour cost growth since the middle of 1998. 4.1 Raw materials and commodity prices World prices of raw materials and commodities have fallen sharply over the past three years.  The Economist dollar index of world non-oil commodity prices has fallen by more than 20%, and the dollar oil price has fallen by almost 40%.  The Bank’s commodity price indices, which are weighted by UK demand, have also declined sharply over the past three years—excluding oil prices, they have fallen by 18%, and including oil, by 24% (see Chart 4.1). Brent crude oil prices fell from a peak of $24 per barrel in January 1997 to a trough of just below $10 in December 1998, and remained low at $10–12 throughout January (oil prices were lower only in July 1986 and prior to that 1973).  The decline reflects the contraction of Asian demand and expectations of subdued world demand in 1999.  The forward prices for Brent crude, which were revised down throughout 1998 as spot prices fell, suggest that prices will remain broadly flat, far below their 1997 levels (see Chart 4.2).  Oil consumption per unit of output by OECD countries has fallen by around 40% since the 1970s, so the impact of lower oil prices on those countries may be less marked than in the past.  The United Kingdom is a small net exporter of oil, so lower prices may reduce income and therefore restrain demand, though net trade in oil now accounts for a much lower proportion of GDP than it did in the early or mid 1980s.  There may also be indirect effects on UK demand and prices, resulting from a shift in the (a) Monthly average of prices of primary commodities weighted by their  importance in UK demand.

The implications for UK net trade are discussed in Section 2. Non-oil commodity prices have been depressed by weaker world demand.  Wholesale food prices in the United Kingdom—which account for just under half of the Bank’s non-oil commodity price index—have been further reduced by the strength of sterling against other European currencies over the past two and a half years. The introduction of the euro has changed the way that intervention prices are calculated under the Common Agricultural Policy.  Since 1 January 1999, intervention prices have been calculated in euros and translated into sterling using the market exchange rate against the euro rather than the green pound, which has been abolished. Intervention prices were little changed in January, as sterling traded in a narrow range against the euro.  As noted in previous Reports, some intervention prices may fall from 2000, if the European Commission’s Agenda 2000 proposals are accepted. The MPC’s central projection assumes that world commodity prices in dollars will be broadly flat in 1999, before rising in 2000.  Lower oil prices are assumed to have similar effects on the UK economy to lower prices for other commodities. 4.2 Import prices and the exchange rate Sterling prices of imported goods fell by 6% in the twelve months to November, and by 13% since August 1996, when sterling began to appreciate.  The fall in import prices has been less marked than sterling’s appreciation since 1996, though the decline in sterling’s ERI and in the broad ERI since April 1998 has narrowed the gap (see Chart 4.3).  Import prices have remained high relative to the average export prices of the United Kingdom’s major trading partners, suggesting that suppliers may have used sterling’s appreciation to widen their margins on UK sales.  The response of import prices may also have been tempered if overseas exporters to the United Kingdom thought that sterling’s appreciation was temporary.  That may also have an effect on the extent and timing of the response to the recent depreciation of sterling.   As discussed in Section 2, prospects for global growth and trade have deteriorated further since the November Report, and the outlook for world inflation remains Note:  The ERI is measured against 20 other industrialised countries.  The  broad ERI is measured against 49 other countries. (a) A fall indicates an appreciation.

The MPC has revised down its projection for import prices in 1999, reflecting weaker prospects for world growth and lower world inflation. 4.3 Costs and prices in the service sector There are some signs that cost pressures in the service sector are easing.  The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) measure of the cost of all inputs fell from a peak of 58.8 in 1998 Q2 to 54 in Q4.  Although above the neutral level of 50, which indicates no change in costs compared with the previous period, that was below the average for the series, which began in  July 1996. A measure of corporate services output inflation is being developed by the ONS.  At present, it is experimental and only twelve series are published (a further 36 series will eventually be included in an aggregate index).  Of the twelve published series, seven pointed to lower inflation in 1998 Q3 than in Q2, four pointed to higher inflation, and one showed no change.  Survey data suggest that services output price inflation has eased since then.  The CIPS survey index for average prices charged fell from 52.2 in 1998 Q1 to 47.8 in Q4;  as that is below the neutral level of 50, it would be consistent with a fall in prices between the third and fourth quarters.  And the index remained below 50 in January.  But the BCC survey pointed to higher service sector inflation in 1998 Q4 than in Q3, because of the cost of overheads and pay settlements. 4.4 Costs and prices in manufacturing Input prices continued to fall throughout the second half of 1998, and were 9.3% lower than a year earlier in  1998 Q4;  excluding food, drink, tobacco and petroleum, prices were around 5% lower.  Output prices have held up relative to input prices (see Chart 4.4).  That probably reflects past increases in the cost of labour or bought-in services, which together account for around half of manufacturers’ total costs.  But in 1998 Q4, all measures of output prices were flat or lower than a year earlier.(1) Both the BCC and CBI survey measures pointed to a further decline in UK output prices.  The latest available data for 1998 for other G7 countries and the euro area as a whole also show producer prices falling (see Chart 4.5), which suggests further downward pressure on UK import (a) Output prices excluding excise duties (PPIY). (1) The ONS is to improve the Producer Price Index by changing the sample and raising the representation of small firms in the index.  Significant changes are not expected until February 2001.

Inflation Report:  February 1999 36 prices as recent reductions in global producer prices are passed on. 4.5 Retail prices Annual inflation in retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments (RPIX) was close to target at 2.6% in December, following four months when inflation had been exactly at the target rate of 2.5%.  RPIY, which also excludes indirect and local authorities’ taxes, rose to 2.0%.  The headline RPI inflation rate fell to 2.8% (see Chart 4.6).   The small increase in RPIX inflation in December was the result of a sharp rise in seasonal food prices, caused by bad weather, and a bigger increase in household goods prices than the previous December—prices often rise in this sector in advance of discounting for the January ‘sales’.  Neither of these upward influences on inflation is expected to persist. The average RPIX inflation rate was 2.6% in 1998, and it has been between 2% and 3% in every year since 1993.  The November Report noted that RPIX inflation has been very stable recently.  It is also useful to look at the distribution of inflation rates within RPIX, to see whether stable inflation rates have been accompanied by smaller relative price changes.  Chart 4.7 shows the distribution of weighted twelve-month price changes in the 77 categories of goods and services included in RPIX inflation.  As well as moving down with lower inflation since the late 1980s, the distribution of prices has also narrowed slightly, which means that the variance of relative price movements has been a little lower.  Price cuts have become more common:  in 1998, 20% of prices in RPIX were lower than a year earlier, compared with around 6% in 1988–92.  This is particularly true for goods prices—27% fell in 1998, compared with 14% of services prices. Services price inflation has been above that of goods since December 1996.  The gap between RPIX services and goods price inflation narrowed a little in December; services price inflation remained at 3.5%, whereas that for goods rose to 1.4%.  But the gap between services and goods price inflation was even wider when measured by RPIY, as petrol prices excluding excise duties were lower than a year earlier. The current size of the gap is partly due to goods prices having a higher import content than services, so an Chart 4.6 Inflation(a) 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 1995 96 97 98 Percentage changes on a year earlier RPI RPIY RPIX RPIX = Retail price index excluding mortgage interest payments.

Costs and prices 37 exchange rate appreciation lowers goods prices relative to services.  But that difference should diminish once an exchange rate appreciation ends or reverses.  However, since 1977 there have only been short periods when UK services price inflation has not exceeded that of goods, and the empirical evidence is similar for other countries. That is likely to be the result of lower productivity growth in the service sector than for goods, though it is difficult to measure the quality, and therefore productivity growth, of services precisely.(1)  The lower import content of services than goods means that the inflation rate of services has been closer to domestically generated inflation (DGI) than that of goods in the past two years.  DGI inflation measures have fallen back in recent quarters (see Chart 4.8).  One measure of DGI, the GDP deflator excluding export price inflation, fell to 2.8% in Q3.  A second measure, RPIX inflation excluding import prices, fell below 5% for the first time since 1997.  A third measure, an estimate of unit labour cost growth, is derived from data based on the AEI, which has been suspended (see Section 3).  Unit labour cost estimates are therefore less firmly based than usual. Upward revisions to employment, and small revisions to wages and salaries, mean that labour costs per unit of output appear to have been higher in 1997 than previously thought.  But recent estimates suggest that wage pressures eased in 1998 Q3:  annual unit wage cost growth fell from 3.5% in Q2 to 2.8% in Q3. Since 1997, headline RPI inflation has been above RPIX inflation, because of the interest rate rises between  May 1997 and June 1998 (see Chart 4.9).  Between October 1998 and February 1999, the MPC reduced the official repo rate by 2%.  Headline RPI inflation should, therefore, fall below RPIX inflation in the next few months as the reduction in official interest rates feeds through to lower mortgage rates, and as the April 1998 reduction in Mortgage Interest Relief at Source (MIRAS), falls out of the annual comparison.  4.6 Other price indices Other measures of retail price inflation remained flat or fell slightly during 1998 Q4.  Inflation in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) rose by 1.5% in the twelve months to December, somewhat higher than the averages for the euro area and the European Union as a Chart 4.8 Measures of domestically generated  inflation(a) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 1993 94 95 96 97 98 RPIX excluding import prices GDP deflator excluding   export prices (b)  Percentage changes on a year earlier (a) Unit labour costs measure suspended on account of Average Earnings Index.

The GDP deflator measure of whole-economy inflation fell to 1.8% in 1998 Q3. The ONS has recently constructed HICP inflation rates for the United Kingdom over a long period.(1) HICP inflation rates back to 1989 were calculated using individual price quotes (see Chart 4.10).  HICP inflation was above that of RPIX for the twelve months from April 1991.  This was a result of a cut in local authorities’ taxes, partly financed by an increase in VAT—local authorities’ taxes are included in RPIX but are excluded from the HICP, whereas VAT is included in both indices.  But on average, HICP inflation has been 0.5 percentage points lower than RPIX inflation since 1989.  HICP inflation rates were estimated for 1975–88 assuming that the use of the geometric mean (see below) has a downward effect on the inflation rate of  0.25 percentage points.  Between 1976 and 1988, HICP inflation was on average 0.5 percentage points lower than RPIX inflation. The gap between RPIX and HICP inflation is accounted for by differences in coverage and the use of different methods of combining price quotes at the lowest level. Using the geometric (instead of the arithmetic) mean in the HICP results in a lower inflation rate than the methods used in RPIX.  That is because when relative prices change, the geometric mean method in effect increases the weight on goods whose relative price has fallen (it is as though consumers are assumed to switch spending towards cheaper substitutes), whereas the arithmetic mean method has fixed weights.  This has accounted for 0.2–0.5 percentage points of the difference between the two inflation rates since 1989 (see Table 4.A).  Coverage differences have had varying effects across years.  HICP inflation is currently  1.1 percentage points below RPIX inflation.  The 0.6 percentage points of the current difference that is not explained by the use of the geometric mean reflects the exclusion from the HICP of local authorities’ taxes and owner-occupiers’ housing costs (housing depreciation is included in RPIX). 4.7 Summary Inflation was exactly on target between August and November 1998, and remained close to target in December.

HICP price indices are still under development.  From December 1999, the coverage of goods and services included in the HICP will be extended, and the population coverage will be expanded to include foreign nationals’ spending in the United Kingdom.  Costs and prices 39 been reflected in subdued manufacturing output prices. Surveys and falling producer prices overseas suggest that this weakness is set to continue.  Service sector output price inflation also appears to have moderated during the second half of 1998.   Domestically generated inflation has been significantly higher than imported inflation in the past two years. Similarly, services price inflation has been higher than that for goods.  Over the forecast period, weaker domestic demand and the lagged effects of sterling’s recent and expected depreciation should gradually narrow the gap between domestically generated and imported inflation.  The MPC’s central projection assumes that import prices rise more slowly throughout 1999 than was expected at the time of the November Report.  40 5 Monetary policy since the November Report This section summarises the economic developments and monetary policy decisions taken by the MPC since the November Report.  The minutes of the November, December and January meetings are attached as an Annex to this Report.  The Bank of England’s official dealing rate—the repo rate—was reduced from 6.75% in November to 6.25% in December, 6.0% in January, and 5.5% in February. At the time of the November Report, the central projection was for RPIX inflation to rise slightly above target over the following twelve months, before returning to around 2.5% at the two-year forecast horizon.  The small rise in projected inflation reflected higher earnings growth, including the effects of the National Minimum Wage.  Risks to the inflation outlook were thought to be symmetric—downside risks from weaker growth were expected to be balanced by upside risks from past strong money growth and from the possibility of a more rapid fall in the exchange rate. At its meeting on 9–10 December, the Committee noted that the prospects for global activity and prices had deteriorated further over the month.  Business confidence in the major economies had weakened and commodity prices, particularly oil, had fallen further. Trade data had suggested that the effects of slower world demand were now emerging, in addition to the impact of sterling’s appreciation.  There had been an easing of monetary policy in the United States and the euro area. The main domestic news concerned consumption, though other indicators of domestic activity were also showing signs of softening.  In particular, pressures in the labour market appeared to have eased.  However, aggregate M4 growth had continued at annual rates of more than 9%, and asset prices remained firm. Many of the Committee’s concerns related to the prospects for consumption and confidence. Consumption growth in Q3 had been below the November central projection, and retail sales growth pointed to further weakening in Q4.  Various reasons for the slower-than-expected household spending were suggested, and are detailed in the Annex.  These included the possibility that the consumption effects of  Monetary policy since the November Report 41 windfall payouts in 1997 had been more bunched than expected;  that consumers were more worried by the outlook for employment and were saving more;  and that consumers had not reacted to increases in wealth in the same way as in the past.  But the Committee judged that none of the explanations on its own was sufficient to explain the slowdown in consumption. In assessing the inflation outlook, the Committee noted that the mean of the two year ahead RPIX projection had already been below 2.5% in November.  The weaker global and domestic situations suggested that the balance of risks to UK activity was now even further on the downside, so the expected inflation rate two years ahead had fallen since the November Report.   The Committee therefore agreed that there was a clear case for a further cut in interest rates during the month. It considered whether it was helpful to judge the appropriate level of nominal interest rates by reference to a ‘neutral’ level that provided neither restraint nor stimulus to the economy.  Proxies for the neutral interest rate could, in principle, be determined by combining short-term inflation expectations with an estimate of the short-run real interest rate.  But in practice, measurement of the neutral nominal rate was difficult and imprecise; estimates lay between 4.5% and 6.5%.  Though some Committee members found the concept useful, others judged that the uncertainty surrounding its level was too large for it to be a practical guide to policy.  The widely held view was that an immediate cut in interest rates of 50 basis points was justified by the news over the month. Accordingly, the Committee voted to reduce the repo rate from 6.75% to 6.25%. At its meeting on 6–7 January, the Committee again considered the prospects for global activity and prices. Views varied on whether there had been a further deterioration in external demand over the month, or whether international developments had principally reflected the continuing pass-through and unwinding of previous negative shocks.  However, commodity prices had remained weak—the fall in world oil prices to around $10 per barrel prior to the December meeting had largely persisted, and non-oil commodity prices had increased only slightly in November.  Overall, the Committee felt that the prospects for global activity and prices had changed little since December, and that the risks to both inflation and activity remained clearly on the downside.  Inflation Report:  February 1999 42 The main domestic news on activity had been the small downward revision to the level of GDP and the change in the composition of growth.  Consumption had been revised down, and the contribution from net trade and inventory accumulation had been revised up.  The lower estimate for the level of GDP suggested that pressure on capacity was likely to have been less than previously thought.  The news from retail sales had been mixed, while monetary growth and world stock markets pointed to a stronger outlook for activity.  The Committee concluded that recent indicators suggested that GDP growth in 1998 Q4 would turn out broadly as expected at the time of the November Report. Given this picture for activity, nominal price and cost developments continued to be more benign than expected at the time of the November projections and, on the view of some Committee members, than expected in December.  Producer input prices had continued to fall, and wage settlements had been flat for many months.  Depending on wage drift developments, this suggested a somewhat lower path for earnings growth than previously expected. In its discussion of the immediate policy decision, the Committee largely focused on two considerations.  First, the adjustment in the world economy was likely to prove more prolonged than previously assumed, so there was less need for policy to put downward pressure on domestically generated inflation.  Second, revisions to the expenditure composition of domestic demand, together with the potential easing in the labour market and the apparent moderation of inflation expectations, suggested weaker prospects for inflation.  Against this background, the Committee voted to cut the Bank’s repo rate by 0.25% to 6.0%. At its meeting on 3–4 February, the Committee voted to reduce the repo rate by 0.5% to 5.5%.  43 Prospects for inflation 6 6.1 The inflation projection assumptions This Report, which the MPC approved on 5 February, contains the Committee’s assessment of developments in inflation in the economy since November, and prospects for the medium term.  Charts 6.1 and 6.2 show projections for GDP growth and RPIX inflation up to two years ahead, and the uncertainties surrounding them. The projections assume that the Bank’s repo interest rate will remain unchanged at 5.5% during the next two years, and are conditioned on the assumptions described below. There has been a further downturn in the prospects for world demand and inflation since the November Report. The outlook for Japan appears even weaker than three months ago, and prospects for growth in the euro area have deteriorated.  This has to some extent been offset by stronger demand in the United States.  Outside the major industrial economies, prospects for some emerging market economies look weaker, particularly following the floating of the Brazilian real.  The Committee now assumes that UK-weighted export markets will grow by 4%–5% in both 1999 and 2000, well below the average over the 1990s.  As in recent projections, the slowdown in the growth rate of  UK-weighted export markets is likely to be less severe than the slowdown in total world trade, because of the compression of intra-Asian trade.  But the UK share of its export markets is likely to continue to fall during the next two years, because of the lagged effects of the past appreciation of sterling. Moreover, although the MPC considers the risks to output to be broadly balanced in the first year of the projection, there is a downside risk to UK demand from lower world growth in the second year of the projection. In particular, the slowdown in activity in industrial countries could prove protracted and hence lead to weaker UK net trade.  One particular risk is that US domestic demand growth, having been very strong, will slow more sharply than assumed in the central case, perhaps following a fall in stock-market values. The weaker outlook for world activity has also led to the prospect of a softer profile for world inflation in the  Inflation Report:  February 1999 44 short run, and hence for lower imported inflation, than expected at the time of the November Inflation Report. In particular, commodity prices remain low.  Given the exchange rate assumptions outlined below, the central projection is for the fall in import prices in sterling terms to end.  There is a risk that world export prices could be weaker than in the central projection, which would lead to lower UK inflation. The sterling exchange rate, as measured by the effective exchange rate index, averaged 100.1 in the 15 working days up to and including 3 February.  This is the  starting-point for the exchange rate profile assumed in the projection.  It compares with an average of 100.0 at the time of the November Report and an implied level of 99.7 for February then.  So the starting-point for the exchange rate now is a little higher than in the November projection. In judging the path for sterling, conditional on unchanged UK nominal interest rates, the MPC has taken into account both interest rate differentials and risk considerations.  In the central projection, the sterling ERI declines to 97.6 by the end of the two-year forecast period, and this implies bilateral sterling exchange rates of about $1.67 and  0.72 (equivalent to DM 2.71).  By itself, the introduction of the euro has no direct implications for UK monetary policy, at least in the near term.  In the MPC’s view, there is still a somewhat greater risk of a fall in the sterling ERI than a rise, relative to the central projection.  On average, the sterling ERI is expected to decline more steeply than in the central projection, reaching a level just above 96 in two years’ time.  The November Inflation Report projections allowed for  a small risk of a marked reduction in the supply of  credit to UK companies and households, following the global financial turbulence earlier in the year.  That  risk did not materialise, and the MPC has decided to remove this small downside risk to demand and  inflation. The plans announced in the autumn pre-Budget statement made by the Chancellor on 3 November were incorporated into the November projections, and these figures remain the basis for the February projections. Given the Government’s announced plans and the Committee’s latest central projection for inflation, the likely profiles for real government consumption and investment are similar to those assumed by the Committee in November.    Prospects for inflation 45 Previous projections have already incorporated assumptions about the effects of the National Minimum Wage, the New Deal and the Working Time Directive (WTD).  There was a small upside risk to inflation from the introduction of the WTD in the November projection.  Further analysis has not altered the MPC’s view that the effects of the WTD on inflation and output are likely to be relatively small, but the Committee decided to allow for an effect in the central projection. Preliminary results of independent research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies on the impact of the Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC) have also been made available to the Committee (see page 31).  The Committee judges that the reduction in inflation up to the forecast horizon following the introduction of the WFTC is likely to be very small, and decided not to make any allowance in its projections.  There is no change to the assumptions made in recent Reports on the effects of other labour market reform measures. 6.2 The medium-term inflation projection The preliminary estimate of output growth in the fourth quarter of 1998 released in January was close to the central projection made in the November Report, and hence by itself contained little news.  However, the previous month’s National Accounts release of data for Q3 had contained some revisions to the level of output, and to the composition of demand growth in recent quarters.  The level of output was around 0.2% lower than previously thought, but this revision was not large enough to warrant a significant change of view on the extent of inflationary pressures in the economy.  Final domestic demand growth (ie excluding inventory accumulation) was a little lower than expected at the time of the November Report, largely because of weaker consumption growth.   The Committee discussed various possible explanations for lower-than-expected consumption growth in Q3 and in preceding quarters that had been revised, and concluded that none was compelling on its own.  One possibility was that consumption had recently been erratically low, and would at some stage recover to its equilibrium level in relation to labour income, wealth and interest rates.  There was also a chance that the data would be revised.  Other possibilities were that the windfall effect from demutualisations or the wealth effect from rising equity prices had been smaller than assumed in previous projections.  The Committee decided not to treat all of the weaker outturn for  Inflation Report:  February 1999 46 consumption as erratic, and so the central projection is for a slightly lower level of consumption in relation to income through the forecast period than assumed three months ago. Investment in Q3 was a little stronger than expected at the time of the November Report, and was also revised upwards in earlier quarters.  But investment intentions in manufacturing remain very subdued, and have also weakened in the service sector.  The Committee reduced its central projections for investment growth markedly at the time of the August 1998 Report, partly on account of the survey evidence, and it judges that no further adjustment is warranted.  The central projection remains that the growth rate of business investment is likely to slow sharply this year and may well turn negative. The contribution to GDP growth in the third quarter from the change in inventories was stronger than expected at the time of the previous Report, but revisions to earlier quarters lowered the measured stock-output ratio.  It remains likely that a reduction in inventories will significantly detract from GDP growth in the period ahead.   The central projection is that net exports are likely to depress GDP growth in both 1999 and 2000.  However, the weaker outlook for world demand and UK exports is largely offset by weaker UK domestic demand and imports, so the deterioration in net trade is little changed relative to the November Report projections. Although the outturn for Q4 GDP was in line with the November central projection, the MPC judges that the prospects for activity in the period immediately ahead have deteriorated somewhat.  There are two main reasons:  first, a downward revision to the projection for domestic demand, particularly consumption, linked to the outlook for the labour market discussed below;  and second, a further deterioration in the prospects for world demand and UK exports.   The central projection is for the four-quarter growth rate of GDP at constant market prices to slow to between 1/2% and 1% during this year, before recovering to around trend by the middle of 2000 as domestic demand picks up (see Chart 6.1).(1) The trough in the central projection for growth is a little deeper than at the time of the November Report.  Quarterly growth is expected to be close to zero in the first half of this year.  The central (1) Also shown as Chart 1 in the Overview.

These surveys, although much weaker than their past historical averages, also point to broadly flat GDP at the start of 1999. As well as some deterioration in the immediate prospects for output, there has also been news over the past three months about nominal variables.  Broad money growth has slowed, consistent with a gradual slowing of demand.  Inflation expectations have fallen on a number of measures over the past quarter.  This is likely to lead to lower wage and price-setting.  In addition, the reduction in interest rates in recent months means that headline RPI inflation is likely to fall below RPIX inflation for a period, which may further moderate pressure on pay settlements. The suspension of the Average Earnings Index last November, pending the outcome of the independent review, makes analysis of the labour market more than usually uncertain, and this is reflected in the greater width of the inflation projection fan chart than would otherwise be the case.  Given the further tightening of the labour market in the past year, settlements might have been expected to rise over the past few months.  In fact, settlements were flat on the twelve-month employment-weighted measure for the past nine months. It also seems probable that wage drift is now contributing less to the growth of earnings per head than it has been, especially given the recent fall in average hours worked per employee and hence the likely reduction in overtime pay.  The recent survey by the Bank’s regional Agents for the February MPC showed more companies expecting lower settlements this year than higher, though the same survey showed a less clear picture for growth in earnings per head.  Although the recent public sector pay settlements were higher than a year ago, and both the Working Time Directive and the National Minimum Wage are likely to increase labour costs to some degree, upward pressure on overall pay growth appears to be easing.  This has led the Committee to lower both the starting-point and central projection for nominal earnings growth compared with the November Report. LFS unemployment has declined slightly over the past three months, claimant-count unemployment is at its lowest level since 1980, and employment has continued to rise.  Overall, the data suggest that the labour market has reached a turning-point.  The Committee’s central  Inflation Report:  February 1999 48 projection is that employment may fall for a time, reflecting a period of output growth below trend.  This will ease pressures on pay.  The LFS measure of inactivity has been rising, but this reflects a long-term structural increase due to such factors as the rise in the number of long-term sick.  After adjusting for these, the inactivity rate is likely to be cyclical and to rise a little as the economy slows.  This matters for the projection because the inactive are assumed to exert much less downward pressure on the level of real earnings than the unemployed. Over the past three years, as employment has grown strongly, measured productivity growth has been 11/2%, somewhat below trend.  Whole-economy productivity growth is judged likely to remain below its long-run average in 1999, before increasing towards the end of the forecast period.  There are several possible explanations for weaker-than-average productivity growth over the recent past.  First, productivity may have been mismeasured.  Second, the strength of employment growth as activity slowed has been surprising.  This may reflect a timing effect as firms expect the slowdown in demand to be temporary, in which case measured productivity may eventually return to its long-run trend level.  A third possibility is that the rate of increase in productivity has been temporarily weaker than its average historical rate because of structural changes in the labour market.  For example, it is possible that labour market reforms have encouraged new workers into the labour market, or created new jobs, with lower-than-average productivity, which reduced the measured level of productivity growth while the adjustment was taking place.  Thereafter, productivity growth would be expected to return to its long-run average.  These alternative possibilities have different implications for price-cost margins.  A rapid rise in employment consistent with firms assuming that weakening demand was temporary would suggest that productive capacity is greater than previously thought, and hence put downward pressure on margins.  But a shift in the level of average productivity would imply lower capacity and less downward pressure on margins. The central projection attaches some weight to all of these explanations, and taken together they raise the projection for inflation compared with the productivity assumption in the November Report.  But there is a great deal of uncertainty, and on balance there is a small downside risk to inflation from these factors relative to the central projection.  The sensitivities are such that if one took the view that there had not been any shift in   Prospects for inflation 49 the level of average productivity, then the central projection for inflation would be about 0.2 percentage points lower. Survey measures of capacity utilisation from the BCC and CBI are broadly consistent with estimates based on an examination of output relative to inputs of capital and labour.  A fall in capacity utilisation was already under way at the end of 1998, which does not seem surprising given the slowing of output growth compared with its trend.  The prospective fall from peak to trough is likely to be much smaller than in the early 1990s.  This partly reflects the starting-point:  capacity utilisation measures were much higher in the late 1980s than in the late 1990s.  The effect of capacity utilisation on prices (relative to weighted costs) seems to be pro-cyclical. But prices respond to capacity utilisation with a lag, so the central projection is that the reduction in utilisation rates will continue to put downward pressure on inflation as growth picks up. The MPC’s projection for the twelve-month RPIX inflation rate—assuming that nominal interest rates are constant at 5.5%—is shown in Chart 6.2.(1) The November projection, which corresponds to a 1.25% higher interest rate assumption, is shown alongside it (Chart 6.3).  The most likely path is for RPIX inflation to stay close to the 21/2% target for the next two years. The profile for inflation through this year is a little lower than in the November projection for 1999, but is broadly the same as in November by the end of the forecast period.  This reflects a number of factors.  The downturn in prospects for world activity implies a weaker outlook for both UK exports and world prices, and so lower UK inflation.  And the starting-point and profile for the sterling effective exchange rate is a little higher than in November.  There is the also a prospect of slower growth of consumption and hence domestic demand. The starting-point and profile for earnings growth are lower in the current projection.  But some factors have raised the central projection since November.  Interest rates were reduced by 0.5% in December, 0.25% in January and 0.5% in February. The balance of risks to output is on the downside throughout the forecast period, as at the time of the November Report.  Overall, the risks to inflation are broadly balanced in the first year of the projection, but are slightly on the downside through the second year of (1) Also shown as Chart 2 in the Overview.

Table 6.A shows the MPC’s assessment of the probabilities of various outturns for inflation and output growth. The market expectation of the likely path of interest rates has fallen since the November Report.  On  3 February, implied interest rates on short-sterling contracts suggested that the market expectation was for a fall in official interest rates to around 5% by the end of 1999.  The MPC’s projections for inflation and output growth under the assumption that official interest rates follow market expectations differ somewhat from those in the central projection (see Charts 6.6 and 6.7).  The path of interest rates is below the constant interest rate assumption, implying slightly faster growth and consequently higher inflation than in the central projection which, at the two-year horizon, is above the target.

These uncertainties are illustrated explicitly in the Inflation Report fan charts for growth and RPIX inflation.  But how should the Inflation Report fan charts be interpreted? The fan chart probability distributions contain more information than a simple point forecast.  The width of the fans measures the overall degree of uncertainty, which may change from quarter to quarter as the assessment of risks evolves.  How far the bands stretch out on one side of the central band compared with the other—the skew of the distribution—is determined by an assessment of the balance of risks.  Again, this can change from quarter to quarter. Fan charts are shaded rather like a contour map in the following sense.  Pick a particular date in the forecast period.  The fan chart at that point shows the MPC’s judgment of the probability of various ranges of outcomes.  As with a contour map, it represents a simplified version of a cross-section of a hill.  Figure 1 illustrates a ‘probability hill’. The probability of any specific inflation number occurring is close to zero, so it is better to think of the probability that inflation will fall within a particular range.  That is what the fan chart illustrates.  The width of the band shows a range.  The central band (around the peak in Figure 1) defines the range within which there is a 10% chance of inflation occurring. This area is shaded deep red.  Each successive pair of lighter-shaded red bands is drawn in a similar way by adding another 10% of the probability and moving further down the probability hill.  Taken together, the shaded areas contains 90% of the probability distribution. The same method is used for each point in time over the forecast period.  The fan chart is drawn by joining up the individual probability distributions through time.  As with a contour map, the darkest band corresponds to the highest part of the probability hill. It is the narrowest range of outcomes for inflation that contains 10% of the probability.  In other words, the likely outcomes are clustered round the central point. Uncertainty increases as the forecast period moves forward, so the width of the bands increases. Some of the risks that the MPC discusses when making the Inflation Report projection will materialise, and others will not.  So the economy is unlikely to move along the band containing the central projection throughout the forecast period, or any other particular shaded band in the fan chart.  It is, for example, quite possible that inflation will be above the central projection in the first year, but will fall below the central projection in the second year (or vice versa).   There are numerous different possible paths for the economy, and the fan chart tries to capture these outcomes in a single chart.  Taking an average of all these possibilities gives the mean of the distribution. If the distribution of outcomes is symmetric, then the modal (ie most likely) outcome will equal the mean outcome, and both will lie exactly at the centre of the darkest band.  But this will not be the case if the risks are asymmetric.  If the risks to inflation are more on one side of the central case than the other, then the distribution will be skewed, with the average (mean) outcome above or below the most likely (modal) outcome.  If the distribution is sufficiently skewed, the mean will lie outside the central band.   The median outturn defines the point in the distribution at which there is an even chance of higher or lower inflation.  In a skewed distribution, the median will lie between the mean and mode. There are many alternative ways of illustrating pictorially the same underlying probability distribution.  But different methods of illustration do not alter what is being illustrated.  Policy is unaffected by how a fan chart is drawn.

Prospects for inflation 53 6.3 Other forecasts Section 3 described the fall in survey measures of inflation expectations for the next one to two years.  That fall is mirrored in the information gathered from 29 forecasters surveyed by the Bank.  The median forecast for the year to 1999 Q4 was 2.1% in January, rising slightly to 2.3% for 2000 Q4, and reaching 2.5% in  2001 Q1.  The estimates for 1999 and 2000 are a little lower than the projections made at the time of the October survey.  Chart 6.8 shows the distribution of central forecasts for the twelve-month rate of RPIX inflation in 2001 Q1. The forecasters surveyed by the Bank also provided their assessments of the probabilities that they attach to various outcomes for inflation and growth (see  Table 6.B).  They assign just over 40% probability to inflation being above the target in the first quarter of 2001, and just under 60% probability to it being below. These estimates are broadly the same as at the time of the October survey.  The average projection for GDP growth in the year to 1999 Q4 is 3/4% (with a range of projections from -3/4% to 13/4%), rising to 21/2% in the year to 2001 Q1 (with a range of 3/4% to 31/2%).  The estimate for 1999 Q4 is similar to that at the time of the November Report.  Overall, the forecasters assign a 20% probability to output growth falling below zero in the year to 1999 Q4, compared with 21% at the time of the October survey. The implications of the latest projections for the stance of monetary policy are discussed in the Overview at the beginning of the Report.

Prior to the meeting, the Committee was briefed by Treasury officials on the Chancellor’s latest projections for economic activity and the public finances. Survey evidence, domestic demand, activity 2 The evidence of a sharp slowdown in domestic output growth was strongest in the surveys and in reports from the Bank’s regional Agencies.  Both business and consumer confidence had continued to deteriorate during October.  Survey indicators of export orders had been very weak for some time, but the domestic activity indicators had fallen sharply in the latest month, and this had extended to services as well as manufacturing;  the CIPS measure of incoming new business, for example, was below 50, although business expectations remained quite buoyant.  There had not been such an abrupt change in sentiment in manufacturing—as measured by the CBI Industrial Trends Survey of business optimism—since the early 1980s.  It was, however, difficult to make comparisons with the past as there were now many more surveys, mostly with relatively short histories. 3 The Bank’s regional Agents had for some time been indicating that the economy was slowing, but their reports over the past two months indicated a sharper slowdown.  The Committee noted that the Agents had identified evidence of the downturn in the early 1990s before it had become apparent in the official data. 4 This latest evidence suggested that the slowdown was more marked than predicted in the Committee’s August central projection, although measured GDP growth in Q3 was slightly stronger than expected.  In judging how much weight to place on survey data, the Committee discussed possible causes and its consistency with recent data on demand and activity. 5 One source of accumulating stress had been the substantial appreciation in the real exchange rate from mid-1996.  This had not immediately hit confidence, in marked contrast to some earlier episodes when sterling had risen sharply, for example in the 1970s and early 1980s.  And its impact on net trade had in fact taken much longer to emerge than the Bank had originally expected. There were various possible explanations for this, each of which probably had some validity.  Some firms had initially had in place financial market hedges against currency movements, but anecdotal evidence suggested probably not much beyond a year.  Similarly some firms would have enjoyed a degree of stability until contracts with overseas trading partners matured and were renegotiated. There might also have been a delayed effect where plans and major investment and expansion projects were reviewed at infrequent intervals.  And, more generally, businesses had had to judge how persistent sterling’s appreciation would be.  As discussed at previous meetings and in earlier Inflation Reports, these and other factors might have contributed to long lags in the impact of sterling’s appreciation on export volumes.  As the effects became evident, the implications for the economy generally of a slowdown in the trade of externally exposed businesses might have become more apparent to firms in relatively more sheltered sectors and to consumers.  For example, just as a buoyant services sector and strong domestic demand growth had probably helped to sustain growth in manufacturing for a while, so services would not be insulated from a manufacturing slowdown. 6 In the absence of other factors, the slowdown brought about by sterling’s appreciation and the tightening of monetary and fiscal policy could plausibly have been associated with a gradual decline in domestic sentiment rather than the sharp fall indicated by surveys.  But the world economic outlook had been affected over the summer by a series of adverse shocks, which would further reduce external demand for UK exports and sharpen price competition from imports.  Confidence in the financial services industry had been hit;  optimism in the financial sector, as measured by the CBI Financial Services Survey, was lower in 1998 Q3 than for eight years.  Well publicised job cuts in a range of sectors, whether or not directly affected by general economic conditions, had probably increased awareness of the changing outlook. 7 The preliminary official estimate suggested that Q3 GDP growth was unchanged at 0.5%, still close to trend.  But the latest industrial production numbers showed that output had recently been falling;  in particular, manufacturing output fell by 1.1% between July and September, with falls in most parts of the production industries.  These numbers were more consistent with what recent surveys had been indicating, and gave grounds for thinking that the Q3 GDP number might be revised down.  Separately there were signs in recent surveys—for example in the monthly CBI Industrial Trends Survey and the CBI Distributive Trades Survey—that recent output growth might have been associated with greater than planned stockbuilding, with production not yet fully adjusted to weakening demand. 8 On the expenditure side, the Committee noted that the latest data showed falling retail sales growth, and lower turnover in the housing market compared with a year ago.  Despite the recent sharp rebound, the equity market was 15% lower than its peak in July, which would tend to reduce consumption growth via its effect on households wealth, and reduce investment demand via a higher cost of capital. 9 There were, therefore, signs in the data that a slowdown, as indicated by surveys, was occurring.  The direction of change was clear.  But it was quite possible that the surveys were painting too bleak a picture.  For example, the equity market had not fallen to a level that would reduce consumption to the extent suggested by surveys.  And the surveys had historically been more volatile than recorded output and so could mislead.  Moreover, the tone of some public comment had moved from predicting a slowdown through a downturn, to a recession and even a slump.  That was extreme, and might be contributing to deteriorating confidence.  It could, therefore, have some effect on spending. 10 In the light of all these considerations, the Committee judged that the forward-looking evidence from surveys and the Bank’s regional Agents should be given increased weight in assessing the outlook for activity and inflation.  The Committee thought that the economy should, however, be better placed to face adverse shocks than in the early 1990s, in large part because both corporate and personal sector balance sheets (especially in the housing market) and liquidity were stronger now than then, and inflation had already reached the target.  Moreover, monetary growth remained robust. The most likely outcome was for continuing positive output growth in 1999, though at a lower rate than expected in August, and the downside risks had increased. Implications of the world economic environment 11 The international environment remained fragile.  There was still considerable uncertainty about the prospects for recovery in the Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 4–5 November 1998  Inflation Report:  February 1999 58 Japanese economy.  The recession there was deeper than had been assumed in the Committee’s August forecast.  Most forecasters had revised down their projections for continental European growth. According to the initial estimate, Q3 growth in the United States had been stronger than expected, although some of that strength might be the result of involuntary inventory accumulation.  US broad monetary growth remained quite strong.  The risks of further contagion and shocks to emerging market economies seemed to have reduced somewhat over the past month, and the extreme uncertainty in some markets had lessened, perhaps helped most recently by the G7 statement. 12 An important element of the Committee’s analysis was the deteriorating outlook for world trade given the poor prospects in Japan and some emerging market economies.  Between 1980 and 1993 world trade had grown at an average annual rate of 4%.  This had risen to around 9% in 1994–97, but was projected by the international organisations to fall to 4%–6% over 1998–2000.  Part of the expected fall was attributable to (perhaps temporarily) reduced intra-Asian trade, which had accounted for much of the earlier increase.  The Committee thought that the near term growth rate of the UK’s export markets should fall by less than overall world trade.  But on the other hand the strength of sterling, although less pronounced than in August, was likely to mean that UK exports would grow less quickly than UK export markets over the forecast period.  The Committee agreed that it was most likely that net trade would contribute negatively to output growth over the next two years. 13 The weakening in the external environment had also had a material effect on world prices.  Commodity prices were still falling, as were input prices more generally.  Looking forward, the expected rate of world price inflation had fallen compared with a quarter ago, reducing expected imported inflation and thus the outlook for RPIX.  This was an important factor in the Committee’s inflation projection.  In addition, domestic output price inflation was at its lowest level since 1975.  Both CBI and BCC surveys indicated further falls. The labour market 14 The Committee discussed a range of labour market indicators.  LFS employment had risen quite strongly in the three months to August, as had total hours worked.  On the other hand, LFS unemployment had increased slightly.  The number of economically inactive people had fallen.  Overall the latest quantity data suggested that conditions were still tight but might no longer be tightening. 15 Earnings growth was a key indicator of domestically generated inflation.  While labour market pressures should abate and earnings growth ease as the economy slowed, the implications for inflation would also depend on the current rate of earnings growth.  There was greater than normal uncertainty about this, given the problems with the AEI.  The Committee agreed to reflect this in its forecast variance. Monetary and credit conditions 16 The future path of interest rates expected by the market was lower than a month ago, and much lower than at the time of the August Inflation Report.  Taken together with the Committee’s  25 basis point cut at its October meeting, this had delivered some easing in monetary conditions. 17 Sterling had fallen 41/4% from the 15-day average used in the projections published in the August Inflation Report.  This would tend to reduce the restraining effect on inflation from sterling’s earlier appreciation.  The Committee judged that the balance of risks was still in the direction of sterling falling by more than assumed in its central projection, although the downside risk was not as large as in August. 18 The Committee noted that broad money and credit growth remained robust.  High broad money growth remained an upside risk to the inflation outlook.  Unsecured lending to the personal sector continued to grow rapidly, although the macroeconomic consequences were possibly not great as it accounted for only around 20% of the stock of lending to the personal sector. 19 Of more immediate interest was whether there were signs of a material tightening in credit conditions.  The spread of corporate bond yields over government bond yields had increased significantly since the Russian and Long-Term Capital Management crises, corporate issuance was lower than usual, and actual and implied volatility were higher in a number of markets. But, perhaps in contrast to the United States, there was no evidence that the credit process had been significantly interrupted in the United Kingdom.  Corporate bond and swap market spreads had eased slightly from the peaks, but were still high by previous standards.  There had recently been some domestic corporate bond issuance in sterling, as well as a more marked return of issuance in international bond markets.  Perhaps more significantly, UK banking markets seemed to have been less affected by the turbulence than capital markets.  Conditions in wholesale money markets seemed reasonably calm.  The syndicated credit markets had remained open;  spreads had risen in this market too, but by rather less than in capital markets.  The September M4 numbers did not suggest emergency drawing down of deposits, and showed continued robust growth in lending to the corporate sector.  It was possible that that reflected reintermediation into the banking sector of some borrowing that would previously have been undertaken in the capital markets.  This was widely believed to be occurring in the US, but dependence on capital market borrowing was much greater there.  Evidence of this happening in the United Kingdom was less clear.  The UK banking sector was, on the basis of currently available information, well capitalised by the standards of recent decades and so prospectively capable of reintermediating credit flows if that were to prove necessary. 20 The Committee agreed that so far there was no evidence of a ‘credit crunch’ in the sense of a material tightening of credit conditions for a given general level of interest rates and borrower credit risk.  The environment had nevertheless changed somewhat. On the one hand, the general level of medium-longer maturity interest rates had fallen in recent months, so that the level of nominal yields (and probably real yields) on corporate bonds had fallen for at least the highest credit ratings, notwithstanding the widening of spreads.  This would tend to be supportive of activity. On the other hand, as the economy slowed and as the shocks from the external environment affected the UK, the creditworthiness of some borrowers was deteriorating, which would affect the terms on which they could obtain credit.  The corporate sector as a whole was, however, stronger financially than in the late 1980s-early 1990s, and thus should generally be better able to withstand a downturn. 21 The Committee agreed that world financial markets were calmer than a few weeks earlier.  But the possibility of a tightening of credit conditions in the future needed to be kept under careful review. The MPC’s November forecast 22 The Committee reviewed its forecast, which was described fully in the Inflation Report published in the week following the meeting. 23 The general shape of the projections was as follows.  Output growth was expected to fall for a year or so before recovering, principally via stronger domestic demand growth.  In the second half of the forecast period and beyond, an important source of this increased demand was public sector consumption and investment, but there was some uncertainty about the timing of public investment spending.  The balance of risks to activity were on the  Monetary Policy Committee 59 downside, largely on account of the external environment and risks to consumption.  The central projection for inflation rose somewhat in the short run before falling.  The balance of risks to the inflation outlook were modestly on the upside until mid-2000 and then modestly on the downside, but overall closer to neutral throughout the forecast period than in August when the balance of risks had clearly been on the upside. 24 There was a more important difference from the August forecast.  For any given level of interest rates, the level of the projections for output growth and inflation were now both lower.  If interest rates were left at 7.25%, the central projection for inflation would undershoot the target at the end of the forecast period. 25 The Committee discussed whether there were any major eventualities not captured in the forecast.  It had increased the short-term uncertainty underlying the published projections to reflect the problems with the AEI numbers, but it was very difficult to judge the degree of extra uncertainty created.  It was possible that further adverse news about the world economy could dent the outlook for output growth still further.  And it was possible that weak world price inflation and the fall in domestic inflation expectations would have a bigger than assumed impact on RPIX. On the other hand, the recent recovery in the equity market meant that at the time of the meeting equity prices were 6% higher than the 15-day average used in the forecast.  Overall the Committee felt that the important factors were reflected in the forecast. 26 The Committee noted that the shape and level of the projections were different when made using market expectations of the likely path of interest rates (as derived from the short sterling futures contract adjusted for the typical premium between unsecured interbank deposit rates and gilt repo rates).  Faster growth was implied, and a central projection for inflation which was above the target throughout 1999 and 2000.  The Inflation Report would show the difference between projections based on constant interest rates and market rates (as at 4 November). 27 The Committee discussed the predictions of a sample of outside forecasters.  The average forecast of GDP in the year to  Q4 1999 was down by one percentage point since August.  Most forecasters predicted recovery in 2000.  Inflation profiles were generally lower than three months ago.  The average of outside forecasts was similar to the Bank’s central projection. Tactical considerations 28 While reiterating its earlier expressed view that there could be no mechanical or precise link between the forecast and policy settings, the Committee agreed that its latest forecast clearly pointed to a further cut in official interest rates.  Before turning to the immediate policy decision, members first discussed a number of tactical considerations. 29 Was there a case for delaying part of any desired rate cut on the grounds that some of the uncertainty about the earnings data should be resolved by the December or January meetings?  The Committee agreed that this should not affect its immediate decision.  It would need to take account of the new information about earnings as and when it became available, changing interest rates then if necessary. 30 What would be the impact of different sized cuts on confidence and expectations in the real economy and financial markets?  A range of views was expressed on this.  One possible view was that, taken in isolation, a cut of more than 25 basis points might create the misleading impression that the outlook was worse than implied by the Committee’s central projection on the grounds that (i) financial markets thought the most likely outcome of the meeting was a cut of 25 basis points;  and (ii) the Committee had so far moved (in both directions) in steps of 25 basis points.  But, against this, any move would in fact be followed by publication of the Inflation Report a week later.  Whatever the Committee’s decision, policy would then be seen in the light of its forecast for inflation. 31 A second possible view was that there would be positive merit in moving by more than 25 basis points in order to display that, as the Committee had said before, it was prepared to move in larger steps.  The Committee agreed that while that might be a welcome by-product of a cut of more than 25 basis points, it could not be part of the reason for such a cut, which had to depend on its assessment of the inflation outlook.  A similarly welcome  by-product, but again not one that could affect the decision, was that a larger than expected cut would underline the symmetry of the Committee’s remit, ie that a prospect of falling below the 21/2% target was taken as seriously as exceeding the target. 32 A third possible view was that the Committee should err on the side of a larger cut in order to underpin business and consumer confidence in the economy.  Against this it was felt that, whatever its size, the effect of a reduction in interest rates on confidence would depend on the justification for it.  The Committee also needed to bear in mind that the larger the cut, the more likely it was that sterling would fall, which would tend to increase the price level and thus temporarily increase future expected inflation. The immediate policy decision 33 By way of background, the Committee noted that over the past six years the economy had on average grown above trend, and until quite recently had still been growing at a rate that could not be sustained given the economy’s productive capacity.  That had been the justification for the past tightening of monetary policy. Relatively high short-term real rates of interest, fiscal policy tightening and the appreciation of the exchange rate had all helped to keep inflation in check, but it had still not fallen below 21/2%, which was indicative of the strength of domestically generated inflationary pressures.  Since August there had been a lot of news affecting the outlook for activity and inflation, including the fall in sterling, the shocks to the world economy, and the evidence from surveys and the Bank’s regional Agents of a sharp fall in business and consumer confidence.  The extent of the lags between these developments and their effect on growth and inflation was highly uncertain, but they implied lower activity growth and inflation than expected in August. 34 Against this background, the Committee discussed the arguments for interest rate cuts of 25 basis points, 50 basis points, and of up to 75 basis points. 35 Possible arguments identified for a 25 basis point cut were that the unusually high uncertainty about the earnings data pointed to caution in any move;  that the Committee should avoid surprising financial markets given the risk of sterling falling if it did so;  and that the Committee should avoid taking actions that could be construed as trying to fine tune output growth in 1999.  On the first of these points the Committee agreed that if the earnings data were substantially revised upwards the interest rate move might need to be reversed, but that was not per se an argument for moving in small steps now.  On the second point, the Committee agreed that the risk of surprising the financial markets could not justify limiting the cut to a size that would leave the central projection for inflation materially below the target in the second year of the forecast.  On the third point, the Committee agreed that monetary policy could not have a significant impact on output growth in 1999 given the lags in its effects.  But this did not amount to an argument for a  25 basis point cut. 36 The arguments identified for a 50 basis point cut, supported in varying degrees by those members of the Committee who voted for this course of action, were as follows.  First, on the central projection, with a 50 basis point cut inflation would rise slightly above the target before returning to around 2.5% at the two year  Inflation Report:  February 1999 60 horizon, with the risks initially on the upside and later on the downside, and with uncertainty greater at the longer horizons.  By contrast, if rates were cut by 75 basis points, inflation would be above the target throughout the year 2000 on the central projection and up to the third quarter of 2000 even if the balance of downside risks assumed in the forecast materialised.  Second, a larger cut might cause sterling to fall by more than was taken into account in the forecast.  Third, notwithstanding the opportunity to explain any policy decision in the following week’s Inflation Report, there could well be a prolonged effect on perceptions of the Committee’s assessment of the outlook, with a risk that people, businesses and markets mistakenly concluded that the Committee knew something that it had not disclosed about the outlook. 37 Among those members favouring an immediate 50 basis point cut, there was a range of views on the likely future course of policy.  On one view, it was more likely than not that further cuts would at some point be needed, but the lags in the economy meant that it was not optimal to make those cuts now.  It was argued that further cuts could over time be necessary because at 6.75% official rates would still most probably be above the ‘neutral’ rate implied by an equilibrium real interest rate and the 21/2% inflation target.  It was also possible that the near-term downward pressures on UK domestic prices might be greater than reflected in the projection. On another view, the short run outlook for future policy was more evenly balanced, bearing in mind continued domestically generated inflationary pressures. 38 The arguments identified for a cut of up to 75 basis points were as follows.  First, given that the balance of risks to inflation was on the downside at the end of the forecast period, inflation could be expected to undershoot the target in about two years’ time if rates were cut by only 50 basis points.  The size of cut should take account of these risks.  A cut of more than 50 basis points— possibly 75 basis points, possibly in between—could be viewed as taking out insurance against those risks, with the precise size depending on the weight given to the downside risks and the value placed on insurance.  Second, a larger cut might fortify otherwise fragile business and consumer confidence, helping to guard against the effects of encircling gloom and thus worse outcomes than featured in the Committee’s forecast.  Third, while a larger cut might well surprise the markets, it could be carefully explained in the Inflation Report, so that the cost of any surprise should be  short-lived.  Fourth, cutting by more than 50 basis points was preferable to cutting by 50 basis points with an expectation of making further cuts later. 39 The Governor invited members of the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate be cut by 50 basis points to 6.75%.  Eight members of the Committee (the Governor, Mervyn King, David Clementi, Alan Budd, Charles Goodhart, DeAnne Julius, Ian Plenderleith and John Vickers) voted for the proposition.  Willem Buiter voted against, preferring a cut of  75 basis points. 40 The following members of the Committee were present: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Alan Budd Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers 41 Gus O’Donnell was also present as the Treasury representative.  Monetary Policy Committee 61 1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee on 30 October 1998, in advance of its meeting.  At the start of the Committee meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and that information is included in the Annex. I Financial markets Foreign exchange 2 Between 6 October and 8 October, $/yen had fallen from  132 to 112.  DM/yen had fallen by almost as much.  The trigger for these unusually large fall may have been the perception that progress was being made to resolve the banking problems in Japan. Poor liquidity had exacerbated the fall in the $/yen exchange rate, as participants who had borrowed cheap yen to fund positions elsewhere had attempted to unwind their positions.  After that, the yen had stabilised, perhaps reflecting a perception that a rate just below 120 was closer to its ‘equilibrium’ value.  One-month implied volatility for $/yen had remained at historically high levels, even though it had halved since 8 October.  The dollar had also fallen against other major currencies in recent months, reflecting expectations of interest rate cuts (which had been borne out) and concerns about the impact on the US trade balance of a Latin American recession.  However, on a broader measure of the effective exchange rate the dollar had only fallen by 4%. 3 The correlation between movement in the dollar and sterling had remained strong, and had possibly strengthened.  The 8 October MPC announcement cutting rates by 25 basis points and the 14 October downward revision to average earnings had coincided with significant moves in sterling, although the former came at the height of the $/yen turmoil, which appeared to have exaggerated the upward move.  Government bond and money markets 4 Implied interest rates had fallen at the short end of the yield curve following the MPC’s 25 basis point cut in October, and again after the US cut.  At longer maturities, the recovering equity market and sharp currency moves had been associated with higher yields. Most international bond markets had fallen following the sharp appreciation in the yen.  At the same time, market participants in the United States and United Kingdom had begun to expect more aggressive monetary easing, and this had been reflected in less inverted bond yield curves.  But the currency movements had also meant that some market participants had looked to close out their positions and, coupled with poor liquidity, these technical factors had probably exacerbated the yield changes.  Implied volatility in the long gilt future had fallen from a peak of around 13%, but had remained high, and futures turnover had fallen, suggesting that the markets remained less liquid than usual. 5 In the futures market, implied interest rates had fallen by about 30 basis points since the previous MPC meeting, whereas longer contracts had been at roughly the same level, implying that the market had brought forward when it expected rates to be cut, but not the extent of the easing it expected.  There had been a spread of 100 basis points between current three-month Libor and the short sterling March contract, implying that significant cuts in rates were expected before Easter.  A few market participants had expected a 50 basis point cut in November, although most had anticipated 25 basis points. 6 The spread between interbank and CD rates and gilt repo had been unusually high in late October.  This could be argued to have understated the rise in credit risk premia demanded by the market, because some weaker credits might have withdrawn from the market.  On the other hand, an increase in short term deposits at the major banks, subject to sterling stock liquidity requirements, would have tended to increase their demand for liquid assets including repo, and this could have worked to widen the interbank-repo spread. Equity markets 7 Equity indices had risen since the previous MPC meeting in most international markets.  In the United Kingdom, the relative fall in banking sector share prices in September had been reversed, while indices for utilities, property and food retailers, which had been seen as ‘safe havens’ during market turbulence, had underperformed the market.  Implied volatilities for the FT-SE 100 and S&P 500 had declined from their September peak, but remained above their 1998 averages.  Analysts’ forecasts for growth in earnings per share over the next year had declined further.  But analysts’ longer-term outlook for growth in earnings per share had remained constant, as they had done for most of 1998.  The number of profits warnings had been higher than a year earlier, with concerns about demand and problems in emerging markets frequently cited as reasons. II Monetary and credit conditions Monetary quantities 8 The (provisional) twelve-month growth rate of notes and coin (adjusted for 50p and £2 coin effects) had been 5.2% in October, compared with 5.7% in September.  The three and  six-month annualised growth rates had also fallen in October. Annual growth in broad money (M4) had been 9.0% in September, compared with 8.7% in August.  M4 growth in the third quarter of 1998 had been slightly up on the second quarter (2.2% in Q3, compared with 2.1% in Q2).  9 Households’ M4 had grown by more in September (£1.6 billion) than in August (£1.1 billion), with the twelve-month rate at 6.1%.  The twelve-month rate of growth of M4 of Other Financial Corporations (OFCs) had been 19.2% in September. According to the Merrill Lynch survey of fund managers, the ratio of cash to portfolio value of Insurance Companies and Pension Funds (ICPFs) had risen from 4.9% in September to 6.9% in October. 10 The slight pick-up in annual growth in aggregate Divisia in the third quarter (7.8%, compared with 7.7% in the second quarter) had been broadly similar to the pattern in the M4 data.  Within the aggregate, household Divisia growth had been unchanged in the third quarter at 6.6%;  the annual growth in OFCs’ Divisia had fallen back from 16.8% in the second quarter to 16.2% in the third; and the growth in Divisia of Private Non-Financial Corporations (PNFCs) had increased from 5.6% to 7.5% in the third quarter. 11 Aggregate M4 lending had been £6.2 billion in September, similar to August (£6.6 billion).  M4 lending to households had been increasing, with three and six-month annualised growth rates higher than the annual growth rate of 7.4%.  Within lending, annual growth in total secured lending to individuals, at 5.9%, had picked up slightly in the third quarter.  There had been a third consecutive monthly fall in the number of loan approvals for house purchase in September.  The annual growth in unsecured lending to individuals had remained strong (19.0% in the third quarter) and net credit card borrowing had also increased in September (by £439 million compared with £406 million in August), with the twelve-month growth rate at 26.5%.  There had been anecdotal evidence of a modest rise in arrears.  The twelve-month growth rate in lending to OFCs had been weaker in September, with a flow of £1.7 billion Annex:  Summary of data presented by Bank staff  Inflation Report:  February 1999 62 compared with £2.1 billion in August, with the annual rate of growth at 16.6%. Monetary prices 12 The 8 October cut in the Bank’s repo rate had not yet been passed on by banks and building societies into standard  variable-rate mortgages;  but many had announced that they would reduce standard variable rates from November.  In the secured market, fixed rates on mortgages had continued to fall, reflecting falls in comparable swap rates. 13 There was no direct measure of ex ante short-term real interest rates, but a measure could be constructed using the Merrill Lynch survey of fund managers’ short-term inflation expectations for the end of 1999.  This suggested that the real forward rate for 1999 had fallen from 4.3% in September to 4.1% in October. Have UK corporate credit conditions tightened? 14 Bank staff had examined whether the UK company sector had experienced a tightening in credit conditions.  Spreads on corporate bond yields over gilts had fallen since the previous MPC meeting, although they had remained at high levels relative to the 1990s average.  Similarly, US corporate bond indices had shown the credit spread on investment grade bonds to be at or near their highest levels in the 1990s.  A similar picture had emerged when looking at spreads in the swaps markets, both in the United States and the United Kingdom.  15 The syndicated loan market remained open, although spreads had widened by about 10 basis points for higher grades and more for lower-rated companies.  Conversations with market participants had suggested that some loan demand had been deferred;  others had borrowed before the recent turbulence hit the markets, and thought that it might be more difficult to borrow now. 16 Bankers had reported there had been no material change in the terms applied to customers of a given risk.  However, the creditworthiness of some firms had fallen with the worsening in the economic outlook.  A survey of major clearing banks had revealed that the demand for finance from small firms had been steady in the past six months, and for large firms had, if anything, increased.  17 Annual growth in PNFCs’ M4 deposits had been 6.5% in the third quarter, compared with 5.9% in the second quarter.  Growth in M4 lending to PNFCs had risen in the third quarter, to 6.0% compared with 5.1% in Q2.  Neither had suggested a rationing of credit, nor an emergency drawdown of deposits.  Total external finance had been steady at £3.2 billion in September. 18 One question had been whether the banking system’s capital could support a material reintermediation of credit if capital market borrowing remained low for a prolonged period.  The capital positions of the large UK banks in 1998 H1 had shown risk-asset ratios above the Basle 8% minimum. 19 Other evidence from the CBI Industrial Trends Survey in October 1998 had shown that 6% of firms thought that constraints on external finance might limit their ability to undertake investment.  This had been the highest proportion since January 1993.  But uncertainty about demand had been reported as a larger constraint on investment (56%, compared with 50% in September).  20 As to the financial strength of the corporate sector if credit conditions were to tighten, PNFCs’ capital gearing in 1998 Q2 (defined as the ratio of net debt outstanding to the market valuation of the capital stock), at 24.5%, was well below its previous peak (41.4% in 1990 Q3).  However, this partly reflected the rise in equity prices in recent years.  PNFCs’ income gearing, at 20.9%, had been well below the peak of 39.0% in 1990 Q2, although it had risen from the low of 16.7% in 1996 Q2 to 20.9% in 1998 Q2.  This had probably been related to repo rate rises over the period, and weakening profits.  Unlike companies in the United States, PNFCs in the United Kingdom had modest non-equity capital market obligations, compared with their liquid assets. III The international economy 21 In the United States, a slowdown in the real economy had become more evident.  Quarterly consumption growth in 1998 Q3 had slowed to 1.0% from 1.5% in both Q1 and Q2, and investment growth had fallen to 0.4% in Q3, from 4.7% in Q1 and 3.1% in Q2. Overall, US GDP had grown by 0.8%, to 3.4% higher than a year before. 22 Industrial production in the United States had fallen by 0.3% in September, to 2.5% higher than a year earlier.  Capacity utilisation had been 81.1% in September and, although distorted by the GM strike, had been trending lower since the end of 1997.  The NAPM index had fallen to 48.3 in October, from 49.4 in September. The US trade balance had widened to $16.8 billion in August from $14.5 billion in July.  This had been because of a larger goods deficit;  the services surplus had remained little changed.  Export volumes had fallen year-on-year for the second consecutive month, while the growth in import volumes had slowed.  US consumer confidence had fallen by 9 points in October, its fourth consecutive monthly fall, to its lowest level since October 1997.  Annual CPI inflation had fallen to 1.4% in September from 1.7% in August, and annual average earnings growth had fallen to 4% in the year to September, from 4.1% in August.  The IMF had forecast US GDP growth to be 2.0% in 1999, down from 3.5% in 1998. 23 In the prospective euro area (EU11), industrial confidence had fallen further in August and September in most member countries.  Industrial production had rebounded in Germany, rising by 3.1% on Q2, but had fallen back in France (-0.1%) and Italy  (-0.9%).  Consumer confidence in the EU11 had fallen by  1 percentage point between July and September.  Annual EU11 consumer price inflation on the harmonised measure had fallen to 1.0% in September down from 1.2% in August.  Harmonised inflation had fallen in Germany (to 0.6%) and France (to 0.5%). Money supply across the EU11 had grown by 4.7% in the year to July, down from 5.7% in June. 24 Japan’s industrial production had fallen 8.4% in the year to September.  Inventories had fallen by 1.8% over the year.  Total employment had fallen by 1.1% over the year to September, with job losses concentrated in the construction and manufacturing sectors.  Retail sales in Japan had fallen by 5.1% in September from a year ago.  Imports had fallen by 9.3%, while exports had grown 3.9% over the year to September.  Japan’s trade surplus with the United States was ¥0.7 trillion in September, and ¥0.4 trillion with the European Union.  Deflationary pressures had been continuing— wholesale prices in September had fallen by 1.5% on an annual basis, and annual consumer price inflation in September had fallen to -0.2%.  The IMF had forecast a fall in GDP in 1998 of 2.5% and a rise of 0.5% in 1999. IV Demand and output 25 The preliminary estimate for GDP growth in 1998 Q3 had been 0.5%, the same rate as in Q2.  The annual rate of growth had slowed from 3.0% in the year to Q2 to 2.5% in the year to Q3. Service sector output had grown by 0.6% in Q3, the same rate as in Q2.  Manufacturing output had fallen by 0.6% in August and 0.4% in September.  Survey evidence had suggested that the fall in manufacturing output would be the beginning of a sustained decline.  Manufacturing output over the third quarter had fallen slightly, by 0.1%, in contrast to ONS indications in the GDP preliminary estimate for the third quarter of ‘a small increase’. This had raised the possibility of a downward revision to GDP growth in 1998 Q3. 26 The boost to GDP growth from utilities output in 1998 Q2 had not unwound in Q3 so the level remained relatively high.  Monetary Policy Committee 63 Monthly industrial production data had shown that electricity, gas and water supply had increased by 1.1% in 1998 Q3, though output had fallen by 1.6% in September.  The ONS had also reported that construction and agricultural output had risen overall in Q3. 27 On the expenditure side, retail sales had fallen by 0.4% in September, having increased in the previous two months.  Annual growth over the latest three months had increased to 3.1% in September from 2.4% in August.  This had partly reflected weak sales in September 1997.  Nonetheless, ONS data had suggested that, although slowing, growth had remained above average, a stronger out-turn than indicated by either the CBI Distributive Trades Survey or data from the British Retail Consortium. Quarterly growth in retail sales volumes in Q3 had been 0.7%, compared with 0.2% in Q2 (though consumption of retail goods in the National Accounts had increased by 0.9% in Q2).  Services consumption had fallen in Q2, because of lower catering and financial services spending.  Output data so far available had suggested that another fall in the third quarter was unlikely. Overall, it was possible that household spending would increase by more in Q3 than in Q2 (0.4%). 28 Analysis of surveys of consumer confidence supported a picture of an underlying slowdown in consumption growth.  The GfK and MORI surveys had declined further in October.  The MORI balance had fallen to -46 from -37 in September, as low as in October 1992 and September 1990.  The aggregate GfK balance had fallen to -8.2, 18 points below its recent peak.  In the past, the level of consumer confidence had been a timely, coincident indicator of household spending growth.  The recent deterioration in the GfK survey had been because of deteriorating sentiment about the general economic situation.  Perceptions about households’ own situations had held up better.  Analysis had shown that survey responses to general economy-wide questions had been, if anything, better correlated with spending growth in the past than household-specific questions.  Analysis had also suggested that consumer confidence contained additional information about spending over and above other determinants of consumption such as income, wealth etc;  and that it had some predictive power for future spending as well as current spending. 29 The Halifax and Nationwide prices indices had both recorded increases in October.  But housing turnover had fallen in September, with particulars delivered 5.7% lower than a year ago, though 4.8% higher over the latest three months than the previous three months.  Net lending secured on dwellings had fallen in September, leaving the twelve-month growth rate unchanged at 5.8%;  and loan approvals had fallen to their lowest level in 1998. Survey data from RICS and HBF had also indicated activity moderating. 30 Service sector investment intentions for plant and equipment had fallen from a balance of +27 to +14 in the latest British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) survey, though they had remained around their average level since 1989.  Manufacturing investment intentions had fallen from a balance of +13 in Q2, to 0 in Q3.  In the October CBI quarterly Industrial Trends Survey, the balance had fallen from -21 to -32 for plant and equipment, and from -26 to -36 for buildings.  However, construction orders had remained relatively high, rising by 6% in the three months to August.  The CIPS Report on Construction had indicated falling orders in October for the first time this year, although the optimism index had remained strong. 31 There had been some evidence of rising stocks in the manufacturing and retail sectors in survey data.  The CBI Industrial Trends Survey had reported a rise in the balance of firms reporting excessive stocks (+26 in October).  The CBI Distributive Trades Survey had recorded a higher balance of retailers reporting high stocks relative to expected sales:  +23 in October, compared with an average balance since 1992 of +19.  Retailers were likely to unwind any excess inventories fairly quickly. 32 The PSNCR had been £1.6 billion in September, and £2.7 billion over the first six months of the financial year 1998/99. Spending had been 2.7% higher over the first six months of 1998/99 compared with a year earlier.  This had suggested continued growth in government consumption in 1998 Q3. 33 Goods trade data had pointed to a negative contribution from net trade in 1998 Q3.  There had been little change in the trade deficit in August:  £1.2 billion compared with £1.4 billion in July (excluding oil and erratics).  The deficit with EU countries had narrowed, while the deficit with non-EU countries had widened. And there had been a large increase in the deficit with non-EU countries in September.  Import and export volumes had both increased in the three months to August, but imports by more.  For 1998 Q3 as a whole, imports from non-EU countries had risen by 4.6%;  exports had fallen by 0.7%. 34 Surveys suggested that business sentiment had continued to weaken.  The BCC survey had reported negative balances for home deliveries and home orders in the manufacturing sector of -12 and -16 respectively for Q3, compared with +3 and +2 respectively for Q2.  And there had been further sharp falls in export orders and deliveries.  This had brought the BCC survey more in to line with the CBI survey, both indicating further falls in manufacturing output.  BCC services balances had remained positive, but had fallen.  Home orders and deliveries balances had fallen for the third consecutive quarter, and by the largest degree between Q2 and Q3 since the previous recession, consistent with a slowdown in services output growth in Q4. 35 There had also been a further decline in CBI Industrial Trends survey balances.  The business optimism balance had fallen to its lowest level since July 1980.  This might be a better indicator of output in the manufacturing sector rather than GDP given the nature of the downturn.  Sentiment towards exports had stabilised, but at very low levels.  In contrast, indicators of domestic activity had fallen sharply:  the reported output balance from -4 to -30, expected output from -8 to -29.  The CIPS Report on Manufacturing output index had fallen to 41.6 in October, a new low, and the largest monthly fall since the survey began in 1991.  The CIPS Report on Services had shown the first fall in the incoming new business index since the survey began in mid 1996.  And the outstanding business index had continued to fall, and by its largest amount in October (44.9). V Labour market 36 The Labour Force Survey (LFS) measure of employment had risen by 122,000 (0.5%) in the three months to August, compared with the previous three months.  If anything, the rate of increase had appeared to be rising—the average quarterly increase over the past year had been 77,000.  Thus the contrast between the strength in LFS employment and the weakness in recent Workforce Jobs figures had become even more marked, though more weight should be attached to the LFS figures (given their lower sampling variance and the possibility of special factors affecting the Workforce Jobs data).  The increase in LFS employment in June to August had reflected a large 222,000 (0.9%) increase in employees, partly offset by a 94,000 (2.9%) fall in the numbers self-employed.  And it had been more than accounted for by an increase in full-time employment (part-time employment fell slightly).  Total hours worked had increased by 0.6% over the quarter, so hours per head were broadly unchanged. 37 Turning to survey information, the CIPS October surveys had suggested that employment growth in services had been weakening but remained positive, construction employment had been unchanged, and the rate of job loss in manufacturing had been increasing.  This sectoral picture was broadly consistent with reports from the Bank’s regional Agents.  The BCC survey for Q3 had shown a fall in employment intentions in services, though they had remained positive, while the balance of manufacturers  Inflation Report:  February 1999 64 expecting to recruit staff had fallen sharply to almost zero.  The CBI Industrial Trends Survey for Q3 had also shown a large deterioration in manufacturing employment intentions, the seasonally adjusted balance falling to its lowest level since 1993. 38 New notifications of vacancies had risen by 4,000 in September, with the stock of vacancies broadly unchanged. National press advertising had risen to another high in August, reflecting sustained demand for staff at the top end of the labour market.  The FRES report had showed that recruitment agency business had continued to increase in September, but the rate of growth had fallen back to its weakest this year.  The BCC survey had shown some easing in recruitment difficulties in both manufacturing and services, though they still persisted.  And the CBI Industrial Trends survey for Q3 had shown a further fall in the balance of manufacturers quoting skill shortages as a factor likely to limit output. 39 LFS unemployment had increased by 9,000 in the three months to August, compared with the previous three months.  The rise had partly reflected a 28,000 increase in unemployment among 16–17 year olds.  Despite the rise, the rate of LFS unemployment remained unchanged to the nearest decimal point at 6.3%.  The claimant count had continued to fall in September (by 12,000), with part of the fall likely to have reflected a New Deal effect.   40 According to LFS figures, the number of economically inactive people of working age had fallen by 93,000 in the three months to August, which contrasted with the increases recorded in the previous three quarters. 41 The ONS had announced a further set of revisions to the earnings data on 14 October following a rebasing exercise, which had resulted in significant revisions to the earnings data going back to 1991.  The key factors behind the revisions had been:  the use of new employment weights to aggregate earnings in different industries;  the application of new grossing factors to firms in different size bands to make the sample more representative;  and the use of a new public/private sector classification, which reflected legal as well as industrial status.  However, there were a number of features of the revised data that had been difficult to understand and, partly for this reason, an external enquiry into the figures had been set up.  The ONS subsequently issued a press release on  2 November suspending publication of the figures until it was satisfied about their quality. 42 According to the revised figures, headline annual earnings growth had peaked in 1998 in June (at 5.2%), not in April as previously thought, and had dropped back to 4.6% in July.  But more puzzling was that the revised series had suggested that aggregate earnings growth had fallen rather than risen in 1997, at a time when the quantities data had suggested that the labour market was tightening.  This change in profile was more pronounced in the services data;  the manufacturing profile was much more similar to the old data.  43 Another puzzle in the revised data had been that they suggested that public sector earnings had accelerated from  mid-1997, not grown at a broadly constant rate of around 2.5% to 3.0% as had previously been thought.  On the new figures, headline public sector earnings grew by 4.6% in the year to July (up from 4.5% in June), which compared with private sector earnings growth of 4.7% (down from 5.4%).   44 A further puzzle in the new data concerned bonuses. Previously it had been thought that irregular pay had constantly made a positive contribution to the annual growth of average earnings in 1997 and 1998.  But according to the new figures, the contribution had been erratic, and the large positive contribution of bonuses and other irregular payments in March 1998, seen in the unrevised data, was no longer apparent. 45 The revised figures had seemed difficult to reconcile with other measures of earnings, none of which had suggested weaker growth during 1997.  The growth rate of the National Accounts measure of wages and salaries per head had increased during 1997–98, though these figures were partly derived from the Average Earnings Index and were therefore subject to be revised if the quality of the new series was confirmed.  The Reward Index of earnings growth had also been stronger than the revised Average Earnings Index in 1997 and 1998, despite having dropped back recently (to 5.1% in September).  And a comparison with figures from the annual New Earnings Survey also suggested that earnings growth in recent years had if anything been closer to the old average earnings series, than the revised one.   46 The view that wage pressure had eased in 1997 was also not supported by evidence from wage settlements which had increased through 1997 and the early part of 1998.  And there had been no evidence of a slowdown in wage settlements in recent months:  the twelve-month employment weighted mean measure remained at 3.7% in September for the fifth consecutive month. VI Prices 47 Commodity prices had continued to fall in September.  The Bank index excluding oil had fallen by 0.6% in September, mainly because of metals and food prices.  The index had fallen by 18% since its peak in March 1996.  But United Nations data had suggested that the recent weakness of commodity prices relative  to consumer prices was in line with the trend change over the previous thirty years.  Input price deflation had persisted:  prices had fallen by 1.1% in September and by 9.8% since  September 1997.  The price of Brent crude oil had fallen to $13.19 a barrel by 28 October. 48 Annual output price inflation had fallen to its lowest rates for over twenty years in September:  output price inflation excluding excise duties (PPIY) to -0.6% (its lowest rate since 1975) and total output price inflation to 0.3% (its lowest rate since 1960).  The CBI and BCC surveys had continued to suggest that output price inflation might fall further.  Their weakness relative to the official data might have been explained by the split between gross and net output price inflation.  The gross index, which includes intermediate prices within the manufacturing sector, had been falling, while the net index had risen slightly, implying intermediate price deflation.  It was possible the survey balances had reflected gross output price deflation better than the net numbers published in the headline producer price index.  Trade prices had also continued to fall.  Export prices to the European Union had fallen by 0.4% in August.  Import prices had fallen further in 1998 from countries outside the European Union (-9.4% in the year to September), but had remained broadly unchanged from other EU countries (-5.9% in the year to September). 49 RPIX inflation had remained at 2.5% in September, while RPIY and RPI inflation had both fallen by 0.1 percentage point, to 2.0% and 3.2% respectively.  RPIX services prices had risen by 3.5% in the year to September, up from 3.2% in August.  That had reflected the reduction of the VAT rate payable on domestic fuel in September 1997, which had fallen out of the annual inflation rate. Household services had risen sharply, partly owing to private school fees.  The HICP inflation rate had risen by 0.2 percentage points in September to 1.5%, whereas the RPIX inflation rate had remained unchanged.  But the difference had been almost entirely due to rounding.  The retail sales deflator had been revised as part of the rebasing of the retail sales index, which had been published since the previous MPC meeting.  But annual retail sales price inflation had remained close to its previous rates and stood at 0.6% in September. VII Reports by the Bank’s regional Agents 50 The Bank’s regional Agents had undertaken a survey of their contacts on domestic credit conditions.  They had asked whether the demand for finance had changed over recent months.  40% of  Monetary Policy Committee 65 respondents reported unchanged usage of finance, 48% increased use and 12% reduced use.  Of those who had increased their demand for loans, some had done so because of deteriorating trading conditions.  They had also asked whether firms thought that the terms and conditions of finance offered by banks had worsened. Most contacts had said that they had not.  10% of contacts had reported that they had recently had a loan request turned down. The Agents had also contacted local clearing bank representatives. They had suggested that they had for some time been seeking to improve loan quality and exercising more due diligence, and that this had not been connected with the recent turbulence in financial markets.  Some contacts had reported that the terms of syndicated loans had tightened. 51 Looking ahead, the Agents reported that contacts had expected credit conditions to tighten in the future as the economy slowed.  Some respondents had thought that small and  medium-sized enterprises would have been most affected by this. The Agents had also asked about the exposure of their contacts to emerging markets, which had appeared to be limited.  For example, although 60% of manufacturing firms had some sales exposure, only 20% of these had more than 10% of their sales in emerging markets. 52 The Agents also reported on general discussions with their contacts.  The outlook for activity reported by manufacturing firms had been more in line with the deterioration recorded in the survey data than the most recent ONS data.  All Agents had reported further declines in orders, and there were particular concerns about the first half of 1999.  Export orders had remained extremely weak and some firms had reported a loss of domestic market share to importers.  Services growth had continued to slow, and had spread to sectors such as catering and leisure.  Retail spending had slowed, with firms reporting falling sales of clothing and household goods in late September and October.  In the labour market, regional divergence had increased:  skill shortages had persisted in parts of the service sector in the south-east of England, but elsewhere prospects had deteriorated.   Inflation Report:  February 1999 66 1 The Committee discussed the prospects for global activity and prices;  slower-than-expected consumption growth;  other indicators of domestic activity;  the mixed signals from the labour market;  monetary conditions and financial market data;  and other issues including tactics;  before turning to the immediate policy decision.  Prior to the meeting, the Committee were briefed orally by Bank staff on the progress of the investigation into the Average Earnings Index, publication of which had been suspended by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) on 2 November 1998. The prospects for global activity and prices 2 Stronger-than-expected data on employment and GDP in the third quarter had suggested that the United States economy continued to be surprisingly robust.  However, expectations  were that US growth would be slower in the coming year.  The Japanese economy had weakened further, with GDP falling in Q3 by 0.7%. 3 In Europe, Japan and the United States, there seemed to be a continuing downward trend in business confidence—despite the strong GDP figures in Germany and the United States.  This might mean that businesses were beginning to feel the trade effects arising from the crises in Asia and other emerging markets.  The declines in business confidence might also reflect a squeeze on profits as weakening world demand had increased competition and contributed to downward pressure on world prices.  Since the previous meeting, the OECD, the World Trade Organisation and the World Bank had revised down their forecasts for world trade in 1999.  Although domestic demand in the industrialised countries remained relatively robust so far, declines in business confidence were consistent with a prospective slowdown in world trade.  It was clear that the expected changes in world trade implied larger current account deficits in the industrialised countries, but it was not clear how these would be spread across countries. 4 Oil and other commodity prices had continued to fall.  The one-month price of Brent crude had fallen below $10 per barrel at the time of the meeting.  Although caused partly by a fall in world demand, the fall in oil prices should act as a positive supply shock to industrialised countries and would therefore be supportive of future activity.  However, the effects could be de-stabilising in the short run:  the terms-of-trade effect would be a significant negative shock for those countries heavily dependent on oil revenues. 5 Although the world financial situation had improved slightly, and backward-looking data for the real economies of the United States and Europe had remained firm, the Committee concluded that the forward indicators of world activity and prices were probably softer than at the time the November Inflation Report projections were finalised. Consumption 6 Consumption growth in Q3 had been below that assumed in the November Inflation Report central projection and retail sales growth suggested that the weakening of consumption growth had thus far continued into Q4.  Looking back at the out-turns for consumption in 1998, growth had been systematically lower than the Committee had expected earlier in the year.  While the forecast errors were within the usual statistical error bands on models of consumption behaviour, it was important to try to understand the possible causes of the apparent slowdown in consumption. 7 The out-turns for consumption growth did not appear to be entirely consistent with its fundamental determinants:  labour income had continued growing strongly and total net wealth had remained high throughout 1998. 8 Leaving aside the possibility of inaccurate data, the Committee discussed a number of potential reasons for the  slower-than-expected consumption growth.  One was that the effects on consumers expenditure of windfall payouts to consumers in 1997, following the conversion of a number of financial institutions from mutual to PLC status, might have been more bunched than expected.  The Bank’s analysis of windfall spending had suggested that some consumers would bring forward their purchases of consumer durables.  If this had distorted the natural replacement cycle, the 1998 data might be reflecting a negative effect as fewer replacement items were purchased. 9 A second possible explanation was that consumers were worried about the outlook for employment and hence had been saving more than had been assumed in the Bank forecast. 10 A third possible explanation was that consumers had not reacted to the measured increases in wealth in the same way as the average of their past responses.  The reaction to an increase in  asset prices, in particular equity prices, might also depend on what had caused the price rise.  Consumers might react differently to changes in the discount rate (the real interest rate appeared to  have fallen) than to changes in expected post-tax corporate earnings.  And changes in discount rates might themselves be a reflection of changing household preferences (because of demographics for example) as between present and future consumption.  Consumers might also have perceived the rise in equity prices to be temporary. 11 It was also possible that the effects of the fiscal tightening might not have been captured fully in earlier forecasts of consumption.  The changes in the last two Budgets had had much of their initial impact on the corporate sector, and hence on the personal sector via its ownership of the corporate sector.  It was difficult to be sure that the tax changes had been properly captured in the relationship between consumption and measured wealth and income. 12 A fifth possible explanation was that weak consumer confidence could lead to a self-fulfilling outcome of weaker demand, which would have the effect of justifying and adding to the initial pessimism. 13 A sixth possible explanation was that consumers might now be more price sensitive and so were waiting for retailers to cut prices further before spending.  For example, the Bank had received anecdotal evidence from the regional Agents that discount clothing stores had been expanding their market share at the expense of traditional established department and chain stores. 14 The Committee considered these possible explanations but concluded that none of the six explanations proposed was sufficient on its own. 15 One of the counterparts to weaker consumption growth had been a bigger-than-expected build-up in inventories.  In the third quarter there had been a marked accumulation of manufacturing inventories of finished goods, while retail inventories had been growing steadily over the year.  The November Inflation Report had already built in a significant negative effect on GDP growth from an inventory cycle during 1999 but the latest data perhaps increased the downside risk to that projection. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 9–10 December 1998  Monetary Policy Committee 67 Other activity indicators 16 GDP growth in Q3 had been revised down from 0.5% to 0.4%.  This was the first quarter of growth clearly below trend since 1996 Q2.  The National Institute of Economic and Social Research’s monthly estimate of GDP was indicating zero growth in the three months to the end of November.  It was, therefore, now possible that the fourth quarter could be even weaker than the Inflation Report central projection of a small positive growth rate. 17 The survey data had continued to deteriorate.  The three surveys from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) for manufacturing, services and construction were now all indicating falls in output.  The Committee noted that the trend in activity growth indicated by the surveys remained downward. Although it was not yet clear whether Q4 growth would be weaker than expected, the downside risks had increased since the Committee’s previous meeting. 18 The Committee considered the possibility that the BRC’s ‘like-for-like’ adjustment was distorting downwards its measure of underlying retail sales growth and that the unadjusted measure (which had been closer to ONS data in recent months) was a better guide.  19 The trade data in Q3 had shown a significant widening of the trade deficit reflecting strong import growth, possibly reflecting the strong investment and inventories numbers.  The Committee was reluctant to read too much into quarterly swings in the external accounts.  The negative effects of weaker world demand and the appreciation of sterling had been clear in the trend for exports for some time. Labour market 20 The labour market quantities data had continued to indicate growth in employment, but at a somewhat slower rate. Unemployment data were beginning to show small increases. Business surveys, such as the CIPS employment survey and the Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services survey, both for November, generally showed a weaker employment picture. 21 Data on pay settlements were relatively stable at around 33/4%.  Wage drift was perhaps more likely to be falling than rising, given the slowdown in output growth.  So, although the labour market remained tight, it was possible that it was no longer tightening and some indicators suggested that it might even be beginning to ease.  On the other hand the Reed Personnel Services skill shortages index showed a further rise for Q4 and official figures on the stock of unfilled vacancies were at a record high. National press advertising had also remained buoyant. 22 The Agents had reported considerable concern amongst contacts about the effects of the Working Time Directive, mainly about the level of bureaucracy and the minimum holiday entitlement.  It was not clear how big an effect the directive would have on costs or prices.  Prices and inflation expectations 23 Inflation forecasts, surveys of financial market professionals and derived inflation expectations from index-linked gilts all seemed to be broadly consistent with the 21/2% RPIX inflation target.  It was possible that surveys of the inflation expectations of the general public, which remained above 21/2%, would decline towards the target as RPI inflation fell relative to RPIX inflation. This reduction in inflation expectations might diminish some of the upside risks to inflation. Monetary conditions 24 Aggregate M4 growth had continued at annual rates of over 9% and the Committee discussed whether it was possible to have low output growth when real broad money was growing so strongly.  Historical evidence suggested that real M4 growth had not always weakened before a slowdown in activity growth, so the Committee could not infer much about the imminent risks to activity.  Furthermore, stripping out the contribution of Other Financial Corporations (OFCs) to broad money growth gave somewhat lower annual growth rates of around 6%. 25 Other monetary and financial indicators had remained firm: notes and coin were growing at over 5% per annum, equity prices had remained at high levels, and house price inflation was easing, but remained at 4.9% and 6.9% per annum on the Halifax and Nationwide measures.  If activity growth continued to slow, one might expect a simultaneous slowdown in broad money growth, possibly alongside a fall in asset prices. 26 On the credit side, there had been few signs of distress borrowing in the corporate sector, and the growth of lending to the personal sector had remained strong—particularly for unsecured credit. The level of interest rates 27 The Committee discussed whether it was helpful to think about the appropriate level of nominal interest rates by reference to the concept of a ‘neutral’ level, which provides neither stimulus nor restraint to the economy.  A broad estimate of the neutral short nominal interest rate could in principle be estimated by combining short-run inflation expectations with an estimate of an average short real interest rate. 28 Inflation expectations appeared to have fallen and it was no longer implausible to think of them as being broadly consistent with the 21/2% target for RPIX inflation.  Some members of the Committee concluded that the appropriate assumption might be a little higher than this given that domestically generated inflation was probably well above 21/2% and was likely to be more persistent than imported inflation. 29 There was more difficulty in estimating the neutral short real rate.  Alternative approaches gave different estimates.  For example, one could use as a guide historical averages of ex post real returns on nominal government bonds, cross-country comparisons, or long-term forward real rates derived from  index-linked gilts.  These gave a range perhaps as wide as 2%–4%. On this basis, estimates of the neutral nominal rate fell in a range of around 41/2% to around 61/2%. 30 While some members of the Committee found the concept of the neutral rate useful in deciding on interest rate policy, other members found the uncertainty surrounding its level so large that the concept was of little use as a practical guide to policy.  Other considerations bearing on the decision this month 31 The Committee noted that much of its concern related to the prospects for consumption growth and confidence.  Since a large share of consumer spending happened around the Christmas period it was possible that a move this month would have a larger effect in supporting activity in the short run than a delayed move, without damaging the prospects for inflation over the medium term. 32 The Committee also discussed the new evidence since the Inflation Report was published.  It was noted that, with the risks on the downside, the mean of the RPIX projection 2 years ahead published in November had already been below 21/2%.  Since then the global situation (including commodity prices) appeared to have weakened further and domestic indicators suggested that the balance of risks to UK activity was even further on the downside,  Inflation Report:  February 1999 68 so that the expected inflation rate two years ahead had fallen since the November Inflation Report. 33 As usual, the Committee considered whether a change in rates would disturb financial markets.  A number of economic commentators were predicting that the Committee would make a cut of 0.25% and many thought a larger cut was warranted.  An immediate cut of 0.50% was within the range of outcomes the market had factored in by the start of the meeting so it was unlikely that a similar size cut would have an unsettling effect.  It was difficult to judge the market consequences of a different decision. The reaction of sterling might depend on whether markets interpreted the change in terms of stronger or weaker prospects for activity growth. The immediate policy decision 34 The Committee concluded that the prospects for global activity and prices had weakened over the month.  Business confidence had been declining across the major economies and commodity prices, particularly oil, had fallen further.  The global financial situation was probably no worse, but UK trade data showed that the effects of slower world demand were beginning to come through on top of the impact of sterling’s appreciation.  The United States and the euro area had both cut rates since the previous MPC meeting.  The main domestic news seemed to be in respect of consumption growth, which had been slower than expected during 1998 as a whole and, on the basis of retail sales growth, was still slowing.  There were a number of possible explanations for this, but none was sufficient on its own. 35 Other indicators of domestic activity also showed a continuing softening.  The CIPS surveys were now indicating negative growth in all the main sectors of the economy.  In contrast, the available data suggested that the labour market remained tight although there were now some signals that the situation might be beginning to ease.  Money growth remained strong and asset prices remained firm.   36 Taking all the news together, the Committee concluded that there was a clear case for a further cut in rates this month.  The question was how much. 37 An argument for a 0.25% cut was identified.  The data might be sufficient to justify a cut of 0.50% but the uncertainty and the remaining upside risks arguably made it slightly preferable to cut by 0.25% this month with another 0.25% to come in January if the analysis was supported by the data. 38 The widely held view was that an immediate cut in rates of 0.50% was justified in terms of incremental news on the month.  In particular the downside risks to both activity and prices appeared to have increased with the unexpected weakness in consumption being a major concern. 39 Some Committee members found it helpful this month to consider where we were in relation to an estimate of the neutral level of nominal rates.  Although subject to a wide range of uncertainty, the neutral rate was likely to be somewhat below the current level of 6.75%.  Therefore a cut of 0.50% this month would be consistent with the news and a step towards neutral. 40 Among those who questioned the practical use of the concept of the neutral rate it was recalled that similar arguments about the level of rates had been used in the mid-eighties to justify lowering rates to levels which subsequently turned out to be too expansionary.  On these grounds one should be cautious about the use of such calculations to justify changes in policy. 41 On another view, a neutral rate would probably be significantly lower than the current rate of 6.75% and the conjuncture indicated that we should be below neutral rather than above.  However, a sequence of cuts would have a greater impact than a single cut of substantially more than 0.50%, which would be seen as an over reaction and might, on this view, be an unnecessary shock to financial markets.  On these grounds an immediate cut of only 0.50% was appropriate. 42 A further view was that there had been a case for cutting by more than 0.50% the previous month and, with the news this month, this suggested that a larger reduction than 0.50% was now appropriate.  Short rates were too high, both in comparison with long rates and compared with short rates in other countries.  On this view, there was no good reason for cutting rates in steps.  The Committee was learning all the time about the response of the economy to shocks and it appeared that the real side of the economy had responded faster to events than the Committee had expected.  On this view there should be an immediate cut of more than 0.50%. 43 The Governor invited members of the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate be cut by 50 basis points to 6.25%.  Eight members of the Committee (the Governor, Mervyn King, David Clementi, Alan Budd, Charles Goodhart, DeAnne Julius, Ian Plenderleith and John Vickers) voted for the proposition.  Willem Buiter voted against, preferring a cut of  75 basis points. 44 The following members of the Committee were present: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Alan Budd Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers 45 Gus O’Donnell was also present as the Treasury representative.  Monetary Policy Committee 69 1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee on 4 December 1998, in advance of its meeting.  At the start of the Committee meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and that information is included in the Annex. I Monetary conditions 2 Notes and coin in circulation had increased by 0.6% in November, after adjusting for the introduction of the new 50 pence and £2 coins.  The twelve-month growth rate had been 5.1%. 3 The twelve-month growth rate of M4 had remained at 9.1% in October and the monthly flow, at £4.9 billion, was close to the average for the first three quarters of 1998.  The entire addition to the stock of M4 had come from the household and Other Financial Corporations (OFC) sectors.  The deposits of Private Non-Financial Corporations (PNFCs) had fallen over the month, by 0.2%. Twelve-month growth rates for the household sector, PNFCs and OFCs had been 5.6%, 5.2% and 22.6% respectively. 4 The one-month growth rate of aggregate M4 lending had remained at 0.7% in October, which pushed the twelve-month change up to 9.1%.  Annual growth in M4 lending to the  household sector had remained unchanged at 7.4% in October. Total secured lending to individuals had continued to grow at an annual rate close to 6%, despite a slowdown in housing market activity;  anecdote suggested that mortgage equity withdrawal might have been a contributory factor.  In contrast, the annual growth in unsecured lending to individuals had remained strong,  at 17.2% in October;  it had been close to this level since the beginning of 1997.  M4 lending to OFCs had increased by 1.3%, raising the annual growth rate to 18.4%.  However, M4 lending  to PNFCs had risen by£0.4 billion, compared with an average  flow of £1.1 billion during the first nine months of the year, reducing the annual growth rate to 5.8%.  PNFCs’ total external finance, which includes foreign currency borrowing and capital issues, remained robust. 5 Net recourse to banks by PNFCs (defined as the difference between M4 lending to PNFCs and their M4 deposits) had also remained strong.  In the year to 1998 Q3, a number of the larger sub-sectors, including manufacturing, had used a greater proportion of the sterling facilities granted to them by banks. 6 Turning to financial prices, it appeared that the 25 basis point cut in official rates in October had already been passed through fully to variable rate mortgages advertised by banks and building societies, and that the 50 basis point cut in official rates in November would, likewise, soon be passed on. 7 Short-term inflation expectations (as surveyed) had remained close to the inflation target, and short-maturity nominal interest rates had fallen.  By implication, there had been a further reduction in short-maturity real interest rates. 8 An empirical analysis of the average real rate earned on a variety of different instruments, in some cases using data back to 1797, suggested a value for the neutral real rate of interest—defined as the rate that would prevail if the economy were at, and set to be at, capacity and inflation was in line with the target—of between 2% and 4%.  Assuming that short-term inflation expectations were close to the inflation target implies a neutral nominal interest rate of between 41/2% and 61/2%. II Demand and output 9 GDP at market prices had grown by 0.4% in 1998 Q3, revised down by 0.1 percentage point from the preliminary estimate, and the annual rate had been revised down to 2.3% from 2.5%.  This was consistent with earlier data on manufacturing output and industrial production, which had pointed to a downward revision.  The expenditure breakdown had shown domestic demand growing by 0.9% in Q3, reflecting a sharp increase in investment. Net trade had made a negative contribution to GDP growth of  0.6 percentage points.  Recent trade data, the scale of the alignment adjustment in the first three quarters of 1998, and the usual revisions reflecting new information had all suggested that the next GDP release could include revisions to the composition of expenditure throughout 1998.  The implications for GDP growth were not clear. 10 Household consumption had remained weak, rising by 0.4%, the same as in Q2.  The Q2 figure had included falls in catering and financial services, which were thought to be erratically weak.  The Q3 release suggested either that the bounceback in these sectors had not been as large as expected, or that other sectors had weakened— so there might have been an underlying slowdown in consumption. Government consumption had risen by 0.6%, compared with 0.9% in the previous quarter. 11 Investment had recovered very strongly following a weak Q2, rising by 2.5% on the quarter.  A fall in manufacturing investment of 4.5% had been more than offset by a rise in service sector investment of 7.4%.  No known erratic components had accounted for the strength of business investment in Q3.  Bank staff had considered whether business surveys might provide an explanation of the current strength of investment, and whether this would be sustained.  Investment intentions did suggest a slightly higher level of investment in Q3, consistent with the provisional estimate.  But the surveys had also suggested the level of investment over the next year would be roughly flat. 12 Inventories had continued to increase in Q3, rising by  £1.7 billion.  There had been a large accumulation of stocks of manufactured finished goods (up £589 million), and retail inventories had risen by more than £250 million for the third successive quarter.  A large increase in stocks of other industries had also pointed towards a significant positive contribution from the alignment adjustment.  Taking the first three quarters of 1998 together, expenditure appeared to have fallen short of output.  Bank calculations suggested that the alignment adjustment had reached around £1.4 billion;  since it must sum to zero over the year, this pointed either to revisions to the first three quarters, or a large negative contribution in Q4.  Looking ahead, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) monthly trends survey had suggested that a stock overhang continued;  the balance reporting excessive stocks was +28 in November.  The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) survey had pointed to falling stocks, though not in the consumer goods sectors. 13 Net trade had made a negative contribution to GDP growth of 0.6% in Q3;  export volumes had fallen by 0.6%, while import volumes had expanded by 1.2%.  But the UK trade data published after the GDP release had pointed to even faster import growth in Q3 (goods volumes had risen by 3.7%), and suggested that a much bigger negative contribution from net trade might be included in the next GDP release (to be published on 21 December).  But this did not necessarily imply a downward revision to Q3 GDP.  In the past year, just under half of the widening of the deficit could be accounted for by a bigger deficit on trade with Asia, including Annex:  Summary of data presented by Bank staff  Inflation Report:  February 1999 70 Japan.  The non-EU trade deficit had narrowed in October, but the trend had remained downward. 14 Manufacturing output had fallen by 0.1% in Q3, while services output had grown by 0.6%, the same as the previous quarter.  Construction output had fallen by 0.7%, owing to a contraction in repairs and maintenance;  new building output had continued to grow.  In October, manufacturing output had contracted by 0.4%—the third consecutive monthly fall.  However, as in the previous few months, industrial production had held up, and was unchanged on the month.  Oil and gas extraction had increased by 0.8%, and utilities supply had remained high, reportedly because of worse-than-usual weather conditions in October. 15 Retail sales volumes had fallen by 0.4% in October, the second consecutive decline.  Survey evidence had continued to point to weaker retail sales.  The CBI Distributive Trades survey had again been weak in November (the balance declined to -9 from -4).  The CBI retailing business confidence indicator had been at its lowest level since the survey began in 1983.  And, the Bank’s regional Agents’ reports suggested falling retail sales turnover in all regions outside Greater London, southern and south east England. At a national level, the Agents’ reports had pointed to an overall fall in turnover in the latest three months.   16 House price inflation had slowed.  The Halifax house price index had risen by 4.9% in the twelve months to November (down from 6.7% in October);  the Nationwide index had risen by 6.9% (down from 7.5% in October);  and the Bank’s index, based on Land Registry data, had declined by 7.5% in the four quarters to Q3, from 8.9% in Q2.  Housing turnover had also slowed— particulars delivered had been 5% lower in October, and the trend had been clearly downwards.  Secured lending had been marginally weaker in October, at £2.1 billion, and the trend in approvals had been downward.  The House Builders’ Federation survey had continued to report negative balances for net reservations (-9) and site visits (-28).   17 The survey evidence had remained weak in November; sentiment towards the domestic outlook had deteriorated further, while export expectations had stabilised somewhat.  The CBI Monthly Industrial Trends survey had reported total orders  balances unchanged at -47, implying a decline in domestic orders, while the balance for export orders improved slightly to -51, from  -55.  Output expectations had improved marginally to -27 in November, from -29 the previous month.  The CIPS manufacturing orders index had reached a record low of 36.4 in November, and its services survey had indicated a contraction in service sector business activity for the first time since the survey began in  July 1996.  III The international economy 18 Economic conditions in Japan had continued to deteriorate. GDP had fallen by 0.7% in Q3 and by 3.6% on a year earlier; however, growth in 1997 had been revised up.  In October, retail sales had fallen 4.8% on a year before, and the unemployment rate had remained at 4.3%.  Reflecting this deteriorating situation, the Japanese government had announced in November a further fiscal package to stimulate domestic demand, reported to include  ¥18 trillion (3.6% of GDP) of extra spending and ¥6 trillion (1.2% of GDP) in tax cuts. 19 In Europe, German GDP had increased by 0.9% in Q3 (2.7% on a year before), and French GDP was up by 0.5% (2.8% on a year before).  In both countries import growth had slowed.  Survey data for the prospective euro area indicated that, between September and October, industrial confidence had fallen from a balance of -2 to -5, while the balance for consumer confidence had picked up from -5 to -3.  Average inflation had remained subdued in October, at 1.0%. 20 In contrast, activity in the United States had generally turned out to be stronger than expected.  The second estimate of Q3 GDP had shown a rise of 1.0% on a quarter ago (revised up from 0.8%). In October, annual M2 money growth had increased to 8.5%, up from 7.9% in September, and retail sales were 5.7% higher than a year ago.  In November, non-farm payrolls had increased by 267,000, well above the average monthly rise of 189,000 in  June-October, and the Conference Board Index of consumer confidence had increased to 126.0, from 119.3 in October. However, annual average hourly wage growth had fallen from 3.8% in October to 3.7% in November, and the twelve-month growth in industrial production had fallen to 2.1% in October—the lowest annual growth rate since the 1991 recession. 21 The OECD, World Bank, and World Trade Organisation (WTO) had all released new forecasts during the month.  In each case projections for world GDP and trade growth in 1998 had been revised down.  World trade growth was expected to slow from 9.5% in 1997 to 5.3% (World Bank), 4.6% (OECD), and 4.5% (WTO).  Thereafter trade growth was expected to increase.  Other forecasters had also revised down output growth projections.  Bank staff had used UK export trade shares to weight together the 1999 GDP growth forecasts, compiled by Consensus Economics Inc., for the major six (M6) economies (US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Canada).  This forecast indicator of M6 GDP growth had fallen from 2.4% in July to 1.9% in November.  On the same basis, consensus forecasts for M6 CPI inflation in 1999 had been revised down from 1.6% to 1.3%. IV Labour market 22 Labour Force Survey (LFS) employment had grown by 124,000 (0.5%) in the three months to September, compared with the previous three months.  This rise was concentrated in full-time employee positions:  full-time employment had increased by 158,000, and the number of employees by 199,000 (0.8%).  In contrast, the number of self-employed workers had fallen by 79,000 (2.4%), and part-time employment dropped by 34,000.  Total hours worked were only 0.1% higher over the quarter, implying that hours per head had fallen by 0.4%.  23 Business surveys had suggested a weaker employment picture than the LFS data.  The composite CIPS measure of employment had shown a sharp deterioration in job growth through 1998 Q3, with the survey indicating falls in overall private sector employment in October and November.  At the sectoral level, the CIPS November survey reported that manufacturing employment had continued to decline sharply, and that construction employment was now starting to fall, whereas services employment had continued to expand, albeit at a markedly slower rate.  This sectoral picture had been broadly corroborated by the reports of the Bank’s regional Agents.  The Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services (FRES) report had shown a modest decline in permanent recruitment business in November, whereas temporary postings had still been rising, although at a slightly slower rate.  It also reported that the availability of staff to take up positions had improved in November. 24 Vacancies at job centres had remained at historically high levels.  Notifications of new vacancies had increased by 14,000 in October, and the stock of unfilled vacancies had risen by 10,000 to a record level.  However, the government’s initiative for job centres to improve the marketing of their services, including the introduction of Saturday opening, may have partly explained these high levels.  National press advertising had also been buoyant, but had shown signs of flattening off in recent months.  25 LFS unemployment had increased by 3,000 in the three months to September, compared with the previous three months. Short-term unemployment (duration under twelve months) had increased by 44,000, but this had been almost entirely offset by a decline in the numbers unemployed for more than one year.  The  Monetary Policy Committee 71 LFS unemployment rate had been unchanged at 6.2%.  LFS figures showed that there had been a fall of 87,000 in the number of economically inactive people in the three months to September, which contrasted with the increases that had been recorded in the first half of the year. 26 Claimant-count unemployment had risen by 7,000 in October, following a revised fall of 4,100 in September.  October’s data had possibly been affected by seasonal adjustment problems following the introduction of the Jobseeker’s Allowance, offsetting the distortion to July’s figures.  Taking this into account, the trend for falling unemployment had probably continued.  Evidence had started to emerge of an impact from the New Deal, as participants had left the Gateway.  There was no firm indication that increased redundancies had yet affected the claimant count.  Inflow rates to the count remained low by historic standards, while LFS data suggested that redundancies during summer 1998 had been at similar levels to the previous two years. 27 Turning to skill shortages, the Bank’s regional Agents had reported some easing of recruitment difficulties, though the level had remained higher than normal, and regional and industrial variations persisted.  Sectoral surveys generally supported this picture.  As well as the CBI manufacturing survey and the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) surveys reported a month ago, the CBI/Price Waterhouse survey had also found some easing in recruitment difficulties in Q3.  However, skills shortages in construction had continued to rise, according to the Confederation of Master Builders survey, and Reed Personnel Services had also reported more severe skill shortages.    28 The rebased earnings data had been suspended by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on 2 November, and were the subject of an independent review.  In October, the Bank’s measure of the whole-economy employment-weighted mean wage settlement (twelve-month moving average) had remained at 3.7% for the sixth consecutive month.  Private sector settlements had been unchanged at 4.0% in October, and public settlements at 3.3%.  Using a matched sample (ie only including firms where data are available for both years), the mean settlement had increased to an annual rate of 3.8% for the four months to October 1998, from 3.4% one year earlier, similar to the pattern in the whole-economy twelve-month measure.  Other evidence suggested that broader earnings pressures may have moderated;  the Reward Index of earnings growth had declined to 5.0% in October, from 5.4% in June, and the Bank’s regional Agents had reported falls in overtime and hours worked, which would lower wage drift. V Prices 29 Commodity prices had fallen again:  the Bank’s sterling  oil-inclusive index had fallen by 15.9% since October 1997, the sharpest annual deflation rate recorded since the index started in January 1992.  Excluding oil, the Bank’s index had fallen by 8.7%. This was broadly in line with the Economist Index in October (in both sterling and dollar terms) which showed that prices had fallen by 16.1% and 17.5% respectively.  The one-month future price of Brent crude had declined by nearly 20% during November, and had reached $9.98 per barrel at the close of business on 9 December. However, RPI petrol prices were unlikely to fall by the same percentage amount, because of the effects of taxes, excise duties and the potential for retailers to widen their margins. 30 Producer prices had also remained weak:  annual input  price inflation had fallen to -9.8% in October, and annual output price inflation, excluding taxes, had reached -0.7%—its lowest  rate on record.  Surveys had suggested that producer price inflation may fall further:  both the CIPS indicator of manufacturing  input prices and the CBI series of output prices reached all-time lows in November.  Annual trade price inflation had remained negative, with export prices to the world unchanged in September, and import prices 0.7% lower (the corresponding figures for  non-EU trade prices in October were -1.1% and -0.7% respectively). 31 Other measures of inflation had also fallen since the November MPC meeting.  Annual inflation, as measured by the retail sales deflator, had fallen to 0.7% in October, its lowest rate since May 1997.  And the annual inflation rate of harmonised consumer prices had fallen by 0.2 percentage points to 1.3%, equalling its lowest rate on record.  The GDP deflator had only increased by 1.8% in the year to the third quarter. 32 RPIX inflation had remained at target for the third consecutive month in October.  Both RPI and RPIY inflation had fallen slightly since September, to 3.1% and 1.8% respectively. RPIY goods inflation had continued to fall, and had become (marginally) negative for the first time in October. VI Financial markets Foreign exchange 33 Sterling and the dollar had strengthened during most of the month, though both had fallen more recently.  Developments in Latin America had been an important influence for the dollar. Looking toward the end of the year, a number of contacts suggested that sterling might be volatile around that time, associated with the move from the ecu to the euro, although there was little sign of this yet. 34 Within Europe, the process of short-term interest rate convergence ahead of the introduction of the euro was almost complete.  The co-ordinated interest rate cut in Europe on  3 December took all prospective euro countries’ short-term interest rates to 3%, except Italy, where the discount rate was reduced to 3.5%. 35 The sterling ERI had appreciated by 0.3% during the month, to 99.6 on 9 December.  It was little changed against the dollar and Deutsche Mark at $1.66 and DM 2.77 respectively.  While some of the news during the month had been negative for sterling (the larger-than-expected repo rate cut;  the release of the MPC minutes; some weaker-than-expected macroeconomic data) the pound had, until recently, appreciated steadily against the Deutsche Mark, supported by merger and acquisition activity.  The path implied by an uncovered interest parity condition under constant UK nominal interest rates was very close to the central projection in the November Inflation Report. Government bond and money markets 36 Short-term interest rate expectations had fallen during the month, particularly in the final few days of November and early December.  The gilt-edged market had been stronger than overseas bond markets, with a sharp fall in gilt yields.  Ten-year gilt redemption yields had fallen by about 55 basis points during the month and, at 4.50%, were now just below those in the United States, though higher than those in Germany (3.77%).  There had been a number of reasons for gilts’ outperformance during the month:  weaker macroeconomic survey data;  the larger-than-expected UK repo rate cut;  the MPC minutes and TSC evidence, which together were interpreted as suggesting greater willingness by MPC to cut rates for a given economic outlook than the market had thought;  and also strong institutional demand for gilts ahead of the payment of gilt coupons on 7 December.  This last factor suggests that the decline in yields was not solely attributable to interest rate expectations. 37 Short-term interest rate expectations, as measured by short sterling futures, had fallen.  Since the November MPC, rate expectations had declined by 22 basis points according to the December 1998 short sterling futures contract.  Further along the curve, expectations had fallen by around 40 basis points.  But rate  Inflation Report:  February 1999 72 expectations for the end of 1999 had risen, owing to concerns about liquidity at the end of that year and in early 2000.  The behaviour of very short-term interest rates suggested that the market expected a cut in the repo rate on 10 December, but this might be exaggerated by year-end demand for gilts on repo. Equity and corporate debt markets 38 Equity prices had initially strengthened in the first half of November but had fallen back toward the end of the month.  Since the previous MPC, the Standard and Poor’s composite share index had reached a new high, but the FT-SE All-Share index had  been unchanged at 2586, with declines again in the General Industrials sector and the Resources sector.  There had been more company profit warnings in November than in the same month a year earlier.  Analysts’ forecasts of corporate earnings growth  for this financial year had been revised down again, to under 1%, but the fall in the risk free real interest rate was an offsetting influence on share prices.  The recent rise in the Japanese equity market probably largely reflected the global recovery in equity markets. 39 In the capital markets, corporate bond yields had fallen during the month over a range of credit ratings, and international bond and syndicated loan issuance by UK corporates had increased since August (usually a quiet month).  UK corporate bond spreads (over the gilt yield curve) had fallen some ten to fifteen basis points across the board.  However, while short maturity sterling swap spreads had also narrowed, ten-year spreads increased by around  13 basis points.  Real yields on UK corporate debt had changed little during the month.  In October, PNFCs total external financing, which measures their new borrowing from all sources and in all currencies, had turned out broadly in line with the average for the past six months. VII Reports by the Bank’s regional Agents 40 The Bank’s regional Agencies had contacted 162 companies from the manufacturing, retail, other services and construction sectors to investigate the reported sharp deterioration in survey measures of business optimism.  They had sought to discover whether the factors that most influenced optimism had been  firm-specific, industry/sector-specific, or related to general economic factors.  This survey had been conducted after the  50 basis point interest rate cut in November.  Nonetheless, the Agents confirmed that overall business optimism had been lower than three months ago;  more than half the manufacturers and retailers, and over a third of the construction and other service sector companies, had been less optimistic.  The survey had found that, independent of a firm’s own performance, companies attached considerable weight to general UK and global economic news when gauging their optimism.  Respondents said the November interest rate cut had positively influenced their optimism, but had been outweighed by other news.  The Agents had reported widespread concern about prospects for global economic growth. However, concern about future demand and output had now become focused more on domestic considerations.   41 The Agents had also reported the results of more general discussions with their contacts.  Economic conditions were largely seen as unchanged from a month earlier.  With the exception of the West Midlands and North East, most respondents felt that talk of a recession had been overdone.  Nevertheless, uncertainty about future prospects had continued to dampen demand.  Although the recent cuts in interest rates had been welcomed, most consumers and firms seemed to be waiting for further reductions before undertaking major purchase and investment decisions. 42 As had been evident in the ONS data, the economic slowdown had not been evenly distributed across industrial sectors. Contacts in the services sector had reported reasonable growth in demand, albeit with some signs of weakness;  retailers generally had only modest expectations for the Christmas period.  Conditions in the manufacturing sector had been widely reported as being difficult, with weak order books for the first half of 1999.  Demand for manufacturing output had fallen, while trading conditions had become more competitive owing to sterling’s appreciation and increased import penetration.  43 The automobile sector had been especially hard hit.  Global oversupply, falling demand for new cars, and the adverse competitiveness effect of sterling’s appreciation had created particularly difficult conditions for UK automobile producers. This, in turn, had reduced demand for the large number of firms who supply parts and services to car manufacturers.  The Agents reported that firms had cut costs in response to these pressures, and that this had included some job losses. 44 Respondents generally had noted that while labour market conditions had remained tight, conditions had begun to ease.  In particular, wage pressures had diminished somewhat, with most wage settlements at, or below, the RPI inflation rate.  Monetary Policy Committee 73 The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee today voted to reduce the Bank’s repo rate by 0.50% to 6.25%. Since the November Inflation Report, the prospect for global activity appears to have weakened and commodity prices have fallen further.  In the UK, GDP growth in the third quarter was revised down, and surveys of activity have continued to indicate a deterioration across the economy, although the labour market is still tight and monetary and financial indicators remain relatively strong.  The Monetary Policy Committee judged that the downside risks to both activity and inflation have increased, and therefore reduced interest rates by 0.50% to keep prospective inflation on track to meet the 2.5% target. The minutes of the meeting will be published at 9.30 am on Wednesday 23 December. Text of Bank of England press notice of 10 December 1998 Bank of England reduces interest rates by 0.50% to 6.25%  Inflation Report:  February 1999 74 Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 6–7 January 1999 1 Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed the prospects for global activity and prices given continued downward revisions to published forecasts; exchange rates and financial markets;  money and credit;  demand and output in the context of the National Accounts revisions;  the labour market;  and other issues including tactics.  The prospects for global activity and prices 2 A key issue remained how much of a depressing influence the international economy would have on the domestic economy, and hence on the prospects for UK inflation.  The outlook for the world economy had clearly deteriorated over recent months, and this had been a material factor in the Committee’s decisions to reduce rates in October, November and December.  Views varied on whether there had been much sign of a further international deterioration over the past month, or whether international developments had principally reflected the continuing pass-through and unwinding of previous negative shocks to demand in the world economy.   3 Some outside forecasts of world trade were being revised down further—for example, the IMF had updated its WEO projections in December.  The latest Consensus Economics survey showed that forecasts for Germany and other euro-area economies had been revised down in December.  Over the past month business confidence in the euro area had continued to weaken.  The Japanese economy continued to deteriorate.  The Tankan survey had weakened further, returning to the very low level recorded in 1994. The latest indicators for the United States continued to be quite strong, and the Consensus Economics survey showed that some growth forecasts for 1999 had been revised up in December.  It was also necessary to take account of the easing of policy in the United States and in the euro area since the autumn and the effects were unlikely to have been seen in the official data yet.  Overall, the situation in the major industrial countries was not obviously worse than a month ago, but was no better than expected.   4 Some of the forward-looking indicators in the United States—such as the National Association of Purchasing Managers index—were a little weaker.  This weakening, in common with that in other OECD countries, perhaps related more to the manufacturing rather than service sectors of the economy.  Though it seemed likely that robust US growth would continue over the next two or three quarters, there was a risk of a substantial slowdown looking further ahead.  One possibility was a weakening of demand, if for example there were an adjustment of equity prices;  another possibility was that supply constraints would begin to slow growth, although there were few signs of that in the current price and cost data.  5 Non-oil commodity prices had risen slightly in November, following the fall in the previous month.  But despite the military action in the Gulf, the fall in world oil prices to around $10 per barrel that had occurred prior to the December meeting had largely persisted.  For the world as a whole there had been a negative shock to aggregate demand following the crisis in East Asia and the Russian financial problems, so that it was likely that demand had fallen further below capacity, putting downward pressure on world prices and possibly real interest rates.  Commodity prices had been especially sensitive to this shock.  For the United Kingdom, goods price inflation excluding taxes was currently running significantly below aggregate RPIX inflation, given falls in the price of tradeables and the effect of past tax increases.  6 The external environment would be a key consideration in the quarterly Inflation Report forecast round.  The risks to both inflation and real activity remained clearly on the downside, and might have increased.  The Committee discussed the risks and possible ramifications of further serious problems in emerging market economies, and agreed that policy could react if these downside risks materialised. Exchange rates and financial markets 7 The sterling effective exchange rate had appreciated a little prior to Christmas, but had depreciated slightly at the turn of the year.  The Bank had monitored the introduction of the euro, which had gone smoothly, and the Committee agreed that this did not, for the time being, have any material implications for the outlook for inflation and the conduct of monetary policy in the United Kingdom. 8 The yield on index-linked government debt had continued to fall, and was now around 2% at a maturity of ten years.  Real yields were now at their lowest level since such bonds were introduced in the United Kingdom in 1981.  Regulatory changes for pension funds that came into force in April 1997—namely the minimum funding requirement—may have made it more attractive for them to hold index-linked debt relative to some other assets.  But the effects of these changes were likely to be spread over a number of years following the initial announcement, and it seemed unlikely that this could explain the very recent fall in UK real yields.  There had been a corresponding fall in long-term nominal yields:  implied inflation expectations remained broadly unchanged over the recent past.  It was not clear what had caused the fall in UK long-term real interest rates, and therefore what the consequences would be for the economy.  Although it was difficult to explain the fall in long-term real yields in the United Kingdom relative to overseas, it was noted that there had been a general decline in global real yields over the past year.  One possible explanation of the most recent fall was linked to the downward shock to world demand, which might imply a reduction in the real rate of interest that would balance global saving and investment. 9 Most major international stock markets had risen over the past month, and the FT-SE All-Share index was 13% above the level assumed in the November Inflation Report central projection.  It was difficult to explain fully the rise in equity prices, but it was possible that it was related to the fall in real interest rates. 10 The spreads of yields on UK corporate bonds over government bond yields remained higher than they had been prior to the shocks of summer 1998.  But the level of nominal yields on these bonds had fallen over the same period.   Money and credit 11 The growth rate of notes and coin had been robust through the autumn, even after adjusting for the introduction of the £2 coin. This added weight to the picture painted by the official retail sales figures, which had been stronger than much of the survey evidence had suggested.  The provisional December figure for notes and coin had been particularly strong, but this could not sensibly be assessed in isolation because of the uncertainty surrounding the seasonal adjustment to the Christmas month figures. 12 Aggregate M4 growth had slowed in November, and had been matched by slower growth of lending.  The slowdown in the growth of M4 and M4 lending was in large part accounted for by a reduction in the stocks of deposits and outstanding loans held by other financial corporations (OFCs).  Within OFCs there had been anecdotal evidence that securities dealers, in particular, had been contracting their balance sheets by more than normal towards the  Monetary Policy Committee 75 end of 1998.  This was consistent with some of the data (for example, the fall in sterling lending by the major British banks to securities dealers).   13 Overall, some members thought that the latest monetary data were consistent with a gradual slowing of demand. 14 Lending to households continued to be robust, and had grown by 71/2% in the year to November.  This did not seem to be significantly out of line with nominal consumption growth. However, the high rate of increase in the smaller non-secured component of lending (which accounted for around 20% of the stock) continued to be puzzling. 15 Bank lending to companies had continued to grow steadily. Bond issuance had been low at the end of 1998.  But it usually was at that time of year, so underlying conditions were difficult to assess.  The number of insolvencies had risen but from a relatively low level.  The Committee concluded, as in previous months, that recent indicators did not suggest a material impairment of the supply of credit. Demand and output 16 Although there had been no change to the estimate of GDP growth in the third quarter of 1998, there had been revisions both to the composition of GDP growth in Q3, and to its rate of growth in earlier quarters.  The level of output was now around 0.2% lower than previously estimated, so pressure on capacity was likely to have been a little less than previously thought, all other things being equal.  The three measures of GDP—income, expenditure and output—were diverging and that made it more difficult to judge the pace at which the economy was growing.  Within the Q3 GDP figures, growth of final domestic demand had been revised down and the contribution from net trade and inventory building had been revised up.  In particular, consumption growth had been revised down, and the pattern was of a more gradual slowdown over the past year than had previously been estimated.  Consumer confidence remained weak. 17 With the exception of the mortgage lending figures, the indicators suggested that housing market activity was slowing. Particulars delivered were now quite low compared with the past. The Halifax house price index had recorded a fall in prices for the second successive month.  One view was that this provided further evidence of a loss of consumer confidence over the summer. However, the housing market was sensitive to interest rates, so a degree of slowing was to be expected following the tightening of monetary policy through 1997 and the first half of 1998.  And members agreed that the relatively moderate rate of house price inflation over the past year was a welcome sign of greater stability than in past cycles. 18 The contribution of stockbuilding to GDP growth had been revised up in the third quarter of 1998, but there had been a downward revision to stock levels.  In particular, stocks of finished manufactures had been revised down significantly.  However, there seemed to be little news overall in the revisions to aggregate inventories, some of which reflected statistical changes in the National Accounts.  Nonetheless, the balance of risks remained that the build up in inventories would be unwound by more than expected.  19 The CBI Distributive Trades survey for December was less weak than the previous month’s survey, but this news was probably offset by the weaker CIPS services survey.  It was too soon to glean any reliable impression of the state of consumer spending over the Christmas/New Year period.  Overall, the latest evidence from surveys and monthly indicators did not suggest that the latest best estimate for GDP growth in the fourth quarter was very different from that in the central projection in the November Inflation Report. Labour market 20 The labour market data continued to show rising employment and falling inactivity.  But there were now further indications that unemployment was probably no longer falling.  The recent data had shown a fall in long-term unemployment more than offset by a rise in short-term unemployment.  The three CIPS surveys for manufacturing, services and construction were now all pointing to falling employment.    21 The number of jobs recorded by the ONS Workforce survey had been revised up by 450,000 implying lower productivity and higher unit labour costs data.  The Committee noted that its November Inflation Report projections had been based on the Labour Force Survey measure of employment, which was not affected by this revision. 22 The Committee thought that the labour market remained tight, but that it seemed to have reached a turning point, and there were some signs of an easing of labour market pressures from the indicators of skill shortages and signs on pay settlements.  The twelve-month employment-weighted average of pay settlements had been flat for many months and, depending on wage drift, this suggested a somewhat more benign path for earnings growth than had been expected around six months ago given the apparent tightening of the labour market.  The Bank’s regional Agents had reported some easing of upward pressure on pay growth.  The current level of settlements was not especially comforting given the normal level of pay drift, but with the economy slowing members thought that there should be reduced pressure on pay from this source.  And the reduction in interest rates over recent months would tend to lower RPI inflation relative to the target measure of RPIX in the short-term, which might influence settlements in coming months.  Inflation expectations were important for wage setting, and had fallen in the latest surveys.  These expectations might also be better anchored, following the monetary policy regime change, than had been the case in the past. 23 According to the National Accounts estimate of wages and salaries per head, nominal growth had fallen to 4.4% in the year to Q3.  Estimates of the real wage paid by producers—based on the GDP deflator at basic prices—showed that the rate of growth was still rising, and was consistent with past tightening of the labour market.  However, the rate of increase of the real wage received  by workers had been decreasing during 1998.  The wedge of over two percentage points between the two measures could be explained by past increases in taxes and changes in employers’ contributions. 24 The Committee noted that their assumption for earnings growth in 1999 used in the November Inflation Report central projection was towards the top end of the range of outside forecasts made in November and December, and agreed that it would return to the issue in its discussion of the forecast for the February Inflation Report. Other considerations bearing on the decision this month 25 There were a number of reasons for expecting significant news over the next month.  A large share of consumer spending happened around the Christmas period, and at the time of the January meeting the official estimate of retail sales in December was not available.  But given the difficulty in seasonally adjusting the data at this time of the year, it would be some time before the full picture became clear.  The first estimate of Q4 GDP would also become available by the time of the February meeting.  In addition, it would be possible to observe the first settlements relating to January, which is an important month for pay agreements. Furthermore, it was still early to assess the impact of the introduction of the euro.   Inflation Report:  February 1999 76 The immediate policy decision 26 The Committee concluded that the prospects for global activity and prices were as bad as expected a month ago, and that the risks remained clearly on the downside.  Some Committee members thought that these risks had increased somewhat in the past month, and that it seemed likely that the adjustment of the world economy to past demand shocks would prove more prolonged than some forecasts currently assumed. 27 The main domestic news on the real side of the economy had been the small downward revision to the level of GDP and the change in the composition of GDP growth, especially the downward revision to consumption.  On the other hand the recent news on retail sales was mixed, while the data on notes and coin, and world stock markets pointed to a stronger outlook for activity. And some of the surveys were perhaps not as weak as they had been a month ago.  Nonetheless, recent indicators suggested that GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 1998 would turn out broadly as expected at the time of the November Report.  The labour market remained tight, but seemed to have reached a turning point. 28 Given the picture for activity, nominal price and cost developments continued to be more benign than expected at the time of the November projections and, on the view of some members, than expected in December.  The fall in the oil price in November had largely persisted through December.  Producer input prices had continued to fall.  Evidence from wage settlements and the Bank’s regional Agents suggested an easing of upward pressures on the rate of increase of pay. 29 On one view, given that there was not much news on the month, there was merit in waiting to gather another month’s evidence and for the quarterly Inflation Report.  The coming month would see some important data on Q4 GDP and settlements, and it was possible that the outcome of the Average Earnings Index review would be known.  There were just enough signs of continuing demand growth in the recent data for the next month’s data to be important to the policy decision.  The quarterly forecasting round would provide an opportunity to reassess the level of interest rates.  On balance, there was a case for pausing and making no change in interest rates this month.  If in the event the evidence warranted it, a larger reduction in rates could be made next month. 30 Members identified several possible reasons for an immediate reduction in rates.  The adjustment in the world economy was likely to prove more prolonged than previously assumed, with external demand for UK goods and services through 2000 correspondingly weaker.  If so, there was less need for policy to put downward pressure on domestically generated inflation.  In addition, the November Inflation Report central projection had also assumed robust real earnings growth and consumption.  The revisions to the expenditure composition of domestic demand, together with the potential easing in the labour market and the apparent moderation of inflation expectations, suggested that the prospects for inflation looked weaker.  A combination of these external and domestic factors suggested that a reduction in rates of 0.25% (or possibly more in the view of some) was now warranted. If a reduction of 0.25% to interest rates were made at the January meeting it was difficult to see that being inappropriate by the time of the February meeting.  The probability of a reversal in rates seemed small, and reversals justified by economic news were anyway not problematic. 31 Another view was that a cut of 0.75% would have been preferable at the time of the December meeting on the basis of the news available then.  With little, if any, news during the past month, a reduction of 0.25% was still needed, and should be made now. 32 Another view was that a reduction of 0.25% would still leave rates above their neutral level, which was too high in the context of the current conjuncture.  So the issue was how fast to reduce rates. There were three reasons for moving in steps rather than in one large reduction.  First, a series of reductions might have a greater impact on consumer and business sentiment.  Second, it might allow the Committee to learn more about the way the economy was responding to past shocks and policy changes.  Third, it was important not to out-pace significantly the expectations of financial markets, as this could have unwanted consequences for asset prices and the exchange rate.  Even though it was appropriate to move in a series of steps, the current level of rates was sufficiently above the rate required at this point in the cycle that a reduction of 0.50% was needed now. 33 The Governor invited members of the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate be cut by 0.25% to 6.0%. Seven members of the Committee (the Governor, Mervyn King, David Clementi, Alan Budd, Willem Buiter, Charles Goodhart and John Vickers) voted for the proposition, and two (DeAnne Julius and Ian Plenderleith) voted against.  DeAnne Julius preferred an immediate cut of 0.50%, and Ian Plenderleith preferred to maintain the Bank’s repo rate at 6.25%. 34 The following members of the Committee were present: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Alan Budd Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers 35 Gus O’Donnell was present as the Treasury representative.  Monetary Policy Committee 77 1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by the Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee on 4 January 1999, in advance of its meeting on 6 January 1999.  At the start of the Committee meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and that information is included in the Annex. I Monetary conditions 2 Notes and coin had risen in December by 1.2%.  The  twelve-month growth rate had increased by 0.6 percentage points to 5.7%.  Seasonal factors were typically harder to establish in the Christmas period, making the December data especially hard to interpret. 3 The monthly flow of M4 in November, at £2.1 billion, was well below the average over the rest of 1998, and the twelve-month growth rate had fallen to 8.3%, the lowest since July 1995.  This was largely accounted for by a £0.7 billion decline in Other Financial Corporations’ (OFCs’) balances in November and a slightly lower rate of increase of Household sector deposits.  The deposits of Private Non-Financial Corporations (PNFCs) had risen strongly in November, following a small fall in October.  Taking the two months together, PNFCs’ deposits in October and November were in line with the 1998 average.  4 The increase of £1.8 billion in M4 lending in November was the lowest since December 1996.  The sectoral pattern largely mirrored that on the deposits side:  OFCs had made a net repayment of £4.0 billion in November while PNFCs borrowing had increased quite sharply, to £1.9 billion.  Anecdotal evidence suggested that the OFC sector may have chosen to shrink balance sheets by more than has been typical ahead of the year-end.  Major British Banks’ lending to securities dealers had fallen by £1.5 billion in November, consistent with that interpretation. 5 Households’ borrowing had remained steady in November at £3.0 billion, and the twelve-month growth rate was still 7.4%, around 0.5 percentage points higher than at the start of 1998.  There had been no slowdown on the month in secured borrowing or the number of loan approvals for house purchase.  Unsecured credit growth had remained strong:  the comprehensive measure of unsecured credit, which includes lending by non-M4 institutions, had increased by 17.3% on a year earlier. 6 Net external finance raised by PNFCs had risen by £1.4 billion to £4.4 billion in November.  This included an increase in PNFCs net recourse to banks and a reduction in net capital issues. As for capital market conditions, the spread between swaps and government debt, and between corporate bonds and government debt, had both been broadly constant during December.  These spreads remained high by historic standards but were below the peaks observed in the autumn. 7 Turning to price indicators of monetary conditions, the  50 basis point cut in official rates in November had already been fully passed through to variable-rate mortgages advertised by banks and building societies;  announcements had been made by lenders that the 50 basis point cut in official rates in December would soon be passed on. 8 Survey measures of short-run inflation expectations had fallen by between 10 and 20 basis points during November, lying largely in a range between 2.2%–2.3%.  These surveys had predominantly been undertaken before the reduction in official interest rates on 10 December.  Measures of professionals’ expectations of average annual inflation over the next two years, derived from Consensus Economics and Basix surveys, had fallen by between 25 and 50 basis points on a quarter earlier.  Estimates of short real interest rates could be made by subtracting survey measures of inflation expectations from a corresponding maturity wholesale money market rate.  These calculations suggested that short real rates had fallen again during November, by around  20 basis points.  Estimates of average real interest rates over the next two years derived from the Consensus survey enabled international comparisons to be made;  they suggested that over Q4 real rates had fallen by substantially more in the United Kingdom (around 60 basis points) compared with either the United States (around 15 basis point fall) or Germany (around 30 basis point fall). 9 The Basix general public’s inflation expectations for the next two years had also fallen markedly over Q4.  The mean inflation expectations for one year ahead had fallen from 4.5% to 4.2% over the quarter.  Expected inflation two years ahead had fallen from 5.1% to 4.7% over the quarter.  There had also been a shift in the distribution of inflation expectations away from 4% or above, to 3% or below.  The expectations of inflation formed by the general public still remained well above other measures. II Demand and output 10 According to the National Accounts release, GDP at market prices had grown by an unrevised 0.4% in 1998 Q3 on a quarter earlier, and by 2.3% at an annual rate.  But downward revisions to growth in 1997 and the first half of 1998 had reduced the level of GDP by around £350 million (or 0.2%).  There had been revisions to the expenditure composition of growth in Q3, with a slightly stronger contribution from net trade offsetting weaker domestic demand.  And the divergence between the output and expenditure measures of GDP had widened markedly to £865 million, compared with almost zero in 1997 Q3. 11 Household consumption growth in Q3 had been revised down from 0.4% to 0.3%.  Within this, service sector spending had grown by 1.4%, but expenditure on both non-durable and durable goods had fallen.  Analysis by Bank staff suggested that part of the recent decline in durables spending might reflect the unwinding of unusually high spending in 1997 and the start of 1998.  This high spending had perhaps been caused by building society windfalls, though this effect appeared to have been rather smaller than expected and had been contrasted with a marked weakening in the growth of consumption of non-durables since 1996. 12 Investment growth in Q3 had been revised down from 2.5% to 1.1%, but the level of investment had been revised up by 0.6%, reflecting new information about investment in previous quarters. (Business investment had been revised up by 2.8%).  These upwards revisions had been concentrated in the private services sectors, and mainly reflected increased spending on machinery and equipment. 13 A rise in inventories—most marked in the manufacturing and retail sectors—had contributed 0.2% to GDP growth in Q3. But the cumulative increase in stocks through 1998 as a whole had been revised down by around £1.8 billion.  It was possible that there was now less of an overhang in stocks than previously thought.  But interpretation was complicated by the fact that the reduction had largely reflected a reallocation out of the alignment adjustment and into the statistical discrepancy.  Evidence from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) monthly Industrial Trends survey suggested that manufacturers’ stocks had risen further above desired levels in Q4. Annex:  Summary of data presented by Bank staff  Inflation Report:  February 1999 78 14 Government consumption growth had been revised down by 0.4 percentage points in Q3 to 0.2% and by 0.5 percentage points in Q2 to 0.4%. 15 The current account had been in surplus by £2.3 billion in Q3, but this was accounted for by a large surplus on investment income, reflecting losses on overseas investments by foreign-owned financial institutions based in the United Kingdom.  Net trade had continued to deteriorate, making a -0.5 percentage point contribution to GDP growth in Q3 (revised up slightly from  -0.6 percentage points).  This fourth consecutive quarterly negative contribution had reflected a rise in the deficit on trade in goods to the highest level since 1990 Q2.  Trade in services had continued to provide a small positive contribution to GDP growth, despite a fall in services exports, as lower spending abroad by UK residents had reduced services imports.  Net trade in goods appeared to have weakened further in Q4:  exports to the non-EU had fallen by 1.9% in November and imports had risen by 2.2%.  But the deficit with the EU had remained broadly stable. 16 Retail sales had risen by 0.8% in November, in contrast to the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and CBI Distributive Trades surveys which had indicated a continuing decline.  Part of the difference might be explained by the broader sample used by the ONS.  On an annual basis, comparing the three months to November with the same period a year ago, retail sales had grown by 2.6%, closer to the BRC’s total sales volume measure, but still rather stronger than the CBI survey.  Consumer confidence had remained weak:  the GfK index had fallen back in December from  -5.8% to -6.9%, and the MORI balance had been -30 in November. Most indicators had suggested a continued moderation in the housing market.  Compared with a year earlier, the Nationwide house price index had grown by 7% in December;  and the Halifax index had grown by 4.6%;  particulars delivered had fallen to 103,000 in November—the lowest for over two years—and the House Builders Federation survey of new house building had remained weak. 17 Manufacturing output had fallen by 0.4% in October, the third consecutive monthly fall.  Lower demand in domestic markets had appeared to be the main reason for lower car production and engineering new orders.  Both the CBI and British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) surveys had pointed to a fall in manufacturing output in Q4 as a whole.  But there was some evidence from the CBI and Chartered Institute of Purchasing Supply (CIPS) surveys that the pace of decline had bottomed out.  Growth rates derived from the BCC survey for Q3 suggested that service sector output had grown at around trend in Q4, but the CIPS survey had pointed to a fall in service sector activity in December for the second consecutive month. III The labour market 18 Both of the ONS measures of employment had increased according to the latest data.  LFS employment had increased by 80,000 (0.3%) in the three months to October compared with the previous three months, while the Workforce jobs measure had bounced back in Q3, rising by 97,000 (0.4%) after a fall in Q2.   The two measures were consistent in showing employment growth of around 1% over the past year.  And, as over the previous year, the rise in Workforce jobs in Q3 was accounted for by a strong  rise in employees, partly offset by a fall in the number of  self-employed.  By industry, the recent rise in employee jobs had  been in the services and construction sectors, partly offset by falls in manufacturing and in the other sectors.  Within services, industries which had experienced strong employment growth  over the past year included distribution, hotels and restaurants; finance;  and transport and communications.  Within manufacturing, more than half the net loss in jobs over the past year had been in textiles, although recent falls in employment had been more evenly spread. 19 Revisions to the Workforce jobs data in the latest release had increased the level of employee jobs by around 430,000 in September 1997, and had increased the rate of employment growth during 1997.  These changes, along with GDP revisions, had reduced productivity growth since 1997.  Productivity had grown by 1.6% over the year to 1998 Q3. 20 Turning to other measures of employment demand, LFS total hours worked had increased by 0.3% in August-October, although there had been no change in average hours per worker.  The CIPS employment surveys had reported sharp falls in employment in both construction and manufacturing in December.  Service sector employment had edged down for the first time since the survey began in 1996.  The Manpower survey of employment intentions had shown a sharp deterioration looking ahead to 1999 Q1.  The net balance was at its lowest for 5 years, though after seasonal adjustment by Bank staff it remained around its historical average since 1981. 21 Notifications of new vacancies had fallen by 13,000 in November, although they remained high.  The stock of unfilled vacancies had increased by 4,000 to a new record.  But press advertising had shown a slightly weaker picture, with National Press Recruitment Advertising index beginning to turn down, according to the Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services survey.  And reports from the Bank’s regional Agents suggested that there had been a downturn in local press advertising in recent months. 22 Both LFS unemployment and claimant unemployment had started to rise according to the latest data.  LFS unemployment increased by 16,000, though the rate remained unchanged at 6.2%. Within that rise, the number unemployed for less than one year had risen by 38,000, partly offset by a 21,000 fall in the long-term unemployed.  Claimant unemployment had risen by 6,000 in November, and unlike October’s data, there were no special factors to explain the rise.  The rises in claimant unemployment had mainly been in the regions with higher unemployment rates.  Inflows into the claimant count had increased by 9,000 in November, although they remained low by historical standards. 23 The rise in both LFS employment and unemployment was reconciled by a fall in inactivity.  This fall was concentrated entirely among those not wanting a job, suggesting a slight increase in labour market attachment. 24 There were no new ONS earnings data, the Average Earnings Index having been suspended in November.  The Reward index suggested that earnings growth had slowed a little in November to 4.9%. 25 Turning to settlements, the Bank’s measure of the  twelve-month employment weighted mean wage settlement had remained at 3.7% for the seventh successive month in November. But most settlements were concentrated between January and April, so the twelve-month measure tended to be relatively stable during other periods.  Private and public sector settlements were unchanged at 4.0% and 3.3% respectively.  The three-month employment-weighted mean settlement increased from 3.7% to 3.9%, while the median was unchanged at 4.0%.  Using a matched sample (ie only including firms where data were available for both years) suggested that settlements had been higher in the five months to November 1998 than in the previous year.  74% of employees covered by the Bank’s database (and 55% of firms) awarded higher settlements in 1998 than in 1997.  On a sectoral basis, 77% of service sector employees had received higher settlements in 1998, compared with just 43% in the production sector. 26 In the absence of average earnings data, the ONS had used other sources of data to estimate the growth in wages and salaries for the National Accounts.  The ONS suggested that wages and  Monetary Policy Committee 79 salaries per head had increased by 4.4% in Q3, and growth in Q2 was revised down from 5.6% to 5.1%.  Despite this, unit wage  cost growth was revised up in the year to 1998 Q1 because of changes to the productivity data.  The ONS estimated that unit wage costs had risen by 3.5% in the year to Q2 and by 2.8% in the year to Q3. 27 Real consumption wages had grown by 1% in the year to Q3 because the taxes and prices index (TPI) had risen by over 3%. Real product wages, on the other hand, had grown more strongly, by 3.4%.  Real product wages are deflated by the GDP deflator (at basic prices), which had grown less strongly than the TPI, explaining the large difference. IV Agents’ national summary 28 The Bank’s regional Agents reported on their assessment of the economy drawn from their discussions with contacts over the past month.  The slowdown in activity had become more widespread.  The fall in manufacturing output and orders had persisted;  domestic demand in particular had weakened and import competition had strengthened.  But the decline in export demand had begun to ease somewhat.  Service sector growth had continued to slow, with a significant fall in demand from manufacturers. Consumer demand had weakened:  inward tourism demand in 1999 was expected to be below that of 1998.  However, telecoms and IT firms had reported strong growth and warehouse activity reflected the high stock levels.  Manufacturers had reported high levels of unwanted stocks of finished goods and some had extended their Christmas stoppages to help unwind that position.  The growth in the official retail sales data in November contrasted with reports from Agents’ retailing contacts, which suggested that there had been sluggish sales growth, more in line with the CBI Distributive Trades survey.  Sales growth in the first half of December had also been weak but there had been a noticeable pick-up in the week before Christmas.  Price discounting in December had been greater than in 1997. 29 Upward pressure on wages had continued to ease.  Even sectors of previously intense pressure (such as IT) had reported some easing.  An increasing emphasis on job security had lowered wage expectations.  The Working Time Directive would increase firms’ costs not only through increased paid holiday provision and lost shift flexibility, but also via increased administration and monitoring.  A number of contacts had sought opt-out agreements with their staff.  Employment growth had continued, albeit more slowly, in the service sector, which contrasted with the decline in the November CIPS survey.  Nonetheless, overall unemployment was expected to rise in 1999 as service sector growth would no longer balance job losses in manufacturing. V International environment 30 Evidence from the United States had remained mixed.  GDP growth in Q3 had been revised down slightly, to +0.9%, reflecting weaker net exports.  Industrial production had continued to weaken, growing by 1.5% in the year to November.  Consumer confidence had remained strong in November, but optimism about future employment and incomes had fallen.  Non-farm payrolls had also continued to grow strongly in November, but this was due to seasonal effects, and the annual growth rate had been slowing since August.  Nominal retail sales had grown by 0.6% in November, but real personal consumption had remained unchanged.  M2 increased 8.8% in the year to November. 31 There were few signs that activity had bottomed-out in Japan.  The December Tankan survey had been weak:  the balance for large manufacturers had been recorded at -56 and was now back to February 1994’s low point.  The balance of firms with above-desired levels of employees continued to increase.  The average propensity to consume had fallen in November, and retail sales had fallen 1.5% on a year earlier (the seventh consecutive month of annual decline).  The Tankan survey showed that corporate financial conditions had continued to deteriorate and that banks remained unwilling to lend (confirmed by official data which showed that bank lending had fallen 4.0% on a year earlier in November, although this may have been overstated as a result of debt write-offs).  There was little evidence of fiscal policy supporting public construction orders—these had fallen 14.7% on a year earlier. 32 The quarterly growth rate of the EU5 (France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain) had remained broadly unchanged in Q3.  Private consumption had held up in Germany, France and Italy.  While net trade had contributed positively to GDP growth, largely reflecting weaker import growth, this had been offset by weaker stockbuilding.  In Q4, industrial confidence had continued to weaken, the annual rate of industrial production growth had continued to slow, and euro area capacity utilisation had fallen  for the first time since 1997 Q1.  Against this, consumer  confidence had continued to strengthen in November.  Inflation had remained weak (0.9% on the harmonised measure), and growth of the ECB’s new euro area M3 measure had been close to the reference rate. 33 December Consensus Economics forecasts for 1999, were stronger for the United States, unchanged for Japan, and had been revised down for Germany, France and Italy. 34 Between October and December, the IMF had revised down its 1999 GDP forecasts, most significantly for Japan.  World trade forecasts had also been revised down slightly. VI Prices 35 The Bank’s index of commodity prices excluding oil had risen by 0.8% in November, the biggest monthly rise since June 1997.  The annual rate of inflation had risen to -6.7% in November from -9.2%.  But the suggestion that non-oil commodity price deflation had started to abate had not been supported by the most recent three-month-on-three-month data:  at -3.2% the rate of deflation had been the strongest since January.  And commodity prices including oil continued to fall, by 1.1% in November according to the Bank’s index. 36 Oil prices had stabilised in December following the sharp fall during November.  Despite a brief increase at the beginning of the air strikes against Iraq, the one-month future price of Brent crude oil had risen to $10.53 by the end of December from $10.46 at the beginning.  The effect on the UK real economy of low oil prices was likely to be small relative to the mid 1980s as oil’s share of output, profits and net exports had declined significantly.  And the effect on retail prices inflation had continued to be more than offset by taxes and excise duties.  The rate of fuel price inflation in the United Kingdom had been the highest of any EU country in October. 37 Producer prices had fallen again in November:  input prices had fallen by 0.6%, as in October, and output prices (excluding excise duties) had fallen by 0.1%.  The CIPS and CBI surveys had suggested further falls in December.   38 Other measures of inflation had remained almost unchanged since the December MPC meeting.  Annual retail sales deflator inflation had remained at 0.9% in November.  The GDP at market prices deflator had increased by 1.8% in the year to the third quarter. 39 RPIX inflation had remained equal to the target for the fourth consecutive month in November;  RPIY inflation had remained at 1.8%.  RPI inflation had fallen by 0.1 percentage points since October, to 3.0%.  Goods price inflation had remained much lower than that in services:  RPIY goods inflation had remained just below zero in November.  Inflation Report:  February 1999 80 VII Information from financial markets Foreign exchange 40 Since the previous MPC meeting, the dollar had weakened by about 4.4% against the yen.  The dollar had remained fairly constant against the Deutsche Mark, with a temporary weakness within the month around the time of developments in the Clinton impeachment case.  Contrary to market expectations sterling had initially moved higher against both the dollar and the Deutsche Mark before falling back in the last few days.  Since 29 December the sterling ERI had fallen by around 2%, returning it to the levels prevailing at the previous MPC meeting. 41 The transition to the euro had been smooth.  In its first 24 hours of trading, the euro had appreciated against most other currencies, including sterling. Government bond and money markets 42 Since the previous MPC meeting, the short-term interest rates implied by short sterling futures contracts had fallen further, and indicated that the current interest rate cycle was expected to bottom out in June 2000.  New economic data had had little impact on expectations.  The implied two-week repo rate two weeks forward was 14 basis points below the prevailing two-week repo rate.  This was consistent with anecdotes suggesting that the market believed there was an evens chance of a 25 basis point cut in rates this month. 43 Euro-area rates had fallen, while United States rates had mainly risen.  United Kingdom rates were close to short dollar rates from December 2000 onwards. 44 There had been a large rise in Japanese bond yields of around 80 basis points over the month.  Market commentators had suggested that this was associated with an announcement that government trust funds would not buy a material amount of bonds in the current year, when bond issuance is set to rise. 45 United Kingdom yields at medium maturities were around  45 basis points below those in the United States, and some 60 basis points above those in Germany and France.  In forward rate terms, this meant that United Kingdom yields beyond 5 years were now below German levels. 46 The United Kingdom had experienced a decline in  index-linked government bond yields that had not been shared with other countries.  This was sufficient to explain the fall in nominal yields, especially at the long end, but was not itself easily explained. Equity and corporate debt markets 47 Most equity markets had risen since the last MPC.  The US market was 7% above the July pre-crisis peak.  The Japanese market had fallen a further 10%.  The rise in the UK market had been broadly based, possibly reflecting lower real interest rates. 48 Analysts’ forecasts of the growth in earnings per share for FT-SE 100 companies for the current financial year had continued to be revised downwards, and the median forecast had become negative.  The path of revisions seen during 1998 was much sharper than since 1992. 49 The number of profit warnings was running at a higher level than last year.  Fewer companies were citing the level of sterling as a cause of the lower profits, but more were citing weak domestic demand. 50 The level of equity market uncertainty, as measured by implied volatility, was slightly down since the previous MPC meeting, but was still higher than before the recent turbulence.   51 There had been little movement in credit spreads in the United Kingdom or the United States.  The yield spread of an index of UK bank bonds over high-rated corporates had remained at a high level, possibly reflecting greater uncertainty over the outlook for banks since the Russian crisis.  Monetary Policy Committee 81 The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee today voted to reduce the Bank’s repo rate by 0.5% to 5.5%. Taking account, in particular, of the prospects for international activity and prices, domestic costs and consumer demand, the Committee’s latest inflation projections implied that a further reduction in interest rates was necessary to keep inflation on a path consistent with the target of 21/2%.  The latest projections and analysis will appear in the Inflation Report to be published on Wednesday 10 February. The minutes of the meeting will be published at 9.30 am on Wednesday 17 February. Text of Bank of England press notice of 5 February 1999 Bank of England reduces interest rates by 0.5% to 5.5%  Text of Bank of England press notice of 7 January 1999 Bank of England reduces interest rates by 0.25% to 6% The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee today voted to reduce the Bank’s repo rate by 0.25% to 6.0%. Since the Committee’s December meeting, domestic data and survey evidence have, on balance, shown a continuing slowdown in the UK economy.  The labour market remains tight but it seems to have reached a turning point.  Evidence from wage settlements and the Bank’s regional Agents suggest an easing of upward pressures on growth in pay.  The risks from the international environment remain clearly on the downside.  In these circumstances the Committee judged that a further reduction in interest rates of 0.25% to 6.0% was appropriate in order to maintain a path for inflation consistent with the target. The minutes of the meeting will be published at 9.30 am on Wednesday 20 January.  Glossary and other information Glossary of selected data AEI: Average Earnings Index.

1999-05-12,"Inflation Report May 1999 The Inflation Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff  under the guidance of the members of the Monetary  Policy Committee.  It serves two purposes.  First,  its preparation provides a comprehensive and  forward-looking framework for discussion among MPC  members as an aid to our decision making.  Second, its  publication allows us to share our thinking and explain  the reasons for our decisions to those whom they affect. Although not every member will agree with every  assumption on which our projections are based, the fan  charts represent the MPC’s best collective judgment  about the most likely path for inflation and output, and the  uncertainties surrounding those central projections. This Report has been prepared and published by the  Bank of England in accordance with section 18 of the  Bank of England Act 1998. The Monetary Policy Committee: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Alan Budd Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers The Overview of this Inflation Report is available on the Bank’s web site:   www.bankofengland.co.uk/infrep.htm.

Printed by Park Communications Ltd © Bank of England 1999 ISBN 1 85730 117 X ISSN 1353–6737  i Overview Prospects for the world economy, which deteriorated sharply in the second half of last year, have improved in recent months.  But the immediate outlook is for modest growth of world output and trade.  The expected slowdown in UK growth has occurred.  Forward-looking survey measures, some of which had fallen precipitously, have now recovered to levels consistent with a pick-up in growth.  Inflation on the RPIX measure has remained close to 2.5%, and future inflation expectations appear reasonably well anchored to the inflation target.  Sterling has risen strongly, in particular relative to the euro, over the past three months. In the world economy, the remarkable growth of domestic demand and output in the United States has continued, without evident inflationary pressure.  In the euro area, growth and business confidence have weakened further, though the ECB’s sharp interest rate reduction in April should help to support activity.  It is unclear when Japan will emerge from protracted recession.  Spreads on emerging market debt have moderated, there are signs of renewed growth in some countries affected by the Asian crisis, and Brazil has made progress towards stability.  Trade imbalances among the major industrialised countries have widened. In the United Kingdom, aggregate output growth slowed slightly earlier than believed at the time of the February Inflation Report.  Growth in the third and fourth quarters of 1998 was revised down to 0.3% and 0.1% respectively, and the preliminary estimate of growth in the first quarter of this year was 0.1%.  Service sector growth stands in contrast to declining manufacturing production.  Forward-looking business survey indicators have risen uniformly in recent months, and there are some signs—for example in the housing market—of restored consumer confidence.   Output continued to rise because domestic demand growth offset the weakening external position.  The trade  ii Inflation Report:  May 1999 balance made a negative contribution to growth for the third successive year, equivalent to 1.8 percentage points of GDP in 1998.  Consumption growth picked up in the fourth quarter of last year, and investment demand has been stronger than expected.  The extent of any inventory overhang seems to have been reduced.  The March Budget left public expenditure plans and the overall stance of fiscal policy broadly unchanged. In line with the slowdown in GDP growth, broad money growth continued to moderate in the first quarter, largely reflecting reduced money holdings by the non-bank financial sector.  Personal sector borrowing has shown signs of more rapid growth, however.  Consistent with other evidence of renewed strength in the housing market, there have recently been marked increases in secured lending and loan approvals.   The labour market remains tight on most measures, but is not currently tightening further.  Unemployment has increased slightly over the past three months, but remains close to its lowest level for twenty years. Aggregate employment has continued to grow quite robustly despite slower output growth, so measured productivity growth has fallen.  Service sector employment has risen;  that in manufacturing has fallen. Total hours worked have been broadly flat, so hours worked per head have fallen, reflecting less overtime and a growing proportion of part-time workers in the labour force.  Vacancies remain high relative to unemployment. However, skill shortages appear to have eased, and survey data suggest that firms’ employment intentions are significantly weaker than a year ago.  Publication of the official Average Earnings Index was resumed in March.  According to the new headline measure, nominal earnings growth reached a peak of 5.7% in the second quarter of 1998—higher than previously thought—before easing to about 4.5% at the turn of the year.  Evidence on private sector wage settlements also points to lower inflationary pressure in the labour market.  At the same time, the substantial reduction that has occurred in inflation expectations means that real earnings growth has fallen by less than nominal earnings growth, and, on some measures, may have risen.   Most measures of expected inflation are now consistent with the 21/2% inflation target. The implications for prospective inflation of reduced pay pressure and stronger sterling were the main factors that  iii Overview led the Monetary Policy Committee to reduce interest rates by a further 0.25% to 5.25% in April.   The MPC’s current projection for the growth rate of GDP—based on the assumption that the Bank’s repo rate remains constant at 5.25%—is shown in Chart 1.  The central projection is for the four-quarter rate of GDP growth to rise later this year from its current level of between 1/2% and 1% to around trend by the middle of next year.  The profile is similar to the February projection, but the pick-up in growth in the central projection begins slightly sooner, domestic demand growth is stronger, and net trade is weaker.  The probability of a decline in output is judged to have fallen.   The corresponding projection for RPIX inflation is shown in Chart 2.  The most likely path is for inflation to fall slightly below target over the next year or so, before rising to around 2.5% at the two-year forecast horizon. The projected decline in inflation in the near term is largely the result of lower nominal earnings growth and a higher starting-point for sterling than previously assumed.  Inflation rises towards the forecast horizon as demand growth strengthens and as the restraining influence on prices of the strong exchange rate wears off.  Indeed, the projection assumes that sterling declines from its present high level, at least in line with interest rate differentials. The uncertainties surrounding the projection for GDP growth are broadly balanced.  The possibility of a fall in equity wealth is a downside risk for consumption. Upside risks to activity arise from the possibilities that sterling will be weaker, and that stockbuilding will be less negative, than in the central projection.  Assuming that the exchange rate is likely to decline by more than implied by interest rate differentials, the balance of risks to inflation is upwards.  However, some Committee members see greater downside risks to inflation from a stronger exchange rate profile, weaker world activity and prices, and greater pressure on margins, than in the central projection. The starting-point for sterling in the projection is 41/2% higher than assumed in the February Report.  The rise in the exchange rate is likely to exacerbate the imbalance between the international and domestic sectors of the economy.  It is also likely to bear down on inflation in the short term.  The projection assumes that sterling will decline from its present high level.

But if sterling does not decline, then, depending on other developments in the economy, further easing of monetary policy might be needed to prevent undershooting of the inflation target. The economy is now on course for growth with price stability.  But exchange rate movements and other events affecting inflation are inevitably uncertain.  As those events unfold, the Monetary Policy Committee will continue to set interest rates at whatever level it judges necessary to keep inflation on track to meet the 21/2% target.

Section 2 The international environment Quarterly Bulletin, May 1999, pages 152–60.  3 Money and financial markets 1 Annual growth in broad money continued to slow in the first quarter of 1999, largely reflecting a further decline in the rate of growth of non-bank financial sector holdings.  Year-on-year growth in M4 lending slowed by less, leaving it slightly above the annual rate of growth in broad money.  Growth in lending to individuals secured on dwellings increased in the first quarter of 1999, in line with strengthening activity in the housing market.   Share prices rose internationally, in many cases to record levels.  Following stronger-than-expected global economic data, conventional government bond yields rose in a number of G7 countries, including the United Kingdom.  Sterling appreciated significantly, in particular against the euro.   At its March meeting, the MPC voted to leave interest rates unchanged at 5.5%.  The MPC voted to cut the Bank’s repo rate by 0.25 percentage points to 5.25% on 8 April.  The MPC voted to leave interest rates unchanged at its meeting on 6 May. 1.1 Money and credit  Narrow money The value of notes and coin in circulation increased by 0.7% in April, raising the twelve-month growth rate to 5.8% (see Table 1.A).  Growth in notes and coin has been picking up since September.  That is consistent with a fall in the opportunity cost of holding money as interest rates have been reduced.  Annual growth in nominal retail sales also picked up slightly in 1999 Q1. However, the relationship between narrow money and nominal retail sales growth has not been as strong in this recovery as during the 1980s. Broad money The rate of increase in broad money has continued to moderate.  Annual growth fell by around 4 percentage points between 1997 Q1 and 1999 Q1, to 6.9%. Annualised short-term rates of growth remained below the twelve-month rate, suggesting that the annual rate may slow further.  That would bring it more into line with the rate of broad money growth consistent with the MPC’s central projections for activity and inflation, Table 1.A Growth rates of narrow and broad money(a) Per cent 1 month 3 months (b) 6 months (b) 12 months Notes & coin Jan. 1999 0.5 6.1 6.1 5.4 Feb. 0.5 6.5 6.1 5.4 Mar. 0.5 5.7 5.7 5.6 Apr. 0.7 6.5 6.3 5.8 M4 Dec. 1998 0.7 6.4 7.5 8.2 Jan. 1999 0.1 4.4 5.1 7.6 Feb. 0.5 5.4 6.2 7.2 Mar. 0.4 3.9 5.1 6.9 M4 lending (c) Dec. 1998 0.6 5.4 7.6 7.9 Jan. 1999 0.5 4.9 6.6 7.8 Feb. 0.5 6.5 6.1 7.0 Mar. 0.7 7.1 6.2 7.4 Source:  Bank of England.

The annual rate of increase in bank and building society lending to the rest of the private sector (M4 lending) was 7.2% in the first quarter of 1999, slightly above the growth in M4 deposits (see Chart 1.1). Private non-financial corporations (PNFCs) Net M4 borrowing (borrowing(1) minus deposits) by private non-financial corporations rose significantly between 1997 Q4 and 1998 Q4, as annual deposit growth fell from 6.7% to 4.3%, and growth in borrowing picked up from 3.4% to 6.3%.  By 1998 Q4, the corporate sector financial deficit had reached 3% of GDP—its highest level since 1990.  Net M4 borrowing by the corporate sector fell by £3.3 billion in the first quarter of 1999, reflecting both a drop in borrowing and an increase in deposits.  However, private non-financial corporations can also raise funds through wholesale markets.  Capital market issues rose by £6.1 billion in 1999 Q1, compared with a rise of £2.4 billion in  1998 Q4.  So overall corporate sector borrowing remained strong in the first quarter of 1999. Firms tend to finance temporary imbalances between current income and expenditure mainly through net borrowing from banks and building societies.  There was a rise in the stock to output ratio relative to its long-run trend during the second half of 1998.  Firms may therefore have borrowed more and/or run down their deposits with banks, in order to finance the cost of holding any excess stocks (see Chart 1.2).  The increase in corporate sector borrowing relative to deposits may also have been linked to the strong rise in business investment in the second half of 1998. Household sector Household sector broad money holdings grew by 6.5% in the year to the first quarter of 1999, the same rate of growth as in 1998 Q4.  Lending(1) to households was 7.8% higher in 1999 Q1 than a year earlier, compared with an average rate of growth of 7.2% during 1998.   Bank and building society lending to individuals can be divided into lending secured on dwellings, which accounts for about 85% of the stock, and unsecured lending which accounts for the rest.  Annual growth in net secured lending to individuals picked up from 5.5% in 1998 Q2 to 6.2% in 1999 Q1.

Money and financial markets 5 which includes lending by specialist institutions other than banks and building societies, annual growth in lending secured on dwellings was 6.4% in the first quarter of 1999.  By contrast, growth in unsecured lending which had been rising very rapidly, appears to have stabilised in recent quarters, though it remained well above the growth in secured lending (see Chart 1.3). The rise in secured lending in the first quarter of 1999 was consistent with other indicators of improving demand in the housing market.  In March, the number of loans approved for house purchase rose to 101,000 from 89,000 in February, and the value of loans approved for secured lending rose to £10.2 billion.  The value of loans approved, which includes re-mortgaging agreements, has tended to lead changes in secured lending by 4–6 weeks. That suggests that the growth in secured lending to individuals will remain robust in coming months (see Chart 1.4). Other financial corporations (OFCs) OFCs are non-bank financial intermediaries.  After growing at an average annual rate of more than 22% between 1995 Q1 and 1998 Q3, growth in OFCs’ M4 deposits slowed in 1998 Q4 and fell sharply to 6.6% in the first quarter of 1999.  Annual growth in lending to the non-bank financial sector, which had averaged more than 16% during the same period, also slowed in  1998 Q4, and declined further to 8.4% in 1999 Q1. The increase and subsequent contraction in OFCs’ balance sheets has broadly coincided with changes in net sterling lending by UK banks and building societies to non-UK residents (see Chart 1.5).  The average monthly flow in net sterling lending to non-UK residents was  £1.1 billion between January 1996 and June 1998, compared with £0.2 billion during 1992–95.  It has since fallen back sharply;  overseas residents made a total  net repayment of sterling loans of £7.1 billion in  1999 Q1. It is possible, therefore, that the sterling borrowed by overseas residents was used to carry out transactions with UK financial intermediaries.  However, there is little evidence that the funds were intended for the acquisition of UK companies.  Chart 1.6 shows that  cash-financed mergers and acquisitions activity has been relatively subdued during the past two years. Furthermore, the rise in OFCs’ deposit growth since 1996 was not accounted for by an increase in M4 Chart 1.5 Net overseas borrowing(a) in sterling and  OFCs’ deposits 10 5 0 5 10 15 1991 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 Net sterling borrowing   by non-UK residents OFCs’ deposits  Flows, £ billions + _ Source:  Bank of England.

Inflation Report:  May 1999 6 holdings by insurance companies and pension funds, which hold around 60% of quoted UK equities by value. Instead the rise in deposits reflects increased holdings by the rest of the non-bank financial sector, which includes securities dealers (see Chart 1.7).   Another explanation for the increase in net sterling borrowing by non-UK residents may therefore be an increase in overseas demand for other UK securities. Alternatively, the observed correlation between the increase in OFCs’ deposits and net overseas sterling borrowing may simply reflect a desire by UK banks and building societies to match their assets (in this case, sterling lending overseas) with deposits from the UK wholesale sector. The reasons for the sudden reversal of net overseas borrowing in sterling in the first quarter of 1999 are similarly unclear.  Nonetheless, to the extent that they are linked, further reductions in net overseas borrowing in sterling, and hence in OFCs’ deposit growth, could help to stabilise broad money velocity, which has been falling since 1994.  As Chart 1.8 shows, excluding the M4 deposits held by the UK non-bank financial sector, broad money has been growing in line with nominal GDP during the 1990s.  A more stable, and hence more predictable, trend in M4 velocity would enhance the ability of broad money to act as a reliable indicator of inflationary pressure. Divisia money Another way of trying to gauge the extent to which the recent changes in the demand for money represent shifts in agents’ current or future demand for goods and services is to compare the growth of M4 with growth in Divisia money.  The Divisia index is constructed by weighting together the various components of money according to their liquidity, proxied by the inverse of their interest rates relative to a benchmark local authority deposit rate.  More liquid assets carry lower interest rates, and so are more likely to be used for transactions purposes.  Divisia money should therefore be more closely related to nominal spending than other broad measures of money.  Divisia money grew by 7.3% in the year to 1999 Q1, broadly unchanged from 1998 Q4, but slightly faster than the rate of growth in M4 deposits. Chart 1.9 shows the positive correlation between Divisia money and nominal domestic demand over the past  20 years, though the relationship has been somewhat weaker since 1995.

The  short-run impact of changes in monetary policy on aggregate demand and the exchange rate will depend on a number of factors.  These include the extent to which changes in the central bank’s official short-term interest rate were anticipated and the speed with which they are passed on to consumers and firms.(1) Short-term administered rates, such as mortgage and deposit rates, generally respond fully to changes in official interest rates, but there can be significant time-lags (see  Chart 1.10).  The pass-through of the interest rate cut of 8 April has so far been less than complete (see  Table 1.B), in contrast to the other cuts since the beginning of October which were passed through relatively quickly.  Risk-neutral probability distributions of expected  three-month market rates derived from options prices on 5 May are shown in Chart 1.11.  Uncertainty about the likely path of interest rates over the next year, as measured by the width of the blue fan, has narrowed a little on the downside since the February Report.  Market expectations for the most likely outcome shown by the darkest blue band were, on balance, for rates to remain close to their current level, though there were some expectations of a rise in 2000.   The European Central Bank cut its refinancing rate by 0.5 percentage points to 2.5% on 8 April.  The market expects short-term rates in the euro area to remain close to their current level over the next year.  The Bank of Japan cut its official target rate, the overnight call rate, by 0.1 percentage points to 0.15% on 12 February, and by a further 0.12 percentage points to 0.03% on  4 March.  The US Federal Reserve has not changed rates since November.   Long-term interest rates Nominal yields on UK government bonds at all maturities have fallen substantially since 1996, but have risen since the February Report.  The nominal yield on ten-year gilts rose by 0.4 percentage points to 4.8% between 10 February and 5 May, largely driven by higher interest rate expectations at the shorter end of the (1) For a discussion of how official interest rate decisions affect economic activity and inflation, see ‘The transmission mechanism of monetary policy’ in the May 1999 Quarterly Bulletin, pages 161–70.

The chart depicts the probability distribution for short-term interest rates and is rather like a contour map. So at any given point, the depth of shading represents the height of the probability density function implied by the markets over a range of outcomes for short-term interest rates.  The markets judge that there is a 10% chance of interest rates being within the darkest, central band at any date.  Each successive pair of bands covers a further 20% of the probability distribution until 90% of the distribution is covered.  The bands widen as the time horizon is extended, indicating  increased uncertainty about interest rate outcomes.  Inflation Report:  May 1999 8 curve (see Chart 1.12).  The nominal yield on ten-year US and euro-area government bonds also rose over the same period, by around 0.5 percentage points, though this reflected higher short and medium-term interest rate expectations. Changes in nominal interest rate expectations reflect revisions to expectations about inflation, real interest rates and/or risk premia.  The recent increases in nominal bond yields appear to have been driven by higher inflation expectations.  In addition, the forward real rate of interest in France also fell (see Charts 1.13 and 1.14). Despite the recent rise in UK long-term real yields, they remain close to their lowest levels since index-linked government bonds were first introduced in 1981;  and well below those in other countries (see Chart 1.14).  A number of UK-specific institutional factors could account for part of this difference.  For example, the minimum funding requirement (MFR) for pension funds has led to strong institutional demand for bonds, particularly long-maturity and index-linked bonds.  In addition, there has been substantial demand from insurance companies for bonds, perhaps to hold as a hedge against liabilities arising from guarantees of minimum returns on annuities sold when yields were higher than they are at present.  These factors have led to a strong demand for sterling bonds, which has put upward pressure on the price of both conventional and index-linked UK government securities.   To the extent that yields on UK index-linked bonds have been depressed by these factors, measures of implied inflation expectations derived from the index-linked market will be exaggerated.  The implied rate of inflation in five years’ time derived from the bond market has risen by 0.4 percentage points since the February Report to 2.6%.  That is a larger rise than is implied by measures derived from other sources.  For example, inflation expectations over the same period derived from the Consensus Economics survey stood at 2.5% in April, 0.1–0.2 percentage points higher than in October.  And shorter-term inflation expectations derived from a variety of UK surveys fell further in  1999 Q2 (see Section 3). Equity prices Since the publication of the February Report, share prices have risen sharply in most developed economies, to record levels in some cases, including in the United Kingdom.

Money and financial markets 9 medium-sized UK companies have risen particularly strongly since February (see Chart 1.15).  Previous  work at the Bank suggests that domestic economic prospects are more likely to influence changes in  share prices of these companies than of larger companies, which tend to be more internationally orientated.   Equity prices are positively related to expectations  about future profits, but are negatively related to risk. Uncertainty about the future level of UK share prices,  as measured by options prices on the FT-SE 100, has fallen steadily since the beginning of 1999, more so than a similar measure for the United States.  The latest  Merrill Lynch survey of UK fund managers showed a positive balance of 33% who thought that the prospects for UK corporate profits were favourable—compared with a negative balance of 44% in February.  These factors are consistent with the strong pick-up in expectations for UK earnings per share growth since  the beginning of 1999, for both this year and next, as reported in the Merrill Lynch survey (see Chart 1.16). The MPC assumes that there is a greater risk of a fall in UK equity prices than of a further rise, relative to the central-case assumption of growth in line with nominal demand. Property prices Growth in the capital value of commercial property has been declining since the beginning of 1998.  And there was a slight decline in the annual rate of growth in the rental value of commercial property.  Inflation  indicators in the housing market were more mixed. Despite a strong rise in March, on both the Halifax and the Nationwide measures annual house price inflation remained weaker in the first few months of 1999 than  in 1998.  Annual house price inflation in London and  the South East, which has in the past led national house price inflation, weakened by less in the year to 1999 Q1. And the March Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) survey showed a net positive balance of 76% of estate agents reporting an increase in house prices in London, considerably higher than elsewhere.  The RICS survey also reported a fall to historical lows in the number of properties on estate agents’ books, which may constrain activity in the short run.  However, as noted above, loan approvals nationally for house purchases rose strongly in 1999 Q1, indicating continued strength in demand.

Inflation Report:  May 1999 10 Exchange rates The sterling effective exchange rate index (ERI) averaged 104.0 in the 15 working days up to and including 5 May (see Chart 1.17).  This is the  starting-point for the current projection and is around 41/2% higher than the path assumed at the time of the previous Report.  The level of the ERI is 23% higher than it was in August 1996, largely reflecting an increase of 29% in the value of sterling against euro-area currencies.  Sterling has risen by around 5% against the US dollar.  Since 1990, however, the appreciation of the broader measure of the ERI, which includes a number of emerging market currencies, has been greater than that of the narrower measure. Previous Reports have discussed a number of possible explanations for the rise in the sterling exchange rate since August 1996.  Around a half of the rise in the sterling ERI since February is consistent with the movements in the differential between expected UK interest rates and those overseas (see Chart 1.18).  But estimates of monetary news based on relative yield curves can explain little of the overall increase in the ERI since August 1996. There is considerable ambiguity about the link between the exchange rate and observable capital flows.  But the record surplus on investment income, which contributed to UK current account surpluses in 1997 and 1998, may explain part of the strength of sterling.  A permanent improvement in the UK investment income surplus would imply that UK residents would be able to finance a larger trade deficit than previously, without putting downward pressure on the exchange rate, making sterling assets relatively more attractive to hold.   International competitiveness depends on the level of the real exchange rate.  By combining forecasts of the expected nominal exchange rate and inflation expectations from the Consensus Economics survey, it is possible to arrive at an estimate of the expected value of the real ERI.  Chart 1.19 shows how successive expectations of a depreciation of the real exchange rate lessened over time. Chart 1.20 shows the path for the sterling ERI implied by market nominal interest rate differentials.  This method is based on the assumption that, other things being equal, currencies should adjust to equalise the rate of return on assets across countries.  So if UK forward rates are above those overseas, sterling is expected to Chart 1.17 Sterling effective exchange rates(a) 80 90 100 110 120 130 1990 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 Broad ERI ERI 1990 = 100 Chart 1.18 The exchange rate and monetary news 1 0 1 2 3 4 10 Feb. 24 Feb. 10 Mar. 24 Mar. 7 Apr. 21 Apr. 5 May Cumulative change  in ERI (per cent) (a)  Band of estimated monetary news  (percentage points) (b)  5 + – 1999 Source:  Bank of England.

(a) The ERI is a trade-weighted index of 20 countries’ exchange rates against  sterling.  The broad ERI is constructed using 49 countries’ exchange rates.  Money and financial markets 11 depreciate.  It shows that the markets expect the recent appreciation of sterling to unwind. In constructing its forecast, the MPC makes assumptions about the future path for sterling, conditional on unchanged UK interest rates.  In judging the most likely path for sterling, the MPC takes into account both interest rate differentials and risk factors.  In the central projection (the modal or most likely case), the sterling ERI is expected to depreciate by more than 4% to 99.6 by 2001 Q1.  On average, sterling is expected to decline more steeply than in the central projection.  Outside forecasts reported by Consensus Economics imply that the exchange rate is expected to decline more rapidly than in the central projection, reaching 96.7 after two years.  But some Committee members consider that the balance of risks around the central projection for the exchange rate is on the upside. 1.3 Summary UK broad money growth has continued to ease, but M4 lending growth has declined less, reflecting a rise in secured lending to individuals.  The past three years have been characterised by a significant build-up and subsequent contraction in UK financial intermediaries’ balance sheets, which may have been linked to the behaviour of net sterling borrowing by overseas residents.  There is some evidence of an increase in  long-term global inflation expectations, but in the United Kingdom comparisons between conventional and  index-linked yields may be distorted by institutional factors.  Share prices have risen strongly, possibly reflecting a better-than-expected outlook for domestic and global growth.  Sterling has appreciated significantly since the February Report, particularly against the euro.

Chart 2.2 Trade balances The quarterly growth rate of GDP remained weak in 1999 Q1 and the level of output in previous quarters has been revised down since the February Report.  However, survey measures of consumer and business confidence in the United Kingdom have rebounded and global economic prospects have improved slightly.  In 1998 Q4, exports fell and imports rose, causing the goods and services trade deficit to widen further.  This largely offset the impact on GDP of stronger consumption and investment growth. 2.1 Net trade(1) Net trade made a sizable negative contribution to output growth in 1998, the third consecutive year in which the increase in domestic demand has exceeded that of GDP. Chart 2.1 shows that movements in the trade position are strongly influenced by demand differences between the United Kingdom and its main trade partners.  This effect was small in 1998, however, as UK domestic demand growth was broadly the same as the (weighted) increase in demand in these countries.  Consequently, most of  last year’s rise in the trade deficit reflected other considerations, notably the sharp contraction in demand from the emerging market economies of Asia and the  oil-exporting countries (which, together, account for only around 15% of UK exports), and the continuing effects of sterling’s appreciation. In 1998 Q4, the deficit on the United Kingdom’s trade in goods and services reached 3.8% of GDP, its highest level in almost a decade.  Export volumes of goods and services fell by 1.6%, reducing them to broadly the same level as a year earlier, while import volumes of goods and services increased by 1.3%, leaving them 6.2% higher than a year earlier.  But despite these developments, the current account remained in surplus (see Chart 2.2), owing to terms of trade price effects and exceptionally low outflows of investment income—a number of foreign enterprises operating in the United Kingdom (primarily oil companies, banks, and securities dealers) made significant losses in the second half of 1998.

Chart 2.4 Consensus forecasts for 1999 GDP growth Source:  Consensus Economics. The weakness of exports in Q4 mainly reflected lower sales of goods to Europe and North America (see  Table 2.A).  Given that US demand has remained strong, the fall in sales to North America in Q4 was probably erratic;  export volumes to this market recovered in Q1. In contrast, exports to the European Union continued to decline in January and February, reflecting the effects of sterling’s appreciation against the euro-area currencies and weakening demand.  Among the developing countries, there is increasing evidence that Asian demand conditions have begun to stabilise.  As a result, the sharp decline in UK exports to this region has moderated since 1998 Q4 (see Chart 2.3).  However, the recent increase in the price of oil has yet to feed through to stronger UK sales to the oil-exporting countries. Looking ahead, the prospects for external demand seem a little brighter than the assessment made at the time of the February Report.  In its April forecast, the IMF raised its projection for this year’s world GDP growth by 0.1 percentage point, to 2.3%.  This largely reflected a reassessment of prospects for the industrial countries, with expected growth in North America revised upwards significantly and prospective growth in Japan and the euro area revised downwards.  Recent changes to private sector forecasts have generally followed these IMF revisions (see Chart 2.4).  Overall, the IMF now expects the GDP of advanced economies as a whole to increase by 2.0% in 1999 (0.4 percentage points higher than its December forecast). Large demand changes in the emerging market economies can also have a significant impact on the  UK trade balance, as the Asian crisis demonstrated. Following the collapse of Brazil’s exchange rate regime in January, private sector forecasts of Latin American growth in 1999 have been marked down by around  2 percentage points.  The direct impact on the United Kingdom of lower growth in Latin America is likely to be small, however, since this region accounts for only about 21/2% of UK exports and less than 5% of total world trade.  Contagion effects to other emerging market economies have generally been limited and growth projections for some of the Asia Pacific countries have now started to be revised up slightly. Taking all these developments together, the prospects for UK trade-weighted world import growth have improved modestly, relative to the assessment made at the time of the February Inflation Report.  The MPC has consequently revised up its central expectation for UK export market growth in 2000 to 5%–6%, and left the Table 2.A UK goods export growth  Per cent  Region Share of total Average quarterly changes in export  UK goods  volumes (a) exports in 1997 1998 1999 Q1–Q3 Q4 Q1 European Union 55.8 1.4 -1.2 n.a.

(a) Goods import volumes by the United Kingdom’s trade partners,  calculated using UK trade weights. projection for this year unchanged at around 4%–5%. The MPC’s central projection is for demand growth in the major six overseas economies to exceed UK domestic demand growth slightly this year.   Competitiveness effects have also contributed to the rising trade deficit.  In particular, the real appreciation of sterling over the past three years (see Chart 2.5) has boosted imports and constrained exports.  In addition, trade diversion arising from the depressed demand conditions in Japan and the rest of Asia may have increased the degree of global competition facing British firms. Evidence of these competitiveness effects can be seen in both the United Kingdom’s export and import performance.  On the export side, firms located in the United Kingdom have accounted for a declining share of both EU and non-EU markets over the past two years (see Chart 2.6), as UK exports have failed to keep pace with the (weighted) import growth of the United Kingdom’s trade partners (see Chart 2.7).  This loss of trade share has been particularly striking in EU markets; prior to 1996, the United Kingdom had been increasing its trade share in these markets.  And, on the import side, import penetration now appears to have been greater than previously thought;  data revisions since the February Report have increased the share of imports in domestic demand in 1998. Overall, relative demand conditions are likely to be broadly neutral for the trade deficit this year.  Hence  the dominant influence on the trade balance in 1999 is likely to be the strength of sterling and non-price competitiveness effects.  The MPC’s central projection is for net trade to make another negative contribution to GDP growth in 1999 and for this effect to be more negative than was assumed at the time of the February Report.   2.2 Domestic demand Domestic demand increased by 1.0% in 1998 Q4, up from 0.5% in both Q2 and Q3.  This increase reflected stronger growth in consumption and investment, as well as a rise in the contribution to growth from the change in inventories (see Table 2.B).  Despite this faster quarterly growth, the annual rate of increase continued to slow— in the year to 1998 Q4, domestic demand grew by 2.7%, down from 3.3% in Q2 and Q3.

Although the Q4 outturn was a little stronger than the MPC’s central projection at the time of the February Report, the increase in spending was not evenly based.  In line with the fall in retail sales volumes in Q4, spending on retail goods (which account for about 40% of total consumption) actually declined.  The faster growth of total consumption reflected continued strong spending on most categories of services, combined with a rebound in expenditure on vehicles and energy products. Evidence from retail sales and consumer confidence surveys suggests that household consumption may have grown at a similar rate in 1999 Q1.  Following the decline in Q4, the volume of retail sales increased by 1.1% in the first quarter.  Recent CBI Distributive Trades surveys have confirmed this picture of stronger retail spending and have indicated an expectation among retailers that this sales growth would be maintained in Q2.  Similarly, survey measures of consumer confidence have improved considerably since their low points in October (see Chart 2.9).  Consumer fears about higher unemployment have also partly receded and housing market activity, another indicator of consumer sentiment, has picked up since the end of last year. The previous Inflation Report, and minutes of recent MPC meetings, have noted that the slowdown in consumption growth during 1998 was sharper than the MPC had expected, and have discussed a number of possible reasons for this.  One of these was that past fiscal tightening may have been greater than previously thought.  Unfortunately, this has been difficult to assess, since a number of changes came into effect at around the same time.  These included the July 1997 Budget measures, a new system of self-assessment for income tax, and an extension to the returns deadline.  Since the third of these elements significantly altered the pattern of tax payments between 1997 Q4 and 1998 Q1 (see  Chart 2.10), the full impact of the changes will not be known until the new seasonal pattern of receipts can be determined.  On the basis of the available data, the effective tax rate on households’ income is estimated to have increased by between 1/2 and 1 percentage point in 1998, equivalent to 0.4%–0.7% of GDP.  Higher taxes are therefore likely to explain some of the slowdown in the growth rate of consumption last year.  The actual size of this effect will have been determined by whether households viewed the tax changes as temporary or 1990 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 Percentage changes Quarter on previous quarter Year on previous year + _ Average annual growth rate (1955–98) Chart 2.8 Household consumption growth Table 2.B Quarterly growth rate of GDP(a) Percentage change  1998 Q2 Q3 Q4 Consumption: Households 0.5 0.1 0.6 Non profit making institutions  serving households 0.4 0.2 0.2 Government 0.4 0.6 0.3 Investment  -0.7 2.6 2.9 Final domestic demand 0.2 0.6 0.9 Change in inventories (b)(c) -0.1 -0.1 0.0 Domestic demand 0.5 0.5 1.0 Net trade (b) -0.3 -0.3 -0.9 GDP at market prices 0.3 0.3 0.1 (a) At constant 1995 market prices.

Non seasonally adjusted data. Chart 2.11 Real household pre-tax income growth permanent, and by the extent to which the introduction of the new system of self-assessment encouraged an increase in tax compliance. Looking ahead, the measures introduced in the March 1999 Budget are expected by HM Treasury to leave the effective tax rate on household incomes broadly unchanged over the next three years.  Overall, therefore, the factors which may have caused consumption growth to slow by more than the MPC had expected in 1998— higher taxes, lower consumer confidence, and the unwinding of the windfall payout effects arising from the building society demutualisations—seem likely to have less of a restraining influence in 1999.  This suggests that the growth rate of consumption will become more closely aligned with its fundamental determinants (labour income and total net wealth) this year. As can be seen from Chart 2.11, the growth rate of real pre-tax primary incomes (wages and salaries plus net property income) slowed in 1998.  This was largely because of higher net interest payments by the household sector and weaker growth in equity dividends; the growth rate of real wages and salaries remained reasonably robust.  This slowdown in the growth rate of primary incomes is unlikely to continue in 1999. Households’ net interest payments are likely to fall in 1999, as the rise in official interest rates over the  14 months to June 1998 has now been more than completely reversed.  This fall in official interest rates tends to feed through to lower loan rates for households with a lag, partly because of the impact of fixed-rate loans (see Section 1).  In addition, surveys by the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) have found a recovery in firms’ profit expectations in recent months, suggesting that the growth rate of dividend payments is unlikely to weaken much further in 1999. Household spending will also be affected by wage and salary developments and wealth considerations.  The MPC’s central expectation is that this year’s growth rate of real earnings may be slightly stronger than in 1998 (see Section 6).  Furthermore, there are likely to be positive wealth effects on spending stemming from higher house and equity prices.  Consequently, it seems likely that consumption growth will gradually return to around its trend rate of increase over the next twelve months.  Demand and output 17 Investment demand Whole-economy investment increased by 2.9% in Q4 and the level of investment in Q3 was revised up by 1% relative to the position reported in December.  Business and government investment both increased strongly in the fourth quarter, more than offsetting a 5.7% decline in private sector spending on dwellings.  The Q4 outturn for total investment was stronger than the MPC’s central projection at the time of the February Report. Investment reflects the difference between the current and desired levels of a firm’s capital stock.  This, in  turn, is influenced by the current level of capacity utilisation, expectations about future output and profits, the firm’s financial position, advances in technology,  and the cost of capital.  Unfortunately, the desired capital stock is not directly observable.  As a result, attention (at the macroeconomic level) is generally focused on proxy measures, such as the estimated deviation from trend of the capital stock to GDP ratio and survey measures of capacity utilisation rates and investment intentions. The ONS has recently published revised estimates for the capital stock, following the recommendations of a study undertaken by the National Institute.(1) This study highlighted the possibility that previous estimates of the UK capital stock were too large, since they failed to take enough account of capital scrapping in economic downturns and of the effects of rapid technological change.  In particular, there may have been an increasing amount of investment in assets with shorter lives, notably computers and related equipment. Chart 2.12 shows the business sector capital stock to output ratio on the basis of the new figures.  As a result of revised assumptions about the service lives of assets, the estimated level of the net capital stock in 1997 is now around 4% lower than previously thought.  Despite the strong growth in business investment over the past four years, the capital stock to output ratio has only just returned to its long-run average.  The revisions may help to explain why business spending on capital has exceeded the MPC’s expectations recently, and suggest that this year’s growth rate of investment may not slow by as much as had been previously thought.

Inflation Report:  May 1999 18 Turning to the other influences on investment, the real cost of borrowing faced by firms continues to fall. Interest rates have been reduced further in the past few months;  the London clearing banks’ base rate is now at its lowest level since 1994 Q3.  And equity prices have rebounded strongly since October, with the FT-SE All-Share index reaching new highs in April (see Section 1). The latest BCC survey found that profit expectations among service sector firms recovered in 1999 Q1. Correspondingly, investment intentions in the sector have also improved.  Although these intentions remain below the levels observed in 1997, they are close to the balances recorded during 1994–96 (see Chart 2.13), suggesting that further growth in service sector investment is likely. However, BCC survey results suggest that investment intentions among manufacturers remain significantly weaker than for service sector companies.  The CBI’s measure of capacity utilisation in manufacturing remains well below the levels reached at the end of 1997.  And, although there has been an improvement in confidence about future turnover and profitability, the balance of manufacturing firms expecting to authorise more capital spending remains low by historical standards (see Chart 2.14). The turn of the Millennium is also likely to affect the profile of investment between 1999 and 2000,  with spending both on construction projects and IT equipment being brought forward, boosting investment this year.  Around 40% of firms contacted by the  Bank’s Agents in April indicated that they still had outstanding Millennium-related investment spending plans.  About two thirds of this expenditure was expected to be additional, rather than displacing other investment. Overall, the prospects for business investment growth have improved relative to the position three months  ago.  The MPC has therefore revised its central projection upwards;  in 1999, the annual growth rate  of business investment is expected to slow to around its trend rate of increase.  Given the recent improvement in indicators of housing market activity, private sector investment spending on dwellings (which makes up around 15% of total investment) is also likely to strengthen this year. 20 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Percentage point balances Investment intentions  (plant and machinery) Profit expectations + _ 1989 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 _ Percentage point balances 1989 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 20 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Capacity utilisation (CBI) Profit expectations (BCC) Investment intentions (BCC) 99 + Chart 2.13 Influences on services investment Source:  BCC. Chart 2.14 Influences on manufacturing investment Sources:  CBI and BCC.  Demand and output 19 General government investment is estimated to have increased by 9.1% in Q4, and the level of public investment in the first three quarters of the year was also revised upwards since the February Report.  The March Budget maintained the government’s commitment to increase the ratio of public sector net investment to GDP to 1% by financial year 2001–02.  Since net investment was only 0.4% of GDP in 1998–99, the growth rate of government capital expenditure is likely to remain robust. Inventory investment Whole-economy inventories (excluding the alignment adjustment) increased by £0.7 billion (at 1995 prices) in Q4, in line with the rise in Q3.  Inventory levels in the distributive trades sector were broadly unchanged in the fourth quarter and they fell in the manufacturing sector (see Chart 2.15).  Consequently, most of the stockbuilding was concentrated in other sectors of the economy.  Evidence from the Bank’s Agents and the CBI suggests that concern about stock levels among manufacturers and distributors diminished in 1999 Q1 (see Chart 2.16).  However, there was a pick-up in the CBI Distributive Trades Survey measure of stocks relative to expected sales in April.  Overall, the MPC’s central projection continues to be that stockbuilding will detract from output growth this year.  The recent improvement in the survey evidence does suggest, however, that the size of the unwanted inventory overhang may not be as large as the MPC had previously thought likely.  Precautionary stockbuilding ahead of the Millennium may also affect the quarterly profile of inventory investment. Public sector demand Real general government consumption increased by 1.7% in the year to 1998 Q4.  In assessing the outlook for the public finances, the MPC has taken as its central case the nominal government expenditure plans and effective tax rates from the 9 March Budget statement. The Government intends to expand current nominal spending on goods and services by 5.3% this financial year.  Given that current spending is estimated to have increased by 4.7% in 1998–99, the growth rate of real government consumption is likely to rise.  But, the overall stance of fiscal policy is not expected to  change much—HM Treasury estimate that the government’s cyclically adjusted net borrowing position will decrease by 0.1% of GDP between 1998–99 and 1999–2000.

Inflation Report:  May 1999 20 2.3 Output According to the preliminary estimate, GDP (at constant market prices) increased by 0.1% in 1999 Q1.  This, together with revisions to previous quarters, lowered the annual rate of increase to 0.7% (see Chart 2.17), a little below the MPC’s central projection at the time of the February Report.  The level of the basic price measure of GDP in 1998 Q4 has been reduced by 0.2% since the January National Accounts release, while the level of the market price measure has been lowered by 0.5%.  These revisions were mainly the result of lower estimates of VAT receipts and company profits. The strength of economic activity across different sectors of the economy continues to differ markedly (see Chart 2.18).  Industrial production fell by 1.2% between December and February, leaving the average level in the first two months of 1999 0.2% lower than a year earlier. In contrast, service sector output increased by 0.4% in 1999 Q1, and by 2.3% in the year to Q1.  Much of this divergence has been linked to the industrial sector’s greater exposure to international competition.  However, longer-term structural factors (such as technological progress) have also played a role in the growth of services relative to industrial production.  Such considerations have been particularly pronounced in the communications sector (see the box opposite). Manufacturing output fell again in February, its sixth monthly decline in seven months.  Survey evidence suggests that output may have continued to fall in March.  However, there are some signs that the rate of contraction may be easing.  The CBI’s measure of business optimism improved to -6 in April, from -40 in January, and the balance of firms expecting to increase output over the next four months has become steadily less negative since October (see Chart 2.19).  Similarly, although the BCC’s latest survey continued to indicate lower sales and orders in Q1, the pace of the contraction in orders appears to have moderated.  And, although remaining below the neutral level of 50, the aggregate index of conditions in the manufacturing sector, produced by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS), has been rising since October. Construction output remained weak in the fourth quarter, rising by just 0.1%, following declines in Q2 and Q3. However, the growth rate of activity may have increased in Q1—the volume of new construction orders rose by 2.2% in the second half of 1998 and the CIPS survey of 1993 94 95 96 97 98 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Percentage changes on a year earlier Manufacturing Services GDP + _ Chart 2.18 Annual growth rate of GDP 1993 94 95 96 97 98 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Quarter on a year earlier Quarter on previous quarter Percentage changes 99 Chart 2.17 GDP growth rate(a) (a) At 1995 market prices. 1990 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 50 40 30 20 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 Percentage balances Percentage change on previous quarter ONS data (left-hand scale) Expected output (a) (right-hand scale) + _ 99 + _ Chart 2.19 Manufacturing output Sources:  CBI and ONS.

Demand and output 21 The growth rate of the communications sector (defined as postal and telecommunications services) has averaged about 5% per year since 1960 and 10% per year since the 1990–92 recession.  Communications has been one of the fastest-growing sectors of the economy, accounting for a rising share of output (up from around 1.4% of GDP in 1955 to 3.7% of GDP in 1998). This rapid growth in demand for communications services has had beneficial spill-over effects for the manufacturing sector.  As Chart A shows, production of electrical and optical equipment (which includes much of the hardware used in telecommunications) has increased by more than 40% since 1991, while total manufacturing output has increased by only around 9%.  In addition, improvements in communications technology will also have had beneficial productivity effects for other sectors of the economy. Similar trends are evident in households’ spending patterns.  In recent years, increases in spending on communications services and audio-visual equipment (which includes mobile phones and computers) have far exceeded the rise in total consumption (see Chart B). Total call minutes provided by the telecommunications sector have increased at an average annual rate of around 10% over the past four years.  Given the rising demand for Internet services and mobile phones (subscriptions to mobile phone networks increased by almost 27% in the year to March 1998), further strong demand growth seems likely. Reflecting these developments, increases in the share prices of telecommunications companies have far exceeded the rise in the overall stock market since 1980. The high price-earnings multiples for these companies indicate that the market expects the sector’s strong growth in turnover to continue. Rising demand for telecommunication services has partly reflected sizable price reductions.  Since 1992, prices for household telephone services have fallen on average by almost 3% per year.  Given the rise in other retail prices over this period, the relative price of communications services has declined even more sharply (see Chart C). These price declines have been driven by a number of factors.  In particular, advances in technology have enabled significant productivity improvements.  Since the beginning of the recovery in 1992, output per head has increased by about 75% in the communications sector, compared with 15% for the whole economy.  This productivity improvement was also influenced by the privatisation of British Telecom, increasing competition, and the regulatory pricing formula used by Oftel. 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190 1991 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 Electrical and  optical equipment Communications services 1991 Q1 = 100 Total manufacturing Total services 1991 93 95 97 99 65 75 85 95 105 Jan. 1991 = 100 Retail prices of  telephone services Communications  equipment 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190 200 1991 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 1991 Q1 = 100 Communications services Audio-visual  equipment Total Chart A Output by sector at 1995 prices Chart C Relative price of communications Chart B Consumption by sector at 1995 prices Note: The price of communications-related equipment is defined relative to the producer  price index.

The communications industry The communications sector provides a good example of the way in which changes in technology and tastes have led to rapid expansion in the service sector.  Inflation Report:  May 1999 22 construction activity rose to 57.4 in April, up from 45.5 in Q4. Despite the slowdown in the growth rate of services output in Q1, the sentiment of firms in this sector has improved in recent months.  BCC measures of sales and orders for domestic and export markets rose in the first quarter, and confidence about turnover has bounced back from last year’s lows (see Chart 2.20).  Similarly, the CIPS indicator of service sector business expectations has improved steadily since September, and their overall index of current activity increased to 56.3 in April, above the neutral level of 50.  2.4 Summary In the Committee’s judgment, the prospects for overall activity have changed relatively little since the February Report, but the composition of demand is likely to be different.  The central projection for domestic demand growth has been revised upwards, reflecting the  pick-up in consumer and business confidence,  stronger-than-expected investment, and the impact of lower interest rates.  In addition, the downside risks to output from a significant stock cycle appear to have diminished relative to the position three months ago.  But the stronger stimulus to output is likely to be largely offset by a weaker outlook for net trade.  Reflecting these considerations, the MPC’s central forecast continues to be for a gradual improvement in the growth rate of GDP during the course of 1999.  1990 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 1.0 0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 15 25 35 45 55 65 75 Percentage balances Percentage change  on previous quarter ONS data (left-hand scale) Confidence about turnover (right-hand scale) + 99 Sources:  BCC and ONS.

Nominal earnings growth fell during the second half of 1998, according to the reinstated Average Earnings Index (AEI) and other indicators.  The AEI headline rate picked up slightly to 4.6% in February, but other measures pointed to a further moderation in nominal earnings growth in the first quarter of this year. Earnings growth is likely to have been boosted in April by the introduction of the National Minimum Wage and the implementation of the public sector pay review body awards.  Unemployment has risen slightly and total hours worked have been flat.  But unemployment rates remain close to 20-year lows, and employment has continued to grow quite strongly, matched by a fall in inactivity.  The number of job vacancies is still high relative to unemployment.  But business surveys suggest that skill shortages have abated somewhat, and most measures of employment intentions have fallen further. 3.1 Earnings The official Average Earnings Index (AEI) was reinstated by the ONS on 2 March, following an independent review of the series commissioned by the Chancellor.  The box on the next page summarises the main findings of the review and the methodological changes made.  Chart 3.1 compares the new  headline measure of average earnings growth—a  backward-looking three-month moving average rather than a centred measure as previously—with the version suspended on 2 November last year, and with its predecessor, which was last updated on 6 October. The new measure rises steadily from mid 1995 to a peak of 5.7% in June 1998—above the peaks in the previous two series—before falling back sharply to 4.5% in December 1998 and January 1999.  Headline earnings growth rose slightly to 4.6% in February. As the box discusses, the ONS is carrying out further work to improve the quality of the AEI.  Until this work is completed, it is hard to know how much weight to place on the index.  In some respects, the new series presents fewer interpretational difficulties than the suspended measure.  First, there is no longer a marked  Inflation Report:  May 1999 24 Background The Average Earnings Index (AEI) is a measure of the growth in whole-economy average weekly earnings per head.  It is constructed from monthly survey data on the pay bills and employment of a sample of employers, grouped by size and industrial sector.  To make the sample representative of the economy as a whole, returns from each employer in the sample are first scaled up by a ‘grossing factor’.  The less comprehensive the sample’s coverage of that type of employer, the larger the grossing factor.  Average earnings in each sector are calculated  by dividing total pay by total employment.  And  whole-economy average earnings are derived from these industry measures, combined using sectoral employment weights. The AEI was first published in its present form in 1989. The sample of employers was partly updated in 1994 and early 1998, but the grossing factors and sectoral employment weights remained fixed at their initial values until 14 October last year, when (among other things) the employment weights used in the published series were updated and the new Interdepartmental Business Register was used to reclassify firms and update the grossing factors.  These revisions had a significant impact on the index, and on 23 October the Chancellor commissioned an independent review of the new series.  On  2 November, the ONS decided to suspend the AEI while the review took place.  The review was published on  2 March 1999.(1) Main findings of the review G The review found, first, that responses from some individual firms in the sample were having an excessive influence on the AEI.  The AEI sample was known to under-represent some important parts of the economy, particularly those with a high concentration of smaller firms (mainly in the service sectors).  To compensate for this, grossing factors applied to smaller firms in the sample were increased sharply in the October 1998 revisions.  But this made the aggregate index much more sensitive to the returns of a relatively small number of employers, some of whom reported volatile wages from month to month.  For example, the smallest size band in the financial intermediation sector consisted of only two firms.  Between April and May 1998, large increases in these firms’ reported wages contributed nearly  1 percentage point to the rise in the recorded growth rate of the suspended AEI.   To bring the AEI up to best practice, the review emphasised that the sample must be expanded and made more representative.  In the shorter term, it proposed that small financial intermediation firms be given a lower weight in the index, that the private health and social work sector be excluded from the index before June 1998, and that the ‘other business services’ sector be consolidated with the rest of the business services sector.  The review also recommended that erratic individual returns or ‘outliers’ should be more formally analysed and— where particularly volatile—given a reduced  weight. G Second, historical AEI growth rates were being influenced on a monthly basis not only by changes in respondents’ average earnings, but also by changes in sample composition and changes in the grossing factors applied to firms.  If a firm paying relatively high wages fell out of the sample (because it had ceased to trade or had forgotten to report) measured growth in the old index would fall, even if the average earnings growth of all reporting firms remained the same.  AEI growth rates were also being affected by monthly reassessments of firm size, which sometimes caused sharp changes in the grossing factors applied to individual firms. To address these problems, the review recommended that monthly AEI growth rates be calculated using only those returns from a ‘matched sample’ of employers reporting in both months.  And the grossing factors applied to firms should be changed less frequently, at the same time as the sectoral employment weights, and in a way that did not affect monthly growth rates. G Third, the ONS had faced difficulties allocating some employers to sub-categories within the public sector and, separately, within the agriculture, fisheries and foods sector.  The review therefore recommended that each sector should be consolidated into a single unit. Next steps All of the short-term changes recommended by the review were adopted in the new AEI published on  2 March.  Data based on the improved sample—which is crucial to help bring the AEI up towards best statistical practice—together with statistical measures of volatility in the AEI should begin to be available from September. The ONS is to report to the Economic Secretary to the Treasury by the end of 1999 on the progress made towards implementation of these and the other recommendations of the review.

Second, the new series is, broadly speaking, more consistent with other earnings  measures over the past few years (see Chart 3.2).(1) And third, measured earnings growth is less volatile  than it was on the suspended measure (see Table 3.A). Nevertheless, the new AEI can still move sharply over short periods:  for example, the pick-up in the headline measure in February partly reflected a rise in the  twelve-month growth rate of earnings, from 4.2% in December 1998 to 5.0% in February.  This makes it harder to draw inferences about the underlying trend of earnings growth.  Other indicators—including the Reward Index and surveys from the Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services (FRES) on the pay of permanent and temporary staff—suggest that annual earnings growth continued to fall in the first quarter of 1999.  The FRES measures picked up slightly in April. Earnings growth can be expressed as the sum of  wage settlements and a term known as ‘wage drift’.   The Bank’s estimate of the twelve-month  employment-weighted mean settlement has been stable between 3.6% and 3.7% since April 1998.  So arithmetically, most of the sharp slowdown—and subsequent slight pick-up—in the annual growth of the official average earnings measure since June last year can be accounted for by changes in wage drift (see  Chart 3.3).  Wage drift includes factors such as bonuses, overtime payments, shift premia, merit pay,  profit-related pay, and compositional shifts in the workforce.  So movements in earnings growth since June primarily reflect changes in some or all of these components. Some of the fall in wage drift probably reflects slower growth in bonuses.  Until January this year, firms in the AEI sample were asked to record the amount of bonuses or commissions paid, but only if there had been a significant change.  One difficulty with using these data to measure bonus growth is that bonuses not thought to have changed significantly would not have been (1) The National Accounts wages and salaries measure is benchmarked on an annual basis to estimates of pay data compiled from employers’ tax returns.  These annual data are independent of the AEI, but are only available with a lag.  The quarterly profile is based on data from the AEI, the Workforce jobs series and other sources, subject to a number of technical adjustments.  Some of these adjustments had a significant effect on the growth profile during 1998, and are currently under review by the ONS.

Inflation Report:  May 1999 26 captured.  If some reporting firms thought that payments in a particular month had changed significantly in one year, but not in the same month in the previous year (or vice versa), measured twelve-month growth rates of bonuses would be biased.  Subject to this caveat,  Table 3.B shows that bonuses and commissions recorded in this way boosted earnings growth in the first half of 1998, but were having little or no effect on earnings growth by the three-month period ending in January this year. One reason for paying bonuses is to reward staff for past productivity and profitability gains.  So some of the fall in bonus growth in the second half of 1998 may reflect the slowdown in corporate profit and productivity growth.  But bonuses are also paid to maintain and improve staff retention, so a decline in bonus growth may also signal looser labour market conditions. Although current unemployment has been close to  20-year lows, concerns about future unemployment rose sharply in the second half of last year, according  to the GfK survey (see Chart 3.4).  This may have  reduced the need for firms to make special payments during that period to retain staff.  Respondents to the GfK survey have become less concerned about future unemployment in recent months, consistent with the more general improvement in consumer confidence (see Section 2). It is not possible to identify the contribution of bonuses to the rise in annual earnings growth in February. Starting from February, firms in the AEI sample have been asked to record all bonuses paid, and not just those they consider to be significant.  In the longer run, this should remove the problems with the previous approach. But the substantially higher number of firms now reporting bonuses means that measured annual growth rates are likely to overstate the true rate of bonus growth until February 2000.  In principle, this change should affect only the split of total recorded pay between bonus and non-bonus components:  firms have always been asked to report their total gross pay.  It is possible, however, that some firms have begun reporting bonuses as part of total pay, when previously they had not.(1) That would have raised the recorded annual growth rate of overall earnings in February.  But the ONS says that it has found no evidence of this occurring. (1) The AEI review noted that the reporting arrangements left a degree of ambiguity over whether or not to include bonuses in total pay.  Firms have been reminded by the ONS of the need to include all bonuses.

The labour market 27 Earnings growth has also been depressed by a fall in overtime payments in recent months.  Overtime is sensitive to demand conditions:  in the past, there has been a close relationship between the annual growth in overtime payments as measured by the New Earnings Survey and the annual growth of nominal GDP (see Chart 3.5).  Consistent with the slowdown in output growth, the average number of paid overtime hours per worker in the six months to February was about 8% lower than in the same period a year earlier, according to more recent data from the Labour Force Survey. A third factor likely to have put downward pressure on nominal earnings growth is the fall in inflation expectations over the past twelve months.   Wage-bargainers care about the expected real value of earnings—workers because it determines their expected ability to purchase goods and services, and firms because it determines their expected real labour costs.  When inflation expectations fall, a given rise in expected real wages can be achieved with a lower increase in nominal wages.  Most of the measures of one year ahead inflation expectations from the Barclays Basix Survey fell further between 1998 Q4 and 1999 Q1 (see Table 3.C), and have fallen markedly since the first half of 1998.  Other surveys show a similar pattern. Consistent with the fall in inflation expectations, average employment-weighted wage settlements in 1998 Q4 and 1999 Q1 were lower than in the same periods a year earlier, reversing the previous upward trend (see  Chart 3.6).  These declines were fairly broadly based. According to the Bank’s database, more than 80% of employees covered by settlements concluded in the first quarter of the year received a lower settlement in 1999 than in 1998 (see Chart 3.7). Increases in the pay of some workers to meet the requirements of the National Minimum Wage, outside the standard settlement, are likely to have put some upward pressure on earnings growth in recent months. The National Minimum Wage formally came into effect on 1 April, but there appears to have been significant anticipation, with some firms beginning to pay the National Minimum Wage last autumn and some implementing rises in stages over a period of time. Earnings growth will also have been affected by the implementation of the public sector pay review body awards, which raised the wages of the 1.2 million workers covered by an average of 4.1% on 1 April.

In the chart, LFS data are centred around  March, June, September and December, for comparability with the  Workforce jobs measure. The awards, which unlike last year’s settlements will  not be phased in over the year, are likely to add around 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points to annual growth in  whole-economy average earnings between April and December.  Average earnings in the public sector have been growing less rapidly than private sector pay since early 1993, but have slowed less sharply since the middle of last year.  Overall, however, the news since the February Report suggests that the pressures on nominal earnings growth have eased somewhat.  In light of the slowdown in earnings growth since last summer, the fall in inflation expectations, the reduction in settlements during the first quarter of this year and evidence on the determinants of wage drift, the MPC has lowered the profile for nominal earnings growth in its central projection relative to that in the February Report.  3.2 Employment and unemployment Pay pressure is influenced by both the degree and the rate of change of labour market tightness.  Although quantity indicators give a mixed picture, most suggest that labour market pressures have eased slightly, but remain significant by recent historical standards. Whole-economy employment has continued to grow quite strongly (see Chart 3.8).  Labour Force Survey (LFS) employment rose by 80,000 (0.3%) in the three months to February, and the Workforce jobs measure rose by 48,000 (0.2%) in 1998 Q4. But while the number of people in work rose, average hours worked fell, leaving total hours worked—in principle, a better measure of labour usage—unchanged in the three months to February (see Table 3.D).  The fall in average hours reflected two main factors.  First, average hours worked by those in full-time employment fell by 0.5% in the three months to February, consistent with a fall in overtime.  And second, a relatively large proportion of recent employment growth was accounted for by a rise in part-time workers, who typically work about 40% of the hours of full-timers. It is possible that some of the strength of recent employment growth may have reflected firms taking on staff in the expectation that demand growth will soon pick up again.  The Bank’s regional Agents conducted a survey of their contacts’ employment intentions in March.  Some of those planning to recruit were doing so even though they considered their staffing to be more Chart 3.7 Differences between wage settlements in  1998 and 1999 for those settling in  Q1 in both years(a) 0 10 20 30 40 50 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 Percentage of employees covered 3 _ + Change in settlement (percentage points) Source:  Bank of England.

Employment has grown relatively rapidly compared with the growth in output since the mid 1990s.  Consequently, annual growth in the official measure of whole-economy labour productivity—the amount of output per employed person—has averaged only about 11/2% since 1995, below the longer-run historical average of around 2% (see Chart 3.9).  Developments in labour productivity are important for assessing inflationary pressures.  A change in the rate of labour productivity growth which is not reflected in earnings growth affects firms’ unit labour costs.  And, in the longer run, real earnings should rise in line with trend productivity growth. There is no strong evidence that the trend rate of labour productivity growth has shifted:  since the start of the 1990s recovery, productivity growth has averaged just over 2%, in line with the longer-run average.  But the cyclical behaviour of productivity growth does appear to have been different in the 1990s.  Historically, productivity growth has tended to rise strongly during the early part of a recovery and to fall sharply during  a downturn, reflecting the delayed response of employment to changes in output.  During the 1990s, cyclical swings in productivity have been rather less pronounced.  This is likely to have reflected a range of influences.  But one possible factor is that the labour market reforms of the last two decades, together with other structural changes in the economy, have increased the speed and flexibility with which employers can adjust both the number of employees and the amount of hours worked in response to changes in demand.  In its central projection for inflation, the MPC has assumed that productivity growth will continue to be somewhat less cyclical over the forecast period. Aggregate unemployment has risen slightly, having been stable or falling during last year.  LFS unemployment rose by 32,000 in the three months to February, and the claimant count increased slightly in February and March. The LFS measure of redundancies in the three months to February was 52,000 higher than a year earlier.   Short-term LFS unemployment, the number of people unemployed for less than one year, has been rising since May last year (see Chart 3.10).  The duration structure of unemployment may contain useful information on inflationary pressures in the labour market.

So, for a given level of unemployment, a rise in the share accounted for by the recently employed may increase the stock of relevant skills available to firms, putting downward pressure on wages.  But if the recent rise in the number of short-term unemployed reflects an increasing mismatch between the skills demanded by firms and those offered by people who have recently moved into unemployment, the implications for wage pressure are less straightforward.  Although both  short-term and whole-economy unemployment measures have risen recently, unemployment rates remain low by recent historical standards (see Chart 3.10). The recent rise in both employment and unemployment was associated with a decline in the number of people who are economically inactive (those who are neither employed nor actively searching for work).  The inactivity rate has been falling since early 1998, having been broadly flat since the start of the 1990s recovery. The extent to which changes in employment are associated with changes in inactivity rather than changes in unemployment affects the prospects for inflation, because the inactive are assumed to exert less downward pressure on earnings than the unemployed.  In the past, inactivity has tended to be counter-cyclical, falling in recoveries as people are attracted out of inactivity into searching for—and acquiring—work, and rising in downturns.  So changes in unemployment have usually been rather smaller than changes in employment (see Chart 3.11).  During the 1990s recovery, however, the normal cyclical pattern has been weakened by a trend rise in the number of students and long-term sick.  The MPC has taken account of this in its inflation projections. Indicators of job vacancies and skill shortages provide an alternative way of assessing the relationship between the supply of, and unsatisfied demand for, labour.  Vacancy measures have fallen:  in March, the official number of Jobcentre vacancies was 12,400 below its peak in November last year, and the NTC Press Recruitment Advertising Index was at its lowest level since  December 1996.  Recent Jobcentre data have been distorted by reporting problems in Northern Ireland and the West Midlands, the net effect of which is that the official vacancy data probably overstate the true rise in vacancies since early 1998.  But even excluding these factors, vacancies remain high relative to unemployment when compared with the previous cycle (see Chart 3.12).

Data are also adjusted for an overstated stock of vacancies from 1996 Q2 onwards caused by difficulties with the Jobcentre computer system.  The labour market 31 Alternative measures of the relationship between vacancies and unemployment, based on Jobcentre vacancy and unemployment inflows, suggest a similar picture.  Skill shortages and recruitment difficulties  have also eased since last year, according to business surveys (see Chart 3.13).  The CBI survey suggests that the constraint on output posed by skill shortages is now well below average in manufacturing.  But, despite  recent falls, BCC measures of recruitment difficulties— which cover both skilled and unskilled labour—remain well above average in both services and manufacturing, consistent with continued labour market tightness. Business surveys suggest that employment intentions have weakened since the middle of last year (see  Table 3.E).  After seasonal adjustment, the Manpower whole-economy survey balance stayed below its  long-run average in 1999 Q1.  The outlook for manufacturing employment is still weak on all measures, although the BCC and CBI surveys suggest that the rate of decline in employment intentions may have slowed in Q1.  Employment intentions in the service sector— which accounts for a much larger share of total employment—remain rather stronger, according to the BCC and Manpower measures.  The survey of contacts carried out by the Bank’s regional Agents in March found a similar picture, with more than half of manufacturers reporting that employment levels were expected to be lower over the next six months, but more than three quarters of service sector firms expecting to maintain or raise employment. Previous Reports have set out the MPC’s analysis of  the implications for inflation of recent Government policies designed to affect the supply of and demand for labour, including the New Deal and the Working Families Tax Credit.  The March Budget contained  a number of further measures.  In forming its latest inflation projection the MPC has decided not to adjust its assumptions.  But these assumptions will be kept under regular review as further data and research become available. 3.3 Summary The labour market remains tight.  Unemployment is close to 20-year lows, employment has continued to grow, inactivity has fallen, and the stock of job vacancies remains high relative to the level of unemployment.

Inflation Report:  May 1999 32 National Minimum Wage in April, are likely to continue to underpin earnings growth in the next few months.   Nevertheless, there have been signs of an easing in labour market conditions since the February Report. Nominal earnings growth has moderated since last summer, according to the newly reinstated Average Earnings Index and other measures, and wage settlements have begun to fall, consistent with the slowdown in the growth of output and profits, and a reduction in inflation expectations.  Unemployment has risen slightly, the number of hours worked has been flat, skill shortages have abated, and surveys of employment intentions suggest that employment growth may decline in the coming months.  Taken together, and compared with the February Report, these factors point to somewhat weaker inflationary pressures from the labour market over the forecast period.  33 Costs and prices 4 RPIX inflation has remained stable and close to target since July 1998.  The oil price has risen since the February Report, though prices of other commodities have generally continued to fall.  And the appreciation of sterling’s effective exchange rate since February is likely to place further downward pressure on imported goods prices.  UK producer prices have reflected the rise in the oil price, but overall cost pressures in the manufacturing sector remain subdued.  Inflation has remained higher for services than for goods, though business surveys suggest that cost pressures in the service sector have eased. 4.1 Raw materials and commodity prices Brent crude oil prices rose to around $15 per barrel at the end of March, following a twelve-year low of less than $10 per barrel at the end of 1998.  The rise in oil prices was prompted by production cuts by OPEC.  Since these were introduced in April, prices have risen further, and averaged $16 per barrel over the two weeks to  5 May, similar to the prices prevailing at the end of 1997.  The MPC has assumed that oil prices will remain around current levels over the forecast period. In contrast to oil prices, world prices of raw materials and non-oil commodities have generally continued to fall.  The Economist index of non-oil commodity prices measured in US dollars was around 5% lower in the three months to April compared with the previous three months, and some 17% lower than a year earlier.  The IMF, World Bank, OECD and Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) project lower average prices in 1999 than in 1998.  That is largely a result of the further broadly based price falls seen in early 1999.  Higher prices are forecast for 2000 than in 1999 (see Table 4.A).  The Bank’s sterling non-oil commodity price index is weighted by UK demand and has a higher weight for wholesale food, including UK produce, than the Economist index.(1) Prices of some of the non-oil Table 4.A Non-oil commodity prices in US dollars: forecasts for 1999 and 2000 Annual average percentage changes on a year earlier 1998 Outturn (a) 1999 (b) 2000 EIU -16.1 -8.6 6.8 IMF -14.8 -4.0 1.8 OECD -14.0 -6.2 0.3 World Bank -15.6 -10.6 3.0 (a) 1998 outturns vary because of the different composition of the  basket of goods used in the indices. (b) All forecasts were published in April/May 1999. (1) The Bank’s index is available on a monthly basis and is compared with the Economist index because it is also updated frequently.  The other indices which are shown in Table 4.A are available only on a quarterly basis, though are based on broader weights than the Economist index.  Inflation Report:  May 1999 34 commodities measured by the Bank index have risen since the beginning of the year and the annual rate of deflation of the index has declined (see Chart 4.1).  The fall in wholesale food prices has accounted for more than half of the fall in the Bank’s non-oil commodity price index since its peak in December 1995 (see Table 4.B). This partly reflects the impact of changes in sterling intervention prices under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and falling livestock prices.  But wholesale food prices have risen since January. The February Report noted that, since 1 January 1999, intervention prices under the CAP have been calculated in euros and translated into sterling using the market exchange rate.  Intervention prices in sterling fell during 1999 Q1 as sterling appreciated against the euro.  The ‘Agenda 2000’ package, which includes further changes to the CAP, was agreed by EU Member States at the end of March.  The agreed cuts to intervention prices are less than those originally proposed by the European Commission.  Price reductions are to be phased in over a few years for cereals and beef, and the reduction in milk prices will not be implemented until 2005–06.  The impact on the inflation rate is therefore likely to be negligible over the forecast period. The MPC’s central projection assumes that the fall in  non-oil commodity prices comes to an end in 1999 and, in line with other forecasts, that dollar prices of commodities increase in 2000. 4.2 Import prices and the exchange rate Sterling prices of imported goods and services fell by 5.7% in the year to 1998 Q4, and were 14.8% lower than in 1996 Q2, just prior to sterling’s marked appreciation. Goods account for around 80% of total UK imports and services 20%.  Since 1996 Q2, the prices of imported goods have fallen much more than those of services. Prices in sterling of imported goods have fallen by 16.5% since 1996 Q2, but those for services have fallen by 8.3%.  Over the past twelve months the prices of imported services have risen. Import prices both of goods and services were initially slow to respond to the appreciation of sterling.  Despite falling world prices for manufactures during 1997–98, the decline in imported goods prices broadly matched the extent of the appreciation only by 1998 Q4 as sterling fell back a little (see Chart 4.2).

Costs and prices 35 on UK sales, perhaps because they thought that the appreciation was temporary.  Section 1 discussed how, in 1997 and 1998, Consensus Economics forecasts showed a sharper projected fall in the real exchange rate than actually occurred.  The ratio of UK import prices of goods and services relative to average export prices of the United Kingdom’s major trading partners rose in 1997 (see Chart 4.3).  But it fell back in 1998 as overseas suppliers appear to have narrowed their relative margins on UK sales.  Falling world prices for semi-finished and finished manufactures suggest that excess global capacity and the increased competitiveness of Asian exports in world markets may have had an effect. Producer prices in local currencies in the major overseas economies, except the United States, continued to fall in January and February.  That, combined with the recent appreciation of the exchange rate, suggests some further falls in UK imported goods prices are likely.  The MPC’s central projection assumes that sterling import prices will be weaker than expected at the time of the February Report.  Import prices continue to fall in the first half of 1999 but rise thereafter, as the effects of sterling’s appreciation fade and world demand growth picks up. 4.3 Costs and prices in manufacturing Inflation in the manufacturing sector has remained subdued.  Recent increases in fuel prices have broadly offset continued falls in both input and output prices of other manufactured goods.   Input prices fell by 0.4% in 1999 Q1, the slowest rate of decline since 1997 Q3.   And the April Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) survey of manufacturing pointed to less steep falls in input prices than in the previous nine months.  Output prices rose in February and March as  a result of changes to excise duties and higher fuel prices.  Excluding excise duties, output prices were broadly flat in 1999 Q1 and were 0.7% lower than a year earlier.  The CBI survey measure—which in the past has moved fairly closely with producer output prices (see Chart 4.4)—points to small falls in prices over the next four months.   4.4 Costs and prices in the service sector Survey data for the service sector pointed to lower costs and output price inflation in the second half of 1998, but survey balances rose a little in 1999 Q1.  The CIPS services survey index of the cost of all inputs fell in the second half of 1998 but rose in the first four months of 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 1985 87 89 91 93 95 97 1995 = 100 1992 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 40 30 20 10 0 10 20 30 40 8 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 Four-month annualised  percentage changes Percentage balance Output price inflation (a)    (right-hand scale)  CBI price expectations (b)   (left-hand scale) + – + – Chart 4.3 Ratio of UK import prices to major six  overseas economies’ export prices(a) Chart 4.4 Producer output price inflation and the  CBI price expectations balance Sources:  CBI and ONS.

Inflation Report:  May 1999 36 1999.  The CIPS survey measure of prices charged was above the neutral level of 50 in March and April, following five months when the balance of responses was consistent with downward pressure on prices.  The BCC survey measure of output price inflation in the service sector was unchanged in 1999 Q1, though cost pressures from settlements and other overheads were reported to have increased. The ONS is developing an aggregate measure of corporate services output inflation (see page 35 of the February 1999 Report).  The twelve sub-component series which are published generally pointed to lower inflation in 1998 Q4:  six pointed to lower price increases in 1998 Q4 than in Q3 and two showed no change.  Three of the four series where price increases were higher related to the transport sector. 4.5 Retail prices Retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments (RPIX) inflation remained close to target in 1999 Q1. The rise in RPIX inflation in March, to 2.7%, was a result of the temporary effect of changes in the timing of excise duties announced in the Budget (see below). RPIY inflation, which also excludes indirect and local authorities’ taxes, fell to 1.7%.  The headline RPI inflation rate was unchanged at 2.1%, as a fall in mortgage interest payments offset the impact of  higher duties (see Chart 4.5).   The Budget in 1999 was earlier than in 1998, and increases in fuel duties took effect before the March collection date for the RPI.  Fuel duties therefore affected the March RPI this year but not last year. Increases in tobacco duties were brought forward to March from December.  These changes, if passed on in full, would have added around 0.4 percentage points to RPIX inflation in March.  The increase will be largely reversed in April when the 1998 increase in road fuel duties (of close to 0.3 percentage points) drops out of the annual inflation rate.  And in December 1999, the effect of last year’s increase in tobacco duties will drop out of the annual inflation rate. The February Report noted that services price inflation has been above that for goods since December 1996. The gap widened from 1.0 percentage points in 1997 Q1 to 2.3 percentage points in 1998 Q4, as falling import prices bore down on goods price inflation.  The gap remained wide in 1999 Q1.

RPIY = RPIX excluding VAT, local authorities’ taxes and excise duties. (a) Adjusted by the Bank of England for ONS error in under-recording  aggregate price indices between February and May 1995.  Other  charts and tables in this Report that include measures of retail price  inflation are similarly adjusted.  Costs and prices 37 a little lower at 3.4% in 1999 Q1, and goods price inflation rose by 0.1 percentage point to 1.3%. Services price inflation has moved more closely with measures of domestically generated inflation (DGI) than goods price inflation over the past two years because of the lower import content of services.  Measures of DGI provided mixed signals about the direction of inflationary pressure at the end of 1998 (see Chart 4.6). The measure of RPIX inflation excluding import prices fell to 4.5% in 1998 Q4, its lowest rate since 1996 Q3. Inflation measured by the GDP deflator excluding export prices has remained close to 4% since the beginning of 1996.  The unit labour costs inflation measure rose to 4.4%, as productivity slowed. The DGI measures derived from RPIX and the GDP deflator are a combination of  domestic weighted costs and a mark-up of prices over costs.(1) In the short run, pricing behaviour will depend on the reasons for changes in costs and their interaction with current and expected demand conditions.  Firms may delay adjusting prices fully to an increase in costs if they view the change to be temporary.  But firms may be quicker to respond to a change in costs that has affected all firms in the same way—for example, an increase in general wage pressure.  There is also some evidence for the United Kingdom that the mark-up of prices over costs tends to rise when demand increases, but with a short lag.  The strength of demand in 1997 and early 1998 probably boosted prices relative to costs.  The subsequent slowdown in demand will tend to put downward pressure on prices relative to costs.  Section 6 discusses the behaviour of prices relative to costs over the forecast period. 4.6 Other price indices The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) is constructed from the same price quotes as RPIX but it has a different coverage, and a different method of index construction, so that it is directly comparable with HICP inflation rates of other EU Member States.(2) In March, UK HICP inflation was 1.7%, 0.7 percentage points higher than euro-area inflation.  Eurostat has recently published estimates of HICP inflation for the euro area prior to 1997.  UK HICP inflation was a little below that of the euro area between January 1993 and June 1995, 1993 94 95 96 97 98 Percentage changes on a year earlier 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 RPIX excluding import prices + – GDP deflator excluding   export prices (a) Unit labour costs    adjusted for trend    productivity (b) Chart 4.6 Measures of domestically generated inflation (a) Using GDP measured at market prices.

(2) Further details on the construction of HICP were set out in the February 1999 Report, page 38 and in Economic Trends, December 1998.  Inflation Report:  May 1999 38 but has been above it since then (see Chart 4.7).  UK services price inflation has been considerably higher than that in the euro area since 1996 (see Chart 4.8). That is perhaps a result of higher domestically generated inflation in the United Kingdom than in the euro area since then.  By contrast, UK goods price inflation has generally been lower than that for the euro area.  In the past two years that has probably reflected the rise in sterling’s effective exchange rate. Underlying developments in the rate of inflation are sometimes masked by sharp movements in individual prices.  Such price changes should be included in a measure of the cost of living.  But it is also useful to look at inflation rates excluding erratic price movements to gauge underlying inflationary pressure.  The Bank looks at two measures which reduce the effect of extreme price movements:  the median inflation rate and the trimmed mean inflation rate, which excludes the highest and lowest 15% of price changes.  These measures usually lie below RPIX inflation, as the price increases excluded from the measures generally exceed the price falls excluded (see Chart 4.9).  The measures showed a more gradual build-up in inflation towards the peak in the early 1990s.   In the recent past they have reduced the fluctuations resulting from sharp movements in seasonal food price inflation, and changes in the timing of duties.  Inflation on these measures fell slightly in early 1999. Inflation measured by the consumers’ expenditure deflator rose to 2.3% in 1998 Q4 from 2.0% in Q3.   That led to a pick-up in the annual inflation rate of the GDP deflator at market prices, which measures  whole-economy inflation.  It rose to 2.6% in 1998 Q4 from 2.2% in Q3.   4.7 Summary RPIX inflation has remained stable and close to target since July 1998.  Oil prices have risen since the February Report, while the world prices of other commodities have continued to fall and import prices have declined further.  UK manufacturing output prices were broadly flat in 1999 Q1.  But in most major overseas economies they continued to fall.  Combined with the higher exchange rate, that points to some renewed downward pressure on UK goods prices from abroad.  Inflation in the service sector has persisted at annual rates of above 3%, though survey data have continued to point to lower increases in costs.

The recent appreciation of sterling may place renewed downward pressure on goods prices in the short run; thereafter, the gap between domestic and imported inflationary pressures is expected to narrow gradually.  40 5 Monetary policy since the February Report This section summarises the economic developments and monetary policy decisions taken by the MPC since the February Report.  The minutes of the February, March and April meetings and the press notice from the May meeting are attached as an Annex to this Report. The Bank of England’s official dealing rate—the repo rate—was reduced from 5.5% in February to 5.25% in April, and was maintained at that level in May. At the time of the February Report, the central projection was for RPIX inflation to remain close to target over the two-year forecast period.  The risks around the projection were broadly balanced in the first year but were slightly on the downside in the second year. Greater than usual uncertainty surrounded the forecast, partly because of the difficulty of assessing labour cost pressure.  Some Committee members took the view that the inflation profile should be somewhat lower, because of expectations of stronger productivity growth or weaker world prices than assumed in the central projection. At its meeting on 2–3 March, the Committee noted that the prospects for global activity and prices were little changed since the February Report.  Outside the major industrial countries, renewed difficulties in Brazil had led to a further weakening of the real;  but other South American currencies did not appear to be under pressure. Though the risk of contagion remained, it had not materialised.  The sterling effective exchange rate had risen by 2% since the February Report.  Sterling had appreciated against the euro but depreciated against the US dollar;  these movements possibly reflected changes in expectations about relative demand prospects for the euro area, United States and United Kingdom.  The stronger exchange rate would, by itself, tend to reduce import prices and retail prices.  But the Committee judged that it was too soon to tell whether the appreciation would persist. There were two key domestic activity developments. First, the composition of expenditure had been published for 1998 Q4 and this included a small downward revision to the level of GDP at market prices.  Inventory accumulation made a larger contribution to GDP growth  Monetary policy since the February Report 41 than in Q3, offset by a larger negative contribution from net trade, primarily because of weaker exports.  Second, surveys had picked up somewhat from lows in the autumn;  and the improvement had been broadly based, including both domestic and export activity.  These two developments could be interpreted in a number of ways. The lower level of GDP could point to weaker demand than previously thought.  And the weaker outturn for exports could point to some of the downside risks to external demand feeding through.  But the rise in survey data, albeit from low levels, might point to a slightly better picture than previously expected.  Overall, the Committee judged that activity was in line with what had been expected at the time of the February Report, but the improvement in survey data, if sustained, could prove significant. Nominal price and cost pressures appeared to have weakened in the second half of 1998.  The Average Earnings Index (AEI) had been published again, following the independent review.  The level of earnings at the end of 1998 on the newly published series was broadly in line with the assumption in the February Report.  But earnings growth in the first half of 1998 had been higher than previously thought, and had then slowed more markedly than had been assumed.  The rate of increase of wage settlements had also slowed, and the Reward Index had declined on a broadly similar path to the Average Earnings Index in 1998.  The effective exchange rate was higher, though oil prices had also risen.  On balance, these developments suggested slightly lower prospective inflation than thought at the time of the February Report.  In its discussion of the immediate policy decision, some members of the Committee considered that the news on the month did not amount to a sufficient case for a further reduction in interest rates.  More evidence was required on the exchange rate, earnings and confidence. Another view was that the central projection in the February Report had been around 0.2 percentage points too high—the news on the month had suggested weaker activity and inflation, and so justified a cut in interest rates of 25–50 basis points.  The Committee voted to leave the repo rate unchanged at 5.5%. At its meeting on 7–8 April, the Committee discussed whether prospects for the world economy had improved over the previous month.  In the United States, domestic demand had continued to grow strongly, with little sign of a pick-up in inflation.  But there were few signs of  Inflation Report:  May 1999 42 recovery in Japan.  Output remained below potential in a number of euro-area economies, though expectations of an easing of monetary policy had increased.  Spreads on emerging market debt had narrowed during the month. Sentiment and, in some cases, activity was a little stronger in parts of Asia and Latin America.  So the downside risks to activity highlighted in the February Report appeared to have diminished slightly.  There were some signs that the fall in commodity prices was coming to an end, and oil prices had risen sharply.  But with most economies outside the United States below their productive capacity, the Committee viewed the scope for a generalised pick-up in inflation as limited.  The main news on domestic activity was the revisions to the levels of GDP and composition of expenditure in 1997 and 1998.  The estimated level of GDP at market prices in 1998 Q4 had been reduced by 1/2%, but by only 1/4% when measured at basic prices.  The composition of expenditure showed an upward revision to consumption and investment, with business investment significantly higher.  But the revisions resulted in a larger negative contribution from net trade, largely as a result of higher imports.  At the same time, inventory accumulation was revised downwards, and suggested that the risks of a significant stock cycle in 1999 had diminished.  Survey evidence suggested an improvement in business confidence, albeit from a low base.  The Committee agreed that the Budget had little altered the outlook for inflation.  Overall, the prospects for activity remained broadly as expected at the time of the February Report.  In assessing the prospects for inflation, the Committee discussed the implications of lower earnings growth and settlements.  Earnings growth had remained on a downward trend;  but the implications for inflation would depend on a variety of factors including productivity and margins.  Productivity had been low relative to its long-run average over the past three years; so unit labour costs were correspondingly higher.  But the pass-through from unit labour costs to prices was not straightforward.  It would depend on cyclical conditions and on other input prices.  The Committee decided to consider these issues further in the context of the May Report.  The effective exchange rate had remained higher over the past month and was more than 2% higher than assumed in the February Report, which by itself would tend to dampen inflation. In its discussion of the immediate policy decision, the Committee considered that the prospects for activity  Monetary policy since the February Report 43 overall were little changed and that some of the previously identified downside risks to both the world and the UK economy appeared to have diminished.  The prospects for inflation had shifted further towards the downside.  The effective exchange rate was stronger, and nominal earnings growth seemed lower, than expected. Against this background, the Committee voted to cut the Bank’s repo rate by 0.25% to 5.25%. At its meeting on 5–6 May, the Committee voted to leave the repo rate unchanged at 5.25%.  44 6 Prospects for inflation 6.1 The inflation projection assumptions This Report, which the Committee approved on 7 May, contains the Committee’s assessment of developments in the economy since February, and prospects for the medium term.  Charts 6.1 and 6.2 below show projections for GDP growth and RPIX inflation up to two years ahead, and the uncertainties surrounding them. The projections assume that the Bank’s repo interest rate will remain unchanged at 5.25% during the next two years, and are conditioned on the assumptions described below. After successive downward revisions to global economic prospects through the autumn and winter months, there has been a slight improvement in the outlook for world activity since the February Report.  Momentum in the US economy appears stronger than judged earlier, raising forecast GDP growth there in 1999.  However, prospects for the euro area are slightly weaker than estimated three months ago.  Recent GDP growth has been sluggish, although the 0.5% cut in ECB interest rates in early April should support future activity.  The outlook for Japan remains depressed.  Outside the major industrial countries, there are some encouraging signs of recovery in the emerging Asian economies.  Interest rate spreads on emerging market debt over US Treasuries have fallen over the past three months, although they remain well above the levels of the first half of 1998. Overall, there has been a small upward revision to the central projection for global growth.  The MPC now assumes that growth in UK-weighted export markets will rise from 4%–5% in 1999 to the 5%–6% range in 2000, still well below the average over the 1990s.  Moreover, UK exporters may continue to lose market share, as the effects of the appreciation of sterling continue to work through.   Global inflationary pressures remain quite weak. Manufactured goods prices continue to edge down internationally as current demand falls short of production capacity.  And although some rise in non-oil commodity prices is assumed over the forecast period, they fell further than expected over the winter months. In contrast, oil prices have risen sharply recently, in response to the OPEC plan to scale back production.  The  Prospects for inflation 45 planned supply reduction has brought forward the recovery in oil prices projected in February.  Oil prices are expected to be higher in the short to medium term than anticipated in February, but no change is expected in the long-run level.  Taking these developments together, there is little change in the relatively subdued outlook for world inflation.  However, import prices in sterling are likely to be weaker than expected in the February Report, given the further appreciation of the exchange rate. The sterling exchange rate, as measured by the effective Exchange Rate Index (ERI), averaged 104.0 in the  15 working days up to and including 5 May.  This forms the starting-point for the exchange rate profile assumed in the projection.  It compares with a starting-point of 100.1 at the time of the February Report and an implied level of 99.4 for May.  The starting-point for the exchange rate is thus some 41/2% higher than the path assumed in February.  The recent rise has been particularly marked against the euro.  Changes in market perceptions of future interest rates at home and abroad could account for a significant portion of the recent increase in sterling. The MPC takes both interest rate differentials and risk factors into account in formulating assumptions on the path of sterling.  In the central projection, the sterling ERI declines to 99.6 by the end of the two-year forecast period, consistent with bilateral sterling exchange rates of about $1.62 and 0.69 against the euro (equivalent to DM 2.82).  On average, sterling is expected to decline more steeply than in the central projection.  Outside forecasts reported by Consensus Economics imply that the exchange rate is expected to decline more rapidly than in the central projection, reaching 96.7 after two years.  But some Committee members considered that the balance of risks around the central projection for the exchange rate was on the upside. The MPC continues to base the central projection on the Government’s announced public spending plans and forecasts of effective tax rates.  The May projections are based on the March Budget.  There is relatively little difference in the overall fiscal stance from the autumn pre-Budget statement, which formed the basis for the February projection.  Lower levels of social security transfers offset the reduction in taxation announced in the Budget. The National Minimum Wage came into effect on 1 April, following the introduction of the Working Time  Inflation Report:  May 1999 46 Directive in October 1998 and the New Deal in early 1998.  Previous projections incorporated assumptions about the effects of these labour market reforms.  No changes have been made to these assumptions in the central projection, although the upside risk to earnings from a stronger minimum wage impact has been reduced. 6.2 The medium-term inflation projection Output rose marginally in the first quarter of 1999 according to the preliminary GDP release in April.  The outturn was close to the flat central projection in the February Report, and by itself contained little news. However, prior to this, the February GDP release and the National Accounts published in March revised down the level of GDP and altered the estimated composition of demand in recent quarters.  At the end of 1998, the level of GDP measured at market prices was around 1/2% lower than previously estimated, although only 1/4% lower when measured in basic prices.  The implications of those revisions to output for future inflation are ambiguous.  On the one hand, the lower level of activity could indicate a reduction in pressures on capacity which, depending on the lags, could dampen future inflation.  On the other, the short-run trade-off between activity and inflation could be less favourable than previously thought.  The Committee concluded that, on either view, the revisions were not large enough to warrant a material change in the assessment of inflationary pressures. The composition of demand in the second half of 1998 differed from the central projection in the February Report in three main respects.  First, business investment rose strongly in the fourth quarter of 1998 and was revised up in earlier quarters.  Second, the degree of inventory build-up was rather lower, largely offsetting the impact of higher fixed investment on total domestic demand.  Third, net trade made a more negative contribution to GDP.  Imports were stronger than projected. The ratio of business investment to GDP rose further to a new record level.  The Committee considered two explanations for this apparent strength.  The first was that it might be linked to the Millennium, with companies bringing forward IT-related and construction spending.  Evidence from a recent survey of Bank Agents’ contacts provided some support for this view. The second explanation was that the desired level of  Prospects for inflation 47 business investment had been boosted, perhaps by higher IT-related spending which might have a shorter life-span than other components of the capital stock.  The Committee assigned some weight to both explanations, and having regard also to survey data on investment intentions, raised the projection for investment, particularly in 1999. The lower-than-expected level of inventories in the second half of 1998 has reduced the risks of a major stock correction in 1999.  Survey evidence suggests that manufacturers and retailers continued to shed stock in the early part of this year, but not sufficiently rapidly to lead to a dip in overall output.  The latest CBI survey for manufacturing suggests that stocks remain above desired levels, but that the extent of any overhang has been reduced.  However, the latest survey for distributive trades indicates that stocks were built up in April as demand failed to meet expectations.  Further falls in stocks seem likely in the coming months to eliminate the remaining excess.  This inventory reduction will detract from GDP growth.  Precautionary stockbuilding ahead of the Millennium may affect the timing from quarter to quarter.  The Committee judges that there is a risk that the aggregate stock-output ratio could fall less sharply than in the central projection, raising GDP and inflation. After the data revisions, the share of imports in domestic demand in 1998 was higher than estimated at the time of the February Report.  Bank Agents’ contacts report continued pressure from foreign competitors in both domestic and international markets, exacerbated by the further rise in sterling in recent months.  In assessing the overall prospects for net trade, the Committee judges that the dampening influences of stronger import penetration and the rise in sterling since February will outweigh the stimulatory effect of slightly stronger world trade growth.  The central projection is that net exports will depress GDP growth in both 1999 and 2000, and by more than expected three months ago. Although there were some modifications to the quarterly profile, consumer spending growth in the second half of 1998 was in line with expectations in the February Report.  Sales over the Christmas period were sluggish. More recently, there have been tentative signs of recovery.  The GfK consumer confidence indicator has returned to positive territory.  Housing market indicators, which provide another barometer of consumer sentiment, have turned up.  Personal lending figures are also rather stronger and mortgage approvals are up sharply, while  Inflation Report:  May 1999 48 the rise of over 10% in equity prices since the February Report has increased personal wealth.  These indicators provide support for the central projection that consumer spending growth will strengthen in the coming months in line with expectations at the time of the February Report. The Committee judges that the prospects for overall activity have changed relatively little from the February Report, although there are significant changes in some of the demand components.  Stronger investment and the impact of lower interest rates have raised the central projection for domestic demand growth.  But the additional stimulus to demand has been largely offset by a weaker outlook for net trade. The central projection is for the four-quarter growth rate of GDP at constant market prices to recover later this year from the current rate of between 1/2% and 1%, as domestic demand growth strengthens, and to return to assumed trend rates by the middle of next year (see Chart 6.1).(1) The four-quarter growth rate continues to rise thereafter, as the period of weaker growth drops out of the calculation, before levelling off by the end of the  two-year horizon. Recent survey evidence is consistent with the recovery in growth in the central projection, as business confidence indicators on a broad front have risen from the very weak levels of last autumn.  Indeed, the survey indicators are consistent with quarterly growth rates having passed their trough. Although recent outturns for activity were broadly in line with expectations, news on nominal variables over the past three months suggests that underlying inflationary pressures are weaker than previously thought.  The exchange rate has risen appreciably.  Broad money growth has continued to slow to a pace more consistent with the inflation target.  Surveys of inflation expectations have fallen further, which, other things being equal, should lead to lower growth in nominal wages and prices. The Average Earnings Index (AEI) was reinstated in early March, following the review commissioned by the Chancellor.  It will take time to implement all of the recommendations of the review and raise the quality of the index to the best statistical standards.  In the interim, the index remains an uncertain guide.

Prospects for inflation 49 suggests that nominal earnings growth fell more rapidly in the second half of 1998 than assumed at the time of the February Report, but from a higher peak in the spring.  However, the revised data for January and the preliminary estimate for February suggest that earnings growth may no longer be declining.  In contrast, wage settlements in the private sector appear to be lower than a year ago.  It is possible that earnings growth remains substantially higher than settlements because of bonuses and merit-based pay, although this is hard to assess given a statistical break in the information on irregular pay from February.  Increases in the pay of some workers to meet the requirements of the National Minimum Wage, outside the standard settlement, could also be a factor. Other indicators are mixed:  the Reward Index of earnings growth continued to slow in the first quarter, while the Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services survey reported an edging up of pay rates in April.  Implementation of the public sector pay review bodies’ recommendations will have added to earnings growth in the public sector from April.  But overall, the evidence from earnings and settlements, together with information from the Bank’s regional Agents, indicates a weakening in nominal pay pressures.  At the same time, the substantial reduction that has occurred in inflation expectations means that real earnings growth has fallen by less than nominal earnings growth and may on some measures have risen.  The Committee has lowered further the central projection for nominal earnings growth since the February Report. Over the past three months, employment has continued to rise, albeit at a slower pace than in the second half of last year.  Unemployment has edged up from near 20-year lows, partly as a greater number of previously inactive individuals have sought work.  The central projection continues to assume that employment growth will slow further, and indeed that employment may fall for a time while output growth is below trend. Productivity growth has an important influence on firms’ unit costs.  As noted in the February Report, measured productivity growth has been below trend for several years.  Moreover, productivity growth weakened further over the past year as employment continued to rise robustly when output growth was slowing.  Various explanations for the recent behaviour of productivity have been reviewed further.  In its central projection, the Committee has assumed that structural changes in the labour market have reduced the variability of productivity over the cycle.  While the reforms are  Inflation Report:  May 1999 50 beneficial, they may have temporarily reduced measured productivity growth in recent years.  Reforms may have encouraged firms to take on additional employees and to adjust hours worked more quickly than in the past, as well as leading to the creation of new jobs which may have lower than average levels of productivity.  Although a natural corollary would be that firms would also reduce labour more quickly in a cyclical downturn, the combination of a relatively tight labour market and perceptions that the slowdown was likely to be relatively moderate may have pushed in the opposite direction in recent months.  The Committee judges that productivity growth will return to its long-run historical average over the next two years, although the projected rise in measured productivity growth is somewhat less rapid than assumed in February. Empirical evidence suggests that firms tend to lower prices in relation to weighted costs when demand falls relative to supply capacity, although the effect may take time to feed through fully.  The central projection remains that companies will reduce price-cost margins further in response to the period of weak growth through late 1998 and 1999.  The Committee judges the effects of a change in demand on pricing behaviour to be similar on average over the cycle to the assumptions embodied in the February Report, but the central projection incorporates the view that a more flexible labour market has reduced the extent to which production is below its desired level, and hence the degree of downward pressure on margins.  The Committee recognises that the cyclical behaviour of productivity and price-cost margins is an area of considerable uncertainty. The Committee’s projection for the twelve-month RPIX inflation rate—based on the assumption that nominal interest rates are held constant at 5.25%—is shown in Chart 6.2.(1) It is presented alongside the projection from the February Report, which was based on constant interest rates at 5.5%. There are some differences between the current inflation profile and that shown in February.  The starting-point is slightly higher than in February, although this is entirely owing to the temporary effects on duties from the timing of the Budget.  As this effect drops out in the second quarter, RPIX inflation is a little weaker than in the earlier projection:  the combination of lower non-oil commodity prices, a higher exchange rate and slower earnings growth more than offset the impact of higher oil (1) Also shown as Chart 2 in the Overview.  Prospects for inflation 51 prices.  Inflation may fall below target for a time.  As the temporary effect of the higher exchange rate on imported inflation fades, lower interest rates and slightly stronger prospective output growth than in February underpin the rise in inflation to the target level in early 2001. Risks to activity are relatively evenly balanced throughout the forecast period, as the Committee judges that global prospects are no longer weighted to the downside around the central projection.  A possible fall in equity prices is a downside risk for activity;  the possibilities that sterling could be weaker and that stockbuilding could be stronger are counterbalancing upside risks.  The risks to inflation are slightly on the upside in both years:  the possibility that the exchange rate falls more than implied by interest rate differentials is the main factor.  However, some Committee members see greater downside risks to inflation from a stronger exchange rate profile, weaker world activity and prices, and greater pressure on margins, than assumed in the central projection.  Charts 6.4 and 6.5 show the overall balance of risks to inflation at the two-year horizon. Table 6.A presents the MPC’s judgment of the probabilities of various outcomes for inflation and GDP growth.

Inflation Report:  May 1999 52 The market expectation of the likely path of interest rates has risen slightly since the February Report.  On  5 May, implied interest rates on short-sterling futures contracts suggested that the market expectation was, on balance, for official rates to remain close to current levels or a little below in the near term.  There were some expectations of a small rise in rates in 2000.  So the MPC’s projections for inflation and output growth under the assumption that official rates follow market expectations are almost identical to the constant rate projection (see Charts 6.6 and 6.7).

Prospects for inflation 53 6.3 Other forecasts Chart 6.8 shows the distribution of central forecasts for the twelve-month rate of RPIX inflation in 2001 Q2, based on information gathered from 26 forecasters surveyed by the Bank in late April.  The mean forecast for the year to 1999 Q4 was 2.2%, rising to 2.3% in 2000 Q4, and reaching 2.4% in 2001 Q2.  The estimates for 1999 and 2000 are slightly higher than the projections made at the time of the January survey.  The forecasters assign a 45% probability to inflation being above the target in the second quarter of 2001, and a 55% probability to it being below (see Table 6.B). These estimates have changed slightly since the February Report, with more weight being placed on higher outturns for inflation. The forecasters’ average projection for GDP growth in the year to 1999 Q4 is 11/4% (with a range of projections from 1/4% to 21/4%), rising to 3% in the year to 2001 Q2 (with a range of 2% to 33/4%).  The mean projections are both half a percentage point higher than in January.  The forecasters on average assign a 9% probability to output growth falling below zero in the year to 1999 Q4, compared with 20% at the time of the January survey. The implications of the latest projections for the stance of monetary policy are discussed in the Overview at the beginning of the Report.

The international environment:  activity 2 The Committee’s interest rate reductions over the past few months had been heavily influenced by a weakening international environment.  In preparing its February Inflation Report, it had assessed the cumulative news since its November projections. 3 The strength of the US economy continued to surprise.  The official estimate of GDP growth in 1998 Q4 was significantly higher than the Committee had been expecting.  The longer such strong growth persisted, the greater the risk that the economy would encounter capacity constraints and rising inflationary pressures, but so far US inflation had remained low.  There was also a risk of a negative shock to demand.  The strength in the US stock market, and therefore household wealth, was obviously contributing to buoyant consumption, encouraging low private sector savings out of income.  The outlook was vulnerable to the possibility of a sharp equity market correction.  It was also possible that the increasing trade deficit associated with such strong demand growth would intensify trade policy tensions, although it had to be recognised that the US economy was operating at or above capacity overall.  Any possible trade tensions might be ameliorated by the recent appreciation of the yen, although that potentially exacerbated the weakness of aggregate demand in Japan.  While continuing robust US demand growth was possible in the short run and was helping to sustain global activity, the balance of risks in the medium term was on the downside. 4 The prospects for the global economy would be better if there were a more positive outlook for demand growth in the euro area.  While consumer confidence indicators were quite strong, measures of industrial sentiment were weak.  It was not clear whether this reflected recent weakness in activity growth, or whether it was a leading indicator of further output weakness. Possible explanations for the fall in business confidence in continental Europe included the cumulative effects of the emerging market economy crises on export markets and import competition; and uncertainty about economic policies.  There seemed to be divergent views in the euro area on the importance of supply-side policies, including structural reform of labour markets;  and on the desirable mix of fiscal and monetary policy.  A related area of uncertainty was the prospective policy response of the European Central Bank (ECB) if the outlook for demand remained sluggish. Some commentators had speculated that as long as inflation (as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices) was in the range 0%–2%, the ECB’s definition of price stability, ECB interest rate policy would be in a ‘zone of inaction’;  ie that the ECB might not respond to expected changes in inflation so long as it was set to remain in that range.  Uncertainty about ECB policy at this early point was probably inevitable.  It was also noted that the outlook in some of the smaller EMU countries was more buoyant than in Germany, France and Italy;  and that the ECB’s figures for the three-month centred average of the annual rate of growth of euro area broad money remained slightly above its 4.5% reference rate. 5 Japan remained a concern, with the recession likely to last longer than thought earlier and with the balance of risks in the short run on the downside.  There were some positive signs that policymakers would tackle the structural problems in the financial sector.  If embarked upon with determination, this would not only be beneficial in itself but might also give a positive signal about policy more generally, and so help to restore confidence.  In addition, a consequence of the long recession was that corporate balance sheets were also generally weak, so that financial sector reform—while necessary and important—might well not be sufficient to restore growth. 6 In the emerging market economies, the main event since the Committee’s January meeting had been the floating of the Brazilian real, and the questions which that had raised about Brazil’s monetary policy and about fiscal sustainability given the structure of its domestic and external debt.  So far direct spillover effects seemed to have been small, perhaps because the float had been discounted by markets.  The spread of the yield on emerging market US $ bonds over US Treasury Bond yields had, however, risen back towards the highs seen shortly after Russia’s default in  mid-1998.  The situation remained fragile. 7 Taking these developments together, the Committee agreed that the recent news about the international environment underlined its concerns about the world economic outlook, rather than substantially shifted its view compared with a month ago.  In particular, the Committee remained concerned about the current and prospective imbalances in the global economy.  Given reduced net capital flows to many emerging market economies, the industrialised world probably needed to stimulate domestic demand, to help offset weaker net trade, if world demand growth was to be sustained.  So far, with domestic demand very weak in Japan and sluggish in the euro area, the United States had effectively been acting as ‘consumer of last resort’.  But it was uncertain how long that could last, given the already prolonged period of above-trend growth in the United States.  While the balance of risks to activity in Japan was on the downside in the short run but possibly on the upside in the medium run, it was probably the other way round in the United States.  The industrialised world therefore faced a formidable challenge in balancing current and prospective aggregate world demand with potential supply.  It would be difficult to manage the scale and timing of any adjustments to domestic demand;  and industrial countries would need to accept larger current account deficits (or smaller surpluses) while domestic demand was stimulated.  The process might in principle be helped by exchange-rate adjustments amongst the major floating currencies, but this was highly uncertain in practice. The international environment:  prices 8 Against this background, the Committee debated the proposition that the world economy could conceivably be on a path to generalised price deflation.  The prices of a range of internationally traded goods and services had been falling. Evidence from further along the price chain could be seen in UK manufacturing input and output prices:  following a fall of nearly 9% in the twelve months to December, input prices were down to the level prevailing in 1986, and output price growth (which reflected labour costs as well as input prices) had been flat for the first time since 1960.  The risk of domestic inflation expectations falling sharply could, on this view, be exacerbated by the coincidence of weak world prices with the prospect of the RPI falling to historically low levels on account of the recent reductions in mortgage interest rates.   9 A number of arguments were made against the prospect of global price deflation.  First, the prices of some higher-value-added internationally traded goods and services were still rising.  Second, Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 3–4 February 1999  Inflation Report:  May 1999 58 the path of sterling input prices over the past couple of years had been affected by sterling’s large appreciation from August 1996. Third, many G7 central banks were pursuing de facto inflation targets (ie annual increases in average prices) of around 2%;  for example, the UK’s target was 21/2% and the ECB defined price stability as 0%–2%.  Achieving sustained low inflation was consistent with—indeed probably required—falls in the nominal price of some goods and services while those of others rose, reflecting for example different rates of productivity growth in different sectors, and/or shifting patterns of relative demand.  Not all firms could rely on rises in the nominal price of their products and some might have to accept that their prices would normally be falling;  but, given the UK’s poor inflationary record over the  past 25 years or so, it might take time for this to be reflected in firms’ behaviour.  Fourth, money growth in the United States  and in Europe remained reasonably strong.  In the medium to  long run central banks should be able to determine the average  rate of inflation, and the average rate of money growth was a reasonable broad indicator of the trend rate of increase of nominal variables. 10 Overall, the Committee agreed that in the short term there were downside risks to UK domestic prices from weaker than expected world prices.  Judgments on the extent of this risk varied. Monetary conditions 11 Sterling’s effective exchange rate had not changed much over the past month.  The Committee noted that its recent interest rate reductions had not been accompanied by a fall in sterling. 12 Inflation expectations, as measured by surveys, had fallen further over the past month.  It was suggested that they might now be better anchored around the 21/2% target. 13 The recent trend in the broad money numbers had been more comforting than during much of 1998.  Annual growth in December was 8.1%, and the three and six-month growth rates slightly lower.  M4 lending growth had also eased back.  Much of the recent fall had been accounted for by the Other Financial Companies sector, and it was too early to tell whether this simply reflected a larger-than-usual seasonal shrinking of balance sheets around the year-end.  Household broad money growth, at around 61/2%, was higher in December than during most of 1998. 14 Unsecured consumer credit taken out by the household sector had continued to grow strongly.  However, it appeared possible that over the past few years this had mirrored lower borrowing via mortgage equity withdrawal, which had been negative since the early 1990s.  Work by Bank staff suggested that there had not been a marked change in the relationship between consumption and total borrowing for consumption (as measured by unsecured borrowing plus mortgage equity withdrawal). 15 Overall, the Committee judged that, since its November projections were finalised, the upside risks to inflation from cumulatively strong money growth had eased;  and that there was a smaller risk of sterling depreciating by more than implied by interest rate differentials. Domestic demand:  household balance sheets and consumption 16 The Committee noted that the preliminary estimate of 0.2% GDP growth in 1998 Q4 was consistent with the degree of slowdown expected in its November central projection.  Some members had feared lower growth, and the possibility of revisions remained.  Surveys suggested that consumer and business sentiment had stopped deteriorating and had perhaps improved slightly, possibly helped by the 150 basis point reduction in official interest rates since October.  The preliminary data on Q4 expenditure suggested, however, that household spending might have grown by less in relation to income and wealth than the Committee had assumed in November. 17 In this context, the Committee discussed the household sector balance sheet.  The ratio of debt-to-net worth was lower than in recent cycles, but this was in part attributable to high equity prices, and so was potentially vulnerable to a fall in the stock market, which among other things might be triggered by a fall in the US market.  The ratio of debt service charges-to-household income was also low by recent standards, although this largely reflected low nominal interest rates.  On the other hand, the  debt-to-income ratio was quite high.  Overall the Committee did not regard this as a material concern:  the personal sector had increased its debt following the financial liberalisations of the 1980s, so that earlier periods were not a good guide.  On this view, the state of household balance sheets was unlikely to provide an explanation for the weaker-than-expected consumption. 18 The Committee noted that some savers had been adversely affected by the fall in interest rates.  Some commentators had argued that this would reduce aggregate demand.  A number of observations were made about this.  The fall in medium-long run nominal interest rates—for example conventional gilt yields— largely reflected quite a large fall in expected inflation.  The earlier higher nominal yields had been compensating for the erosion, via inflation, of the real value of their wealth, so that households may in the past have been consuming part of the real capital value of their investment.  They could continue to do so in a low inflation environment, but this would mean realising part of their investment rather than spending from high nominal income receipts.  It was possible that not all savers understood this, in which case lower nominal rates on savings products might have had a small dampening affect on consumption.  But it was unclear why this inflation illusion should influence savers more than borrowers. 19 Against this background and its earlier discussions on this broad issue (reported in the minutes of its December meeting), the Committee noted that it had decided, in preparing its latest projections, to make some allowance for the possibility that consumption growth over the forecast period might not offset the weaker-than-expected outturns of the past few quarters. Conditions in labour and product markets 20 The outlook for conditions in the labour market was very uncertain.  In particular, the recent rate of earnings growth was unusually uncertain, given the continued absence of the Average Earnings Index;  and it was unclear why measured productivity growth had recently been below trend. 21 As regards earnings growth, the Committee considered the outlook for pay settlements and for wage drift (the difference between earnings growth and settlements).  Settlements had been fairly stable since the middle of 1998;  and an informal survey undertaken by the Bank’s regional Agents had recorded that more firms expected settlements in 1999 to be below the 1998 level than expected them to be above:  wage drift also seemed likely to moderate.  Average hours worked had in fact already fallen, so there had probably been a fall in overtime payments.  The Reward Index was suggesting that earnings growth had been slowing.  The Working Time Directive and the National Minimum Wage were, by contrast, likely to put upward pressure on labour costs.  The Committee noted that lower growth in nominal earnings than previously expected would be consistent with the fall in  survey-based measures of inflation expectations.  The Committee also received an oral progress report on the independent review, commissioned by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, of the official Average Earnings Index.  No figures were yet available for the Committee, but the indications were that the review would not be inconsistent at least with the starting point for the path of nominal earnings growth assumed by the Committee.  Monetary Policy Committee 59 22 Some members of the Committee were concerned about  the potential knock-on effects from the recently announced settlements for public sector workers.  Other members thought  that, with a reasonably integrated labour market, the public sector could be expected to settle close to the economy-wide average over time. 23 The Committee agreed to incorporate a materially lower profile for nominal earnings growth in its February projection compared with November, although its central projection was still above the average of outside forecasts. 24 There was considerable uncertainty about recent and prospective growth in productivity, and so in unit labour costs. Employment having risen strongly over the past few years, productivity growth had, at around 11/2% annually, been significantly below trend.  The various possible explanations had quite different implications for the outlook for inflation.  One possibility was simply mismeasurement.  A second was that firms thought the slowdown in activity growth would not last long so that, given the costs of adjusting the size of their labour forces, they were content to employ more people than needed for current activity levels;  ie they were hoarding labour.  That would mean current levels of employment exaggerated the degree of capacity utilisation at present.  Correcting for this would imply lower margins and inflationary pressures. 25 A third possibility was that as unemployment had fallen so had productivity growth, through people entering the workforce into lower productivity jobs, with lower pay, following the various structural reforms to the labour market.  In that case, productivity would be expected to grow in the future at its past trend rate but starting from a lower average level.  Productive capacity, at any particular level of employment, would in that case be lower than implied by previous relationships.  This would have less benign implications for inflation than the labour hoarding explanation. 26 The Committee agreed to give some weight to each of these possible explanations in its central projection.  However, some members did not attach weight to the third possible explanation, pointing to recent robust growth in labour productivity in the United States despite very low unemployment there;  excluding it would reduce the central projection for inflation by around  0.2 percentage points. The MPC’s February projections 27 The Committee reviewed its projections, which were described more fully in the Inflation Report published in the week following the meeting. 28 Output growth was expected to fall during 1999 but to recover during 2000, partly reflecting planned increases in public sector spending.  As in November, the balance of risks to activity was on the downside over the whole of the forecast period.  The shape of the central projection for inflation was broadly flat over most of the forecast period, rising slightly towards the two year horizon.  The balance of risks to inflation was slightly on the upside until the middle of the year 2000 and then slightly on the downside. Uncertainty about the projections (ie the variance) had been adjusted to reflect the continuing suspension of the Average Earnings Index. 29 For any given level of interest rates, the level of the projections for both output growth and inflation was lower than in November.  The main changes to the output projection were lower consumption and the weaker outlook for world demand and UK exports.  The inflation projection was also affected by the lower path assumed for nominal earnings growth.  If interest rates were left at 6%, both the central projection for inflation and the average projection (taking account of the balance of risks)—ie both the mode and the mean—were materially below the 21/2% inflation target.  The projections therefore pointed towards a further reduction in interest rates. 30 The Committee discussed the predictions of a sample of outside forecasters.  The median forecast for inflation was around 21/2% in 2001 Q1.  It was possible that this simply reflected a belief that the Committee would pursue a policy that would succeed in achieving the 21/2% target at that horizon.  The assumptions of outside forecasters about interest rates were also likely to differ from the constant rate assumption used in the Bank’s own projections. 31 The Committee noted that the level of short term interest rates implied by financial markets fell to around 5% by the end of 1999.  Using market interest rates in the Bank’s projections implied that both the central projection for inflation and the average projection (taking account of the risks) would be above the 21/2% target from the middle of 1999, and materially so by the end of the two year forecast horizon. The immediate policy decision 32 The Committee discussed whether its latest projections for GDP growth and inflation had implications for the timing of any policy changes.  In particular, should any further reductions in interest rates be made quickly given that the most significant weakness in activity was expected over the next six months? Would cuts now endanger the inflation outlook over the medium run given that towards the end of the forecast period output growth was expected to reach trend and inflation to be rising?  The Committee agreed that various time paths for interest rates would be consistent with achieving the inflation target.  Its central projection was for the annual rate of output growth to be below trend for the next six quarters, so that an immediate easing of policy could stimulate activity and reduce downward pressures on inflation in the short run without causing an overshoot of the target over the medium run.  Policy might then have to be tightened at some point in the coming two years if output growth recovered as expected, but that could not yet be judged, and it did not need to be. 33 Against that background, there was agreement that interest rates needed to be reduced again.  A 25 basis point reduction, taking the Bank’s repo rate to 5.75% would leave the central projection below target throughout the second year of the forecast period.  A 50 basis point reduction, to 5.5%, would bring the central projection broadly into line with the target throughout the forecast period.  At the two year horizon, the central projection would be just a little above the target;  the average projection (taking account of the balance of risks) would still be slightly below target.  It was noted that some of the risks reflected in the forecast were of a kind to which the Committee could respond if and when they materialised.  Setting aside risks of this kind, the average rate of inflation at the end of forecast horizon with constant 5.5% official interest rates was also close to the target.  These considerations pointed towards a 50 basis point reduction. 34 A second argument made in favour of 50 basis points was that it would provide a degree of insurance against some of the downside risks.  In particular, the international outlook looked slightly more fragile than a month ago, and there was a risk of labour market pressures proving materially weaker than assumed in the Committee’s projections. 35 A third argument for 50 basis points was that any consequential fall in sterling would be helpful in alleviating the continuing imbalances in the economy, without endangering achievement of the inflation target. 36 One view was that at this point of the economic cycle interest rates should be close to, or possibly below, their ‘neutral’ level;  ie, providing neither stimulus nor constraint to the economy. While that level could not be stimulated with great accuracy, a  Inflation Report:  May 1999 60 reduction of 50 basis points, on this view, would take the nominal short term rate into its probable neutral range.  Three reasons were given why, on this view, a reduction of more than 50 basis points might be needed.  First, it might already be too late to stop RPIX inflation falling materially below target over the next year.  In that case, a larger cut would help to anchor inflation expectations closer to the target over the medium run.  Second, it was plausible, judging from the reports of the Bank’s regional Agents and from surveys, that earnings growth would be lower in 1999 than in 1998, contrary to the assumption used in the Committee’s central projection.  Third, the Committee’s inflation projection did not place enough weight on the possibility of world price inflation being weaker than assumed.  However, evidence on each of these uncertainties would materialise over the next few months, and a larger than 50 basis point reduction now might unsettle financial markets.  On this view, therefore, a cut of 50 basis points was the right step for now. 37 On another view, there were arguments for a reduction of 75–100 basis points.  First, the central projection for inflation was around 0.2 percentage points too high because the level of productivity would be higher than assumed for the reasons explained in paragraph 26.  The average (ie mean) projection for inflation, should also be lower both for that reason and also because of the possibility of weaker world prices.  Second, given that monetary policy was expected generally to affect activity growth with a shorter lag than it affected inflation, it would be possible to ease policy by more than 50 basis points now with a view to supporting activity in the relatively near term without endangering achievement of the inflation target.  On this view, these two factors together made a reduction in the range 75–100 basis points desirable. 38 The Governor invited members of the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate be cut by 0.50% to 5.5%. Eight members of the Committee (the Governor, Mervyn King, David Clementi, Alan Budd, Charles Goodhart, DeAnne Julius, Ian Plenderleith and John Vickers) voted for the proposition.  Willem Buiter voted against, preferring a cut of 0.75%. 39 The following members of the Committee were present: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Alan Budd Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers 40 Andrew Turnbull was present as the Treasury representative.  Monetary Policy Committee 61 1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by the Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee on 29 January 1999, in advance of its meeting on 3–4 February 1999.  At the start of the Committee meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and that information is included in the Annex. I Monetary conditions 2 Notes and coin had risen by 0.6% in January and the annualised three and six-month growth rates had picked up to 7.1% and 6.1% respectively, after adjusting for the effects of the introduction of the 50p and £2 coins.  However, new estimates of seasonal factors had led to the December monthly growth rate being revised down from 1.2% to 0.6%.  In the past, there had been some correlation between monthly changes in notes and coin and current and future changes in the value of retail sales. 3 The twelve-month growth rate of M4 had been 8.1% in December, the lowest since June 1995.  Annualised three and  six-month growth rates had been below the twelve-month rate.  The slowdown had been driven by other financial corporations (OFCs): the twelve-month growth rate of OFCs’ M4 in 1998 Q4 had been 16.0%, the lowest since 1995 Q2.  This figure could have reflected a temporary contraction of OFCs’ balance sheets at the end of the financial year.   4 Households’ M4 growth had continued to pick up in  1998 Q4.  The three-month annualised growth rate in the quarter had been 9.0%, the highest since 1997 Q1, and the six-month annualised rate of 8.1% had been the highest since 1997 Q2. 5 The £0.2 billion fall in private non-financial corporations’ (PNFCs’) deposits during 1998 Q4 had been the first fall since  1995 Q2.  The twelve-month growth rate had fallen to 3.5% in Q4 from 5.2% in Q3.  Firms may have been using bank deposits as a form of ‘buffer stock’ to smooth fluctuations in cashflows as they adjusted to changes in demand. 6 M4 lending had also continued to slow in December.  The twelve-month rate, at 7.5%, had been the lowest since April 1995, while the three and six-month annualised growth rates had remained below the twelve-month growth rate.  As with M4, the slowdown had been led by OFCs.  The twelve-month growth rate of OFCs lending had fallen to 9.7% in 1998 Q4, down by  6.0 percentage points from 1998 Q3, and the lowest level since 1994 Q3.  As with their M4 deposits, contraction of financial institutions’ balance sheets at the year end had contributed to weak OFCs’ lending in Q4. 7 M4 lending to the household sector had remained firm in 1998 Q4, growing by 7.5% on a year earlier.  Within the comprehensive measure of lending to individuals, the growth of secured lending had been steady at 5.9%, despite a slowdown in the housing market.  Growth in unsecured lending had remained high in Q4, at 16.3%. 8 The recent strength of unsecured lending contrasted with the relative weakness of consumption.  One interpretation was that this was a shift from other forms of borrowing such as mortgage equity withdrawal.  Wider measures of consumer borrowing, which included equity withdrawal, had continued to show a closer relationship with consumption in recent quarters. 9 The twelve-month growth rate of M4 lending to PNFCs had picked up in 1998 Q4 (by 0.5 percentage points, to 6.4%), although the three and six-month growth rates had remained below the twelve-month rate.  Total external borrowing by PNFCs in Q4 had fallen slightly, by £0.3 billion to £7.3 billion, mainly reflecting lower net capital issues in foreign currency. 10 Banks and building societies had announced further cuts to standard variable mortgage rates following the reduction in official rates in January.  Mortgage rates had been reduced by the full  150 basis point cut in the repo rate since October.  Credit card rates had fallen again in December, especially among long-established lenders.  This was indicative of competition from new entrants in the market. 11 Inflation expectations for 1999 as measured by surveys of professional forecasters, conducted by Consensus Economics (forecasts of average 1999 RPIX inflation), HM Treasury (forecasts of 1999 Q4 RPIX inflation) and the Merrill Lynch survey of fund managers (forecasts of RPIX inflation in the year to December 1999) had remained largely unchanged in January, and were between 20 and 40 basis points below the Bank’s inflation target. Inflation expectations for 2000, measured by the same institutions and on the same basis, had all been 2.2%.  The Merrill Lynch survey had been conducted prior to the cut in the repo rate on  6 January. 12 Estimates of short real rates had been made by subtracting the Merrill Lynch survey measure of inflation expectations from the corresponding-maturity wholesale money-market rate.  This calculation had suggested that the one-year real forward rate for 2000 had fallen during December, by around 20 basis points.  II Demand and output 13 GDP had risen by 0.2% in 1998 Q4 and by 1.6% compared with a year ago.  Service sector output had grown by 0.6%, compared with 0.8% in Q3.  December manufacturing output data had not yet been published, but in the three months to November, output had fallen by 1.1%.  Car production had fallen by almost 4% in 1998 H2 compared with 1998 H1:  production for export markets had risen by 7%, whereas production for home markets had declined by 17%.  But there had been anecdotal reports that export orders for cars were falling.  Within services, distribution, hotels and catering output had been flat in Q4. 14 Retail sales volumes had fallen sharply in December, by 0.9%, more than reversing November’s rise.  In Q4 overall, sales volumes had fallen by 0.2%, the first quarterly fall since 1992 Q3. The annual growth rate had stood at 1.4% in Q4.  The underlying trend in retail sales growth had still been downward. 15 Quarterly growth in retail sales and National Accounts data for spending on retail goods had not always been consistent.  For example, there were different surveys for food.  And car registrations data had implied a rise in spending on cars in Q4.   It was possible that, overall, consumption growth in Q4 had not been as weak as the retail sales data suggested. 16 Surveys for plant and machinery investment had continued to indicate a slowdown in investment growth.  The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) Industrial Trends and British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) surveys for Q4 had indicated that, on balance, manufacturers had intended to reduce investment, though there had been some easing in the CBI survey balance (from -32 to -21).  The BCC survey balance for the service sector had continued to show positive investment intentions, though the balance had fallen from +27 in Q2 to +17 in Q4.  Around 50% of whole-economy investment tended to be accounted for by investment in buildings. And construction new orders had been rising during 1998. Annex:  Summary of data presented by Bank staff  Inflation Report:  May 1999 62 17 The CBI survey had suggested that although manufacturers had sharply reduced their stocks of finished goods in Q4—the balance had fallen to -14 from +3—stocks had remained high relative to expected demand.  An unwinding of stocks had been consistent with falling manufacturing output in Q4.  The CBI Distributive Trades survey had also indicated that retail stocks had remained excessive relative to demand in December. 18 The total goods trade deficit had widened in November, mainly because of a deterioration in the non-EU balance.  The total deficit in the three months to November had been £6.3 billion, the highest since October 1989.  In December, the non-EU goods deficit had narrowed slightly.  For 1998 as a whole, the non-EU goods deficit had been a record £15.7 billion;  the value of exports to South East Asia had fallen by 27%, and the value of imports from that region had risen by 3%.  Total goods export volumes (excluding oil and erratics) had been falling—by 2.2% in the three months to November—whereas import volumes had risen by 2.7%. The fall in exports had been largely explained by cars and other consumer goods.  The CBI export orders balances had recovered a little in Q4, but still pointed to falling export volumes. 19 The Halifax house price index had risen by 0.5% in January, after having fallen by 0.1% in December, taking the annual inflation rate to 4.4% from 4.5%.  The Nationwide index had risen by 1.4% in January, with annual inflation up to 7.4% from 7.0% in December.  Activity as measured by particulars delivered had been 8% down in the three months to December on the previous three months, and leading indicators of housing market transactions had pointed to flat or falling transactions in the coming months.  New house-building activity had also remained weak, though the House Builders’ Federation survey reported that nearly two thirds of builders planned to increase starts in 1999.  20 GfK consumer confidence had risen in January.  But the survey balance was not seasonally adjusted, and tended to rise in January.  It had remained negative (-2.2) and below its level a year earlier.  The divergence between consumers’ perceptions about the general economic situation and their own financial situation, which had emerged in mid 1998, had remained evident.  Consumers had still expected the general economic situation to deteriorate, but had expected their own situation to improve. 21 Companies had appeared to be in a stronger financial situation than they were in the late 1980s-early 1990s.  An examination of the distribution of gearing across quoted companies had suggested that most of these companies should have been able to service their debt with relative ease.  And the market valuation of the corporate sector had suggested that future profits would also be high relative to the interest costs of servicing debt.  But income gearing had been rising, and (possibly associated with that) the rate of insolvencies had begun to increase. 22 The deterioration in manufacturing survey balances for orders and expected orders had eased:  the CBI export optimism balance had risen to -18, from -41 in 1998 Q3 and a low of -50 in Q2.  But they had still pointed to a decline in manufacturing output in 1999 Q1.  Supporting this, the Chartered Institute of Purchasing Supply (CIPS) manufacturing output index for January was 42.3: below the 50 ‘no change’ level.  The BCC home orders balance for the service sector had declined further in 1998 Q4, from +11 to +5, suggesting a further slowdown in service sector output growth in 1999 Q1.  But the BCC survey had also indicated that the balance of firms in the manufacturing and service sector that had been operating at or above full capacity in 1998 Q4 had been relatively high. III International environment 23 In the United States, GDP had risen by 1.4% in Q4. Consumers’ confidence about current conditions had risen in January, but expectations of future conditions had continued to fall. Non-farm payrolls had risen sharply in December, keeping employment growth at 2.3% on a year earlier.  However, there continued to be sharp sectoral differences:  employment had been falling from month to month in manufacturing for most of 1998, while growth in the rest of economy was still robust.  Capacity utilisation had fallen slightly in November.  Survey measures of slack had also pointed downwards.  24 The trade deficit had widened to $15.5 billion in November, but the trend over recent months had been unclear.  The overall consumer price index had increased 1.6% on a year ago in December.  The difference in goods and service price inflation had persisted.  This had partly reflected differences in labour cost inflation.  The Employment Cost Index for services had risen more sharply than for manufacturing in 1998. 25 In Europe, recent production data had been stronger and consumption data had been weaker, somewhat against the recent trend.  French industrial production had risen by 1.0% in November and by 0.7% in October.  Italian industrial production had shown a stronger trend, but November production had fallen by 1.5% on a month ago.  German industrial production had fallen by 2.2% in November, and manufacturing orders had pointed to a further sharp slowdown in the coming months.  German GDP in the fourth quarter had probably fallen.  French household consumption had fallen in December for the third consecutive month.  Industrial confidence in the euro area had fallen to -9 in December, from -8 in November and +1 in December 1997.  Consumer confidence had risen in December in most countries, although not in Spain or Germany.  Euro-area HICP fell to 0.8% in December.  26 In Japan, the Economic Planning Agency had expected positive GDP growth in the fourth quarter, resulting from increases in private consumption, public investment and net trade.  But despite discounting by retailers, Japanese retail sales had remained weak in December.  Employment had continued to fall in manufacturing and the construction sectors, though public works spending had slowed the fall in construction.  Central government new construction orders had increased from September onwards, but they had been more than offset by the contraction in local government new orders.  Industrial production had risen strongly in December.  But for 1998 as a whole, industrial production had fallen by 6.9%, the largest fall since 1975.  Inventory levels and the inventory/shipments ratio had both fallen in December.  Overall, there had been little evidence of a recovery in private sector activity.  Bank lending had continued to decline at record rates, the outlook for consumption had remained weak, and public works spending had remained ineffective. 27 The Consensus Economics mean forecast for Japanese GDP growth had fallen by 0.5 percentage points to -1.1% for 1999;  for US GDP growth, it had been revised up, from 2.3% in December to 2.4% in January;  and for GDP growth in Germany in 1999, it had fallen from 2.0% to 1.8%. Emerging markets 28 The devaluation and subsequent float of the Brazilian real had resulted in a 32% depreciation against the US dollar between 12 January and 3 February.  Short-term interest rates had been increased by just over 9% since the devaluation, to 39%. 29 The more pessimistic scenarios that had been discussed in the market assumed financial contagion from Brazil to a much wider range of countries.  There had been evidence of pressure on fixed exchange rates in, for example, Argentina and Hong Kong, but not as yet a wider impact such as that which had followed the Russian default.  The pre-EU accession countries in central Europe had been in a position to borrow externally and to ease monetary policy.  The Asian crisis countries (except Indonesia) had had some, albeit limited, access to external funds, in some cases with the guarantee of Japan or the World Bank.  Nevertheless, the  Monetary Policy Committee 63 external financing prospects of emerging countries in aggregate had continued to deteriorate.  IV The labour market 30 LFS employment had grown by 98,000 (0.4%) in the three months to November, compared with the previous three months, consistent with the Workforce jobs growth figure, released in the previous month, of a rise of 97,000 in the three months to September.  The increase in LFS employment had been largely accounted for by a large rise in employees, but self-employment had also risen, ending the steep decline earlier in the year.  The total number of hours worked had risen more slowly than employment (by 0.1% in the three months to November), implying a fall in the number of hours worked per person, consistent with the increase in LFS employment over this period being concentrated in part-time jobs.  Hours worked per person were 0.8% lower than a year earlier.     31 Strong increases in employment had contrasted with survey evidence.  The CIPS manufacturing and construction surveys for January had suggested that employment was continuing to fall.  The CIPS services survey for January had suggested that employment was now falling in services too.  Forward-looking surveys had suggested that this pattern might persist.  The BCC services survey for Q4 had shown that employment intentions were broadly unchanged, while the manufacturing balance had become more negative.  The CBI manufacturing survey balance had also become more negative, to its lowest level since 1992 Q3.  The Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services survey had also suggested that the demand for employees was falling. 32 The number of new notifications at job centres had fallen by 3,500 in December, while the stock of vacancies had fallen by 3,900.  The National Press Recruitment Advertising index had stabilised in recent months.  The BCC survey for Q4 had suggested that recruitment difficulties in manufacturing and services had eased slightly.  But the CBI Industrial Trends survey for Q4 showed a small rise in expected skill shortages in manufacturing in the next few months.  33 Both of the main measures of unemployment had fallen on the latest data.  LFS unemployment had decreased by 26,000 in the three months to November.  The LFS unemployment rate had been unchanged from the three months to October, at 6.2%.   Claimant-count unemployment had fallen by 14,000 in December to its lowest level since June 1980, though the rate had also remained unchanged, at 4.6%.  There had been little sign of increased redundancies in the claimant-count inflow numbers, while the exit rate from unemployment had remained high. 34 Labour market inactivity had not seemed to be following a normal cyclical pattern.  It had been increasing in the first half of 1998, but had reversed since June.  According to the LFS, inactivity had fallen by a further 33,000 in the three months to November. The fall in inactivity in this period had been smaller than in recent months and, in an accounting sense, this had explained why the latest employment increase had—unlike those of recent months— been accompanied by a fall in unemployment. 35 There had been no new official earnings data:  the Average Earnings Index was still suspended.  The Reward index of  earnings growth had slowed further to 4.8% in December from 5.4% in June. 36 The twelve-month employment-weighted average settlements measure had remained flat in December, at 3.7%.  But most settlements tended to be concentrated between January and April.  Private and public sector settlements remained unchanged, at 4.0% and 3.3% respectively.  The three-month  employment-weighted mean increased from 3.8% in November to 4.1% in December, while the median fell from 3.8% to 3.7%. 37 Details of the settlements for public sector workers covered by the Pay Review Bodies had been announced on 1 February. Overall, the paybill of workers covered by the Review Bodies was to increase by 4.1% and the settlements would not be staged. 38 The Bank’s regional Agents had conducted an informal survey of contacts on the prospects for earnings growth in 1999.  Of the firms sampled that had a company-wide settlement, 46% had expected it to be lower in percentage terms in 1999 than in 1998. Only 13% of firms had expected their settlement to rise.  But 29% of firms had expected growth in total earnings per employee to be higher in 1999, with 38% expecting it to be lower. 39 The inflation outlook and company prospects, particularly in the manufacturing sector, were highlighted by these respondents as factors likely to depress earnings growth in 1999.  A majority had cited recruitment difficulties as an upward pressure on earnings growth.  Other widely quoted upward pressures had included productivity growth and bonuses, the latter reflecting increased use of performance-related pay across firms.  Some respondents had also mentioned the National Minimum Wage, the Working Time Directive and the phased end of Profit-Related Pay (PRP) tax benefits. V Prices 40 On the basis of provisional data, in the Bank’s index of commodity prices excluding oil had shown a small rise in December.  The annual rate of inflation had risen slightly to -6.2% from -6.3%, and the underlying growth rate (three months on a year earlier) had risen to -5.3%, the highest rate since August 1997. That had been driven by recent growth in UK agriculture prices and a slowdown in metals price deflation.  Nonetheless, market commentators had forecast a slight fall in commodity prices in 1999, before a pick-up in 2000.  Commodity prices including oil had continued to fall, by 2.5% in December, according to the Bank’s index. 41 Oil prices had risen to more than $12 per barrel at the beginning of January, following reports of a big fall in US oil inventories in the first week of December.  But, thereafter, markets had been subdued by profit-taking and the lack of further OPEC production cuts.  The price had fallen to $11.46 per barrel by  6 January. 42 Input prices had fallen again in December, by 1.2%, giving annual deflation of -8.9%.  Since their peak in September 1995, input prices had fallen by 22.4%, and prices were at a level last recorded in 1986.  Output prices excluding excise duties had been unchanged in December, giving annual deflation of -0.8%.  And total annual output price inflation had fallen to zero, its lowest rate since March 1960.  The CBI Industrial Trends survey had suggested a further fall in prices in January.   43 There had been no obvious reaction so far to sterling’s depreciation from export or import price inflation.  Total import prices from the world had fallen by 6.0% in the year to November (-7.0% to October), and total export prices to the world had fallen by 4.7% in the year to November (-5.5% to October). 44 RPI inflation had fallen by 0.2 percentage points to 2.8% in December.  RPIX inflation had risen by 0.1 percentage points to 2.6% in December;  RPIY inflation had risen by 0.2 percentage points to 2.0%.  Seasonal food had become the most inflationary sector in the RPI, as unfavourable weather had again affected supply.  Household goods prices had risen strongly, but over the past decade, household goods prices had risen in December and then fallen sharply in January ‘sales’.  The gap between goods and services price inflation had narrowed in December. 45 The only new data on other measures of inflation since the January MPC meeting had been on the retail sales deflator and the  Inflation Report:  May 1999 64 harmonised consumer prices index (HICP).  Retail sales deflator inflation had risen by 0.4 percentage points to 1.3% in December. HICP inflation had increased by 0.1 percentage points to 1.5%. The increase had been similar to RPIX and for the same reasons, but the 1.1 percentage point gap between the two inflation rates had remained unusually high.  The effect of using the geometric mean in calculating HICP inflation had continued to account for much of that difference.  The geometric mean effect had increased over the past decade, while inflation had declined. 46 The UK HICP had been 0.4 percentage points above the EU average in November.  Although UK goods price inflation had been below the EU average in November, UK services price inflation had been well above average.  VI Agents’ national summary 47 The Bank’s regional Agents gave their assessment of economic developments, drawn from discussions with contacts over the past month.  Construction output had continued to grow, boosted by Millennium, railway and public sector work, but growth had been expected to slow during the course of 1999, reflecting weaker orders.  Housing starts had remained subdued, but there had been some evidence of a recovery in the secondary housing market in certain regions.  Manufacturing contacts had continued to report falling output and excessive stocks, despite extended shutdowns in some areas.  Competition from cheaper imports had remained intense.  Further reductions in output had been expected in the first quarter of 1999, although there appeared to have been some recovery of manufacturing sentiment in some regions, reflecting an improvement in perceived export prospects.   48 Retailers had seen a late surge of sales before Christmas, and there had been quite a strong early start to the January ‘sales’.  But sales of most goods had subsequently fallen off, and most retail contacts still considered their stock levels to be excessive.  Sales of consumer services had continued to grow, but at lower rates than earlier in 1998.  Business service growth had remained strong in a number of regions. 49 Banks had been reporting lower demand for borrowing, as manufacturers deferred new investment plans.  And several of the Bank’s Agents had been told of a rise in late payments by small and medium-sized firms.  But there was some evidence that banks had been attempting to address credit problems more proactively and earlier than they had done in the previous cycle. 50 Manufacturing employment had continued to fall.  A spate of redundancy announcements in the durable goods sectors and elsewhere in recent weeks had yet to reach the official figures, and several firms had indicated that they would be reviewing employment levels again during the first quarter.  Services employment had continued to grow, but at a lower rate. VII Information from financial markets Foreign exchange 51 The sterling effective exchange rate index had appreciated by 1.1% since the 6–7 January MPC meeting and by 0.2% from the (15-day average) starting-point in the November Inflation Report. The central projection in the November Report had assumed a small depreciation over this period and so ‘news’ about the exchange rate amounted to a small appreciation.  But movements  in yield curves in the United Kingdom and overseas had suggested that news about monetary policy had not explained the most  recent appreciation.  Outside forecasts for sterling made at the  start of the year had been on average for a fall of nearly 4% in effective terms through 1999, slightly more than implied by forward rates.   52 Over the month as a whole, the dollar had strengthened markedly.  The appreciation of the euro at the start of its life had been short-lived;  soft data, particularly from Germany, had led to expectations of lower euro interest rates relative to those for the United States.  Initially, the dollar had also fallen sharply against the yen (to a low of ¥108.2 on 11 January), as further short yen positions had been squeezed out.  The floating of the Brazilian real had created some initial nervousness, but had had only limited impact on other currencies. Government bond and money markets 53 UK data and survey releases had raised slightly interest rates implied by the nearest short sterling contracts.  But the longer contracts and the UK bond market had rallied further.  Nominal and real gilt yields had been very low by historical standards and by comparison with other countries with similar or lower inflation. Recovering market confidence and low gilt yields had led to some recovery in non-government sterling bond issuance in the fourth quarter, but a significant proportion had been by supranational bodies.  The yield spread over gilts paid by credits below top quality remained high. 54 UK forward rates implied by gilt yields were below those implied by German government bond yields from five years out. However, forward rates from swap curves had shown  UK-German convergence at medium (7–10 year) maturities. Institutional demand for gilts and limited net issuance might have been having a material effect on gilt yields, pushing them below the level implied by expectations of future interest rates.  Equity and corporate debt markets 55 Although the Brazilian real float had had a positive impact on the local stock market, it had checked the recovery of equity prices in most major countries, though not in Japan.  In a number  of countries, including the United Kingdom, bank share prices  had both fallen absolutely and relative to general indices.   Credit spreads in bond markets and in the swaps market had generally fallen, particularly for lower-rated companies.   Spreads for UK bank bond yields over other UK corporates had also fallen. 56 Downward profit warnings by UK companies in January had again been more numerous than a year earlier.  Trading statements from some general retailers had adversely affected their share prices, although the sector as a whole had not fallen relative to the market.  Small company shares had continued to underperform. Underperformance had appeared cyclical.  Monetary Policy Committee 65 1 The Committee discussed the prospects for the world economy;  money and financial markets;  demand and output;  the implications of the Budget projections for the macroeconomic outlook;  the labour market;  prices;  and other considerations bearing on the decision this month, before turning to its immediate policy decision.  The world economy 2 Activity in the United States economy had again been stronger than expected over the past month.  Indeed, provisional estimates suggested it had contributed around half of the increase in world demand in 1998, well in excess of its 20% share of world output.  The National Association of Purchasing Managers (NAPM) index had strengthened—partly reflecting an improvement in export orders.  This was surprising given recent weakness in the world economy and the strength of the US dollar.  There were, perhaps, some parallels with the UK survey data.  However, the prospects for the US economy as a whole still seemed to be for slowing growth over coming quarters.  On balance, prospects for growth in the euro area had weakened over the month, but with considerable inter-regional variation.  The weak Q4 output data in Germany and Italy had more than counterbalanced some stronger than expected French data.  In Japan, there were now signs that financial restructuring was taking place but, in the short run, this might exacerbate the weakness in credit conditions.  The immediate prospects for activity there did not seem to have changed much over the past month.  Overall, there seemed to be little change in the prospects for UK export demand from developments in other major industrial economies. 3 The situation outside the OECD had not changed much over the past month.  There had been renewed difficulties in Brazil, and the real had weakened.  There was still a risk of contagion, but other major countries in South America were not obviously under pressure.  The lower oil price had already led to lower imports by the oil exporting countries and this could be seen in UK exports, but otherwise developments over the month were much as expected overall. Money and financial markets 4 Narrow money growth continued to be quite strong, and was possibly being influenced by the past reductions in interest rates. Broad money growth was continuing to ease, and it was noticeable that the shorter three and six-month annualised growth rates were below the twelve-month growth rate.  The risks from past rapid growth in broad money had diminished. 5 The sterling effective exchange rate was currently over 2% higher than the 15 day average used as the starting-point for the February Inflation Report projections.  The FT-SE All-Share index had risen by 2% since the February Report.  The rise in share prices was broadly based, with both the FT-SE 100 and Small Capitalisation indexes rising over the period.  This was in contrast with earlier periods when the FT-SE 100 had grown faster than the Small Capitalisation index. 6 The rise in the sterling effective exchange rate reflected the balance of two offsetting bilateral movements;  sterling had depreciated against the US dollar but had appreciated against the euro.  The implications for UK inflation would depend on the reasons for the changes.  Political and economic developments in the euro area probably accounted for some of the depreciation of the euro against the dollar and sterling over the past month.  It was possible that the weakening euro reflected the market’s expectation that prospects for euro-area demand and output growth were weaker than for the United States, and perhaps for the United Kingdom as well given the possibility of faster growth here in late 1999 and 2000.  There was evidence that the movement in interest rate differentials could account for some of the rise in sterling. 7 The rise in the exchange rate and in equity prices would have opposite effects on the central projection for inflation, but the movement in the exchange rate was thought to be the more significant of the two.  To the extent that sterling’s strength persisted it would increase the imbalance between the traded and non-traded sectors of the economy, and would require a strengthening of domestic demand if inflation were not to fall below target. Demand and output 8 The level of GDP in 1998 Q4 had been revised down by 1/4% since the preliminary output estimate available at the time of the February Inflation Report.  The expenditure composition had also been published, and this showed slightly weaker final domestic demand than assumed in the central projection.  The rise in inventories had also been stronger than expected, leaving domestic demand growth a little stronger overall.  But faster domestic demand growth had been offset by a larger negative contribution from net trade (primarily weaker exports), and so GDP growth in the fourth quarter was, at 0.2%, unchanged from the time of the February Report.  The statistical discrepancy between the expenditure and average measure of GDP was 0.6% in 1998 Q4. But due to the suspension of the Average Earnings Index there was no income measure of GDP available for Q4.  Within the output breakdown, the fall in construction output for the third successive quarter seemed surprising given recent orders and survey data. 9 Consumption growth had been revised down in 1998 Q3, but the level in Q4 was not materially different from that expected at the time of the Report.  Hence, the puzzle as to why consumption growth had weakened so much through 1997–8 remained.  Retail sales (around 40% of consumption) had recovered in January, but the underlying picture remained fairly weak.  Consumer confidence in January had risen for the third successive month on the GfK measure.  It was likely that the five reductions in interest rates since the autumn had played a material role in stabilising confidence, but it was difficult to be sure how robust the recent recovery was. More work was needed to understand how consumer confidence was affected by changes in interest rates.  There were also some signs of a pick-up in the housing market, particularly in the indicators which are at the start of the house buying process, such as House Builders Federation site visits and reservations.  There seemed little news in the latest house price figures. 10 The build-up in inventories appeared a little puzzling as it was not apparent in either the official manufacturing or retail distribution figures, where any signs of weaker than expected demand might be expected.  The rise in stocks in the fourth quarter—and for 1998 as a whole—had been concentrated in the ‘other industries’ sector, which included the quarterly alignment adjustment (between the expenditure and output measures of GDP). It was possible that this rise in stocks could partly reflect a change in the pattern of car registrations this year, which would not as yet be accounted for in the usual seasonal adjustment. 11 The news in the national accounts and recent surveys could be interpreted in several ways.  First, the lower level of GDP than in previous estimates, coupled with the build up of inventories, might point to a weaker picture for demand than previously thought.  In particular, the weaker outturn for exports in Q4, and the sharp fall in the volatile non-EU exports figure in January, Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 2–3 March 1999  Inflation Report:  May 1999 66 might point to some of the downside risks to external demand coming through.  But the changes in the composition and revisions to the level of GDP were not particularly large. 12 Second, the lower level of GDP, coupled with the latest survey data, raised the question of whether the low point in output growth might have come a little earlier than previously expected. 13 Third, the surveys, though generally remaining weak, had all been stronger over the past month.  That uniformity was somewhat surprising, and might indicate a slightly better picture than previously thought.  Some of the survey indicators were recovering towards levels recorded last summer, before the sharp deterioration occurred.  Of particular note had been the improvement in export orders in both the CBI and CIPS surveys over the past month.  So to the extent that the surveys had for a while been painting a weaker picture for exports than the ONS data, that gap now appeared to be closing. 14 Overall, the data did not significantly change the picture for demand and output.  The improvement in survey data might prove significant, but had yet to be seen in the official data. The forthcoming Budget 15 Prior to the meeting, the Committee was briefed by Treasury officials about the forthcoming Budget’s expenditure and revenue projections and macroeconomic forecasts, but not the detailed measures.  The overall fiscal position was reported to remain stable, and was in line with the assumptions in the February Inflation Report.  16 At the MPC meeting, the Committee briefly discussed the lower than planned Net Departmental Outlays seen in the first ten months of the 1998/99 fiscal year.  This was primarily related to social security rather than other government departments’ spending on goods and services.  But since the control framework was new this year, it was not known what would happen to spending at the end of the year:  departments had less of an incentive to spend their budgets in the final weeks of the fiscal year as they could carry spending forward to future years, which could have timing consequences for the pattern of real demand. Labour market 17 The Committee had been briefed by Mr King and by Bank staff before the meeting on the review of the Average Earnings Index, which was published on 2 March.  Earnings growth was now estimated to have reached a peak of 5.7% in May 1998, before falling back to 4.5% in November on the headline measure. Preliminary estimates of unit wage costs produced by Bank staff using the revised Average Earnings Index suggested a stronger picture for the first half of 1998 than previously thought, and a weaker picture in the second half of the year with the rate of change flat at around 33/4%. 18 The general pattern of earnings growth through 1998 was broadly consistent with the assumptions that had been made at the time of the February Inflation Report.  That gave the Committee members somewhat greater confidence in the starting assumptions for earnings growth than they had felt at the time of the Report. However, the pace of slowdown in earnings growth was more marked than had been assumed:  starting from a higher level and ending a little below the February assumption.  The level of earnings at the end of 1998 was close to that assumed in the projections.  A preliminary analysis suggested that after making a rough adjustment for hours worked, the profile of the growth of earnings per hour through the second half of the year was broadly flat.  Hence the rise and fall in the headline measure through 1998 was, perhaps, consistent with a higher, then lower, contribution from overtime.  More analysis of the new figures was needed, for example of the contribution of bonuses to earnings growth.  The fall in earnings growth through 1998 would need to be reconciled with the rise in employment and fall in unemployment over this period.  One possible explanation was the fall in inflation expectations discussed at previous meetings.  Among the recommendations made in the review of the AEI were a number of further improvements to the way the series was compiled to bring it up to best practice.  Hence the Committee concluded that it should not, as yet, place great weight on the index.  19 The Bank’s settlements series showed some signs that the peak might have been passed on the twelve-month employment weighted mean measure.  The Reward index had declined on a broadly similar path to the revised Average Earnings Index over 1998. 20 The Committee noted that its central projection for earnings growth remained towards the top end of the range of other forecasts, despite a broadly similar projection for inflation in these forecasts.  The Committee had discussed this during the February Inflation Report round in the context of recent movements in productivity.  It would be necessary to look at the reasons for the differences in projections of real earnings growth, and hence implied profit margins, in the light of the new earnings data. 21 The latest data continued to show rising employment and falling unemployment, though total hours worked had fallen in December.  The rise in employment was partly accounted for by an increase in the number of women in part-time employment.  Both the stock of vacancies and number of new vacancies seemed surprisingly high and seemed to bear out the picture in the employment and unemployment data, suggesting a still tight labour market.  But the latest Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services (FRES) survey showed that the job market index was at its lowest level since 1992.  The three CIPS surveys for manufacturing, construction and services all pointed to falling employment.  It seemed likely that a turning point would soon be seen in the official data. Prices 22 Non-oil commodity prices had risen in January in sterling terms.  There were tentative signs that the deflation might be coming to an end.  The level of commodity prices was still much lower than a year ago, but they would have to keep falling to lower the central projection for inflation compared with February. 23 Contacts of the Bank’s regional Agents were increasingly mentioning that consumers were more ‘price sensitive’ than previously.  The Committee discussed possible explanations for this.  The comment might simply reflect inflation illusion.  Lower inflation over recent years may have made it easier for people to distinguish movements in relative prices from general price inflation.  It seemed likely that the comments also reflected continuing structural changes in the retail industry, for example through a greater use of discount stores, which might be lowering margins.     24 The Committee also noted the rise in inflation expectations at longer maturities over the past month, as measured by the difference between implied forward interest rates on nominal and index linked bonds.  It was too early to place much weight on this movement, which was in any event small by historical standards. There had not been much movement in shorter-term survey-based measures of inflation expectations over the past month. 25 Inflation had turned out a little higher than expected in January, but this reflected movement in the highly volatile seasonal food component.  It was possible that better weather in February would lower some seasonal food prices.  This had no implications for inflation two years or so ahead.  The Committee noted that the timing of the Budget would mean that annual changes in fuel duties—from the previously announced ‘escalator’—would be included in the March RPI figure this year, rather than in April as had been the case in 1998.  This would mean a temporary rise in  Monetary Policy Committee 67 RPIX inflation in March, all other things being equal.  The Committee noted that inflation outturns had been at, or above, 21/2% since the introduction of the new policy framework in 1997.  These outturns were more surprising given the mainly dampening shocks to world demand and prices.  It would be important to consider whether there were any lessons from this. 26 The GDP deflator had risen 2.8% in the year to 1998 Q4, and was the highest for some time.  However, the increase in the annual rate partly reflected a low figure in 1997 Q4 dropping out of the comparison, as well as some terms of trade effects.  The rise in the household expenditure deflator was still below 2% in the year to Q4.   Other considerations bearing on the decision this month 27 Before turning to the immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed a number of other considerations.  First, should the Committee seek to offset the projected weak GDP growth in the first half of 1999?  Even if demand and output were turning out weaker than expected, the lags in the operation of monetary policy had previously been assumed to be such that only a limited effect on activity would be possible.  However it was possible that there were signs, for example in the confidence surveys, of a more rapid response to changes in interest rates than had been the case in the past.  One possible explanation was that the new monetary policy regime provided greater confidence in the commitment to the inflation target which was consistent with the fall in inflation expectations, and might help to explain the moderation of earnings growth since mid 1998. 28 Second, the exchange rate had risen, especially in recent days, to a level above that implied by the central projection in the February Inflation Report, despite the 50 basis point reduction in interest rates at the previous meeting.  By itself this would tend to reduce import prices and retail prices, and might justify a reduction in interest rates.  But it was too soon to judge whether the rise would persist, and what reaction there would be to a further reduction in rates.  In any case, it would not be sensible for policy to react to high frequency movements in the exchange rate, as this could lead to a volatile path for interest rates from month to month, and might make it more difficult for others to understand the motives for interest rate changes.  29 Third, the Committee considered whether there was any particular significance in changing interest rates so soon after an Inflation Report round.  Some members felt that clear news was needed for rates to change so shortly after the last forecast; otherwise, it would appear to downgrade the value and role of the projections. The immediate policy decision 30 There were four key developments over the month.  First, the revised earnings data had been published.  Second, the effective exchange rate had strengthened.  Third, if anything, the GDP figures were weaker than expected, particularly if weight were placed on the rise in inventories and/or the sharper than expected fall in exports.  Finally, there had been a uniform strengthening of survey measures, albeit from a low level.  On balance, these four factors suggested slightly lower prospective inflation than thought at the time of the February Inflation Report.  31 Some possible reasons for a further reduction in interest rates were identified.  If, for example, it was expected that the rise in sterling would be maintained, there might be a case for a 25 basis point reduction in interest rates this month.  Second, maintaining rates at their current level this month might be interpreted as a signal that a floor in rates had been reached, which might stall—or even reverse—the recovery in business and consumer sentiment.  32 One view was that the news on the month did not, as yet, amount to a sufficient case for a further reduction in interest rates. It would be better to see more evidence, in particular whether the strength in the surveys was maintained and whether it began to feed through to the official data.  There would also be a benefit in undertaking more analysis of the revised earnings data.  On this view, the repo rate should be maintained at 5.5%.  Among those members holding this view, some felt that it was now slightly more likely than a month ago that there would be a further reduction. 33 The Committee discussed whether, even though there was not a compelling case for an immediate 25 basis point reduction in rates, there might be a case for a smaller reduction.  There could be a case for moving in smaller steps than 25 basis points if the data warranted it.  However, since the Committee had not previously made changes in anything other than multiples of 25 basis points, there would be a risk of providing a confusing signal to markets. Some members also thought it would imply a degree of fine-tuning beyond what was sensible.   34 Another view was that interest rates should be close to or possibly below the ‘neutral’ level at this point in the economic cycle.  On that view, the reduction in rates of 50 basis points at the February meeting had brought the level of interest rates into its probable neutral range.  The news over the past month reinforced the view that interest rates might need to be reduced further.  But we had only started to see the effects of previous interest rate reductions, and nominal long and short-term interest rates were now close to their lowest level for many years.  The reactions of firms and households—both savers and borrowers—to such historically unusual levels were difficult to predict with much confidence.  Although the direction of interest rates was still more likely than not to be down, there was no urgency this month and it was best to observe how the economy reacted to the earlier interest rate reductions.  On this view, therefore, the repo rate should be maintained at 5.5%. 35 Another view in February had been that a reduction in rates of 75–100 basis points was required.  That view had been predicated on the assumption that first, the central projection in the Inflation Report was around 0.2 percentage points too high;  and second, that it was possible to ease with a view to supporting activity in the near term without endangering achievement of the inflation target.  This was especially true if the transmission mechanism was faster than had, on average, been the case in the past.  The news on the month suggested that both activity and inflation might be a little lower than expected, and could justify a reduction in interest rates over and above what had been thought necessary a month ago.  On this view, a reduction of 25–50 basis points was now required. 36 The Governor invited members of the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate be maintained at 5.5%. Eight members of the Committee (the Governor, Mervyn King, David Clementi, Alan Budd, Charles Goodhart, DeAnne Julius, Ian Plenderleith and John Vickers) voted for the proposition. Willem Buiter voted against, preferring a reduction of 0.4%. 37 The following members of the Committee were present: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Alan Budd Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers 38 Gus O’Donnell was present as the Treasury representative.  Inflation Report:  May 1999 68 1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by the Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee on 26 February, in advance of its meeting on 2–3 March 1999.  At the start of the Committee meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and that information is included in the Annex. I Monetary conditions 2 Growth of notes and coin had picked up in February.  After adjusting for the effects of the introduction of the new 50 pence and £2 coins, the three-month growth rate was 7.0%, compared with 6.7% in January, and the six-month growth rate was 6.2%, compared with 5.9% in January.  The one-month growth rate was 0.5%, the same as in January and a little higher than the average figure for 1998.  A small increase in these growth rates might  have been expected following interest rate cuts in the second half  of 1998, which reduced the opportunity cost of holding notes and coin. 3 The stock of M4 had fallen by £10 million in January.  The twelve-month growth rate had fallen to 7.3%, the lowest since June 1995. 4 Within M4, the balances of other financial corporations (OFCs) had fallen by £2.6 billion in January, making it less likely that December’s modest increase was a purely temporary effect associated with the end of the financial year.  The twelve-month growth rate, at 11.0%, had more than halved over the past year. 5 Following the introduction of self-assessment, January had become a more important month for payment of income tax.  It seemed unlikely that this had yet had its full effect on the estimated seasonal component, which may in turn explain why the strong flow into household sector M4 in December (+£5.5 billion) had been followed by a much weaker January (+£1.7 billion).  Looking at the average flow over these two months, the gradual pick-up in household sector M4 towards the end of last year appeared to have continued. 6 Private non financial corporations (PNFCs’) holdings of M4 had risen by £0.9 billion in January, largely reversing a £1.0 billion fall in December.  Payments of corporation tax in January had been significantly lower than in recent years.  Hence there was a risk that the process of seasonally adjusting the monetary aggregates, which looks at the past behaviour of each series, had artificially lowered PNFCs’ M4 in December 1998 and artificially boosted it in January 1999.  Averaging over these two months, the flow was close to zero. 7 Sterling lending by M4 institutions had grown by 0.5% in January, the same rate as in December.  But the three, six and twelve-month growth rates had all fallen, and remained below rates during the first half of 1998. 8 M4 lending to OFCs had fallen by £0.3 billion in January. This was smaller than the fall in their M4 deposits, so OFCs’ net recourse to banks had increased.  During the fourth quarter of 1998, lending to OFCs had been underpinned by lending to financial leasing companies.  According to less comprehensive data from the Major British Banking Group, the contribution of lending to financial leasing companies in January was again strong (up by 1.0%). 9 M4 lending to the household sector had risen by 0.6% in January.  Total lending to individuals (excluding lending to unincorporated businesses, but including lending by a number of non-M4 institutions) had also risen by 0.6%.  The twelve-month growth rate was 7.7%.  Lending secured on dwellings had risen by 0.5% in January, as in each month since August 1998.  There had been a small rise in the rate of unsecured credit growth, from 0.7% in December to 1.4% in January.  The three and six-month annualised growth rates were 14.3% and 15.6% respectively, below those during the first half of last year. 10 Turning to price indicators of monetary conditions, more than half the institutions sampled by the Bank had not passed on in full the most recent cut in official rates to their standard variable mortgage rates.  For the time being, this was probably of limited significance;  since September 1998, standard variable mortgage rates had fallen by 198 basis points, only 2 basis points less than the fall in official rates over the same period. 11 Since the February MPC meeting, there had been some rise in medium to long-term inflation expectations (as derived from a comparison of the yield on nominal and index-linked gilts).  Much of the rise, particularly at the ten-year horizon, occurred on  4 February, the day when official rates were reduced by 50 basis points.  By contrast, there had been little change in survey measures of inflation expectations for end 1999 and end 2000.  These remained at around 2.2% to 2.3%. II Demand and output 12 GDP at constant market prices had grown by 0.2% in  1998 Q4, but the annual rate had been revised down to 1.3% from 1.6%.  The expenditure breakdown had shown domestic demand growing by 1.2% in Q4, reflecting a sharp increase in investment and inventories.  Net trade had made a negative contribution to GDP growth of -1.1%.  The shortfall of the expenditure measure of GDP relative to the average measure was 0.6% of GDP in Q4. 13 Growth in household spending had increased to 0.4% from 0.1% in Q3.  Bank staff had not expected total household spending growth in Q4 to be as weak as had been suggested by retail sales volumes.  The level of spending in Q3 had been revised down by 0.1 percentage points, but there had been upward revisions in the first half of 1998. 14 Investment had grown by 2.0% in Q4.  Growth had also been revised up in Q3 to 1.8% from 1.1%.  The strength in Q4 was partly because of erratic factors.  Nevertheless, sectoral growth rates had been broadly consistent with survey evidence on investment intentions:  service sector investment growth had remained strong at 5.2%, and manufacturing investment had declined by 3.1%.  The annual growth of whole-economy investment had slowed during 1998. 15 Inventories had risen sharply by £1.9 billion in Q4, but the level had been revised down by a cumulative £215 million in the first three quarters of 1998.  Stock building in ‘other industries’ had accounted for £1.6 billion of the rise.  This category includes the quarterly alignment, which was constrained to sum to zero in the year as a whole.  Unless there had been very large revisions to the alignment adjustment—and stocks data had not supported this—it could explain only a part of the overall increase in other industries’ stocks.  ‘Other industries’ included car dealers, for whom stocks may have been boosted by the switch to twice-yearly registration periods starting in March.  Stocks in the manufacturing and retail sector had made a negative contribution to GDP growth. Manufacturers’ stocks of finished goods had risen by £113 million, less than half the increase in Q3.  But survey evidence had indicated a continued stock overhang.  The CBI monthly trends survey had recorded a small increase in the balance on excess Annex:  Summary of data presented by Bank staff  Monetary Policy Committee 69 stocks of finished goods to +24 in February from +23 in January, and the balance had remained well above its long-run average. 16 In Q4, exports had declined sharply by 2.4%, and imports had increased by 0.9%.  In 1998, there had been tentative signs that the slowdown in final demand had reduced import growth. Looking ahead, the CBI survey shows exporters increasingly less pessimistic about prospects, with the balance on optimism rising to -18 in January from -41 in October.  But the CBI export orders balance had remained negative.  Monthly trade data had shown that the decline in exports to non-EU countries had continued in January, with goods exports, excluding oil and erratic items, declining by 6.8%. 17 Manufacturing output had fallen by 1.3% in Q4.  Service sector output had increased by 0.6%, compared with 0.8% in Q3. Within the service sector, output had continued to grow strongly in the transport/communications and finance/business sectors.  Output had been unchanged in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, consistent with weak retail sales in Q4.  Construction output had declined for the third quarter in a row, by 0.2%. 18 The gross operating surplus of corporations had declined by 0.2% in Q4.  19 Retail sales volumes had risen by 1.1% in January, more than reversing the decline in December.  But the underlying trend had been unchanged, with sales volumes in the three months to January 1.5% higher than a year earlier.  Sales of clothing, footwear and household goods had grown particularly strongly, partly because of sharp price-discounting.  A survey by the Bank’s regional Agents covering 108 retailers had supported the view that spending was weak.  A majority of respondents had reported declining sales values in December and January relative to a  year earlier.  Consumer confidence was cited as a key reason.   This had implied a sharper slowdown than indicated by the official data. 20 House price inflation had slowed.  The Bank’s house price index based on Land Registry data had risen 5.9% in the year to Q4 (down from 7.9% in Q3) and the Halifax house price index had risen by 3.7% in the year to February (down from 4.4% in January). There had been preliminary signs that activity might have turned up.  The House Builders’ Federation survey in January had shown the first positive balances in seven months on visitors to sites and on net reservations compared with a year earlier.  These had been leading indicators of housing transactions in the past.  Particulars delivered had risen in February for the second month running.  But the recovery was from a low level, and transactions had been 3% lower than a year earlier.  The firming-up in housing activity had been consistent with some recovery in consumer confidence.  The GfK confidence indicator had risen to -0.6% in February from a trough of -8.2% in October. 21 Survey evidence had continued to indicate declining manufacturing output in the first two months of 1999 Q1.  The output balance of the CBI Trends survey was -10 in February compared with -13 in January.  The CIPS survey output balance had remained below 50 in February, for the eleventh month running. But there had been continued signs of an easing in the rate of decline of new orders, mainly because of a bottoming-out in export orders.  In the service sector, the CIPS business activity index had remained below 50 for the fourth successive month, indicating contracting output, although the rate of decline had eased. III International environment 22 US GDP had risen by 1.5% in the fourth quarter, according to the preliminary estimate.  Industrial production was flat in January, and had been growing at around 1.7% on a year earlier for the past three months.  Although monthly data had suggested some stabilisation in the trade balance, further falls in net exports were expected in 1999, reflecting slowing growth in the euro area and Latin America.  Retail sales growth had slowed in January but this may have simply reflected one-off factors.  Consumer confidence had risen again in February, most notably in the ‘current conditions’ index.  Industrial confidence, as measured by the National Association of Purchasing Managers Index, had also risen in February.  Manufacturing employment had continued to fall, but service sector job growth remained robust, so that overall employment growth remained above that of the labour force. Despite strong monetary growth and robust real GDP growth, annual inflation remained subdued and was unchanged in January at 1.6%. 23 In the euro area, imbalances between the consumer and producer sectors had persisted.  Euro-area GDP had risen by 2.7% on a year earlier in the third quarter.  French GDP had risen by 0.7% in the fourth quarter.  In Germany, GDP had fallen by 0.4% in the fourth quarter.  The contribution from net trade to quarterly German growth was -0.8 percentage points, the largest quarterly negative contribution since 1993 Q2.  German services output had grown by 1.0% in the fourth quarter, compared with 1.1% in the previous quarter.  The French survey of service sector output had tracked the official measure of output fairly closely in recent years, and pointed to a moderate slowdown in service sector growth in 1999 Q1.  Euro-area industrial production growth had fallen by 0.4% in the year to December, compared with 3.2% in the year to October.  Euro-area industrial confidence had stabilised in January, close to its historical average.  Euro-area consumer confidence had risen to zero in January from -1 in December;  this compared  with -9 in January 1998.  Inflation in the euro area on the harmonised measure fell to 0.8% on a year earlier in December, from 0.9% in November.  In January, the three-month moving average of the twelve-month growth rate of M3 increased to 4.9%, compared with the reference rate of 4.5% set by the European Central Bank. 24 The Bank of Japan had lowered the overnight discount rate to a range below 15 basis points on 12 February.  The Ministry of Finance had also partially reversed its position on Trust Fund Bureau purchases of Japanese government bonds (JGBs), allowing the Bureau to resume outright purchases of JGBs in the secondary market.  The yen had subsequently weakened further and 10 year bond yields had fallen back below 2%.  Retail sales had remained weak in January, falling by 4.5% on a year earlier.  Industrial production had risen by 0.8% in January, but it was still down by 7.5% over the past twelve months.  Industrial production had fallen by 6.9% in 1998 as a whole.  The inventory index was at its lowest level since February 1995.  The Japanese trade surplus had widened in January to 760 billion yen, compared with 386 billion yen in January 1998.  The growth in the surplus had reflected the weak state of Japanese private demand in 1998.  It had also reflected the fall in commodity prices which, alongside more recent strength in the yen, had lowered the value of imports.  The Consensus Economics average of forecasts for GDP growth in 1999 was unchanged at -1.1% in February.   IV The labour market 25 Employment had continued to grow strongly at the end of 1998.  According to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), employment in Q4 was 122,000 (0.4%) higher than in Q3, and 305,000 (1.1%) higher than in 1997 Q4.  The main contribution to the rise in Q4 had come from growth in the number of employees, but the number of self-employed people had also risen, reversing the recent downward trend.  A full sectoral breakdown was not yet available, but monthly data had showed that manufacturing jobs had fallen  by some 2% in the year to Q4.  The February manufacturing  survey from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) had suggested that employment in the sector had continued to fall in early 1999, though at a slightly slower rate.  The  CIPS surveys on services and construction, and the report on jobs from the Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services  Inflation Report:  May 1999 70 (FRES), had pointed to declines in employment, as they had for some time. 26 Though employment had continued to rise in 1998, hours worked had been broadly flat.  Total hours worked had fallen by 0.2% in Q4, and average hours per worker were 0.6% lower.  About half of the fall in average hours worked had reflected a rise in the number of part-time jobs.  The other half had reflected a fall in average hours worked by full-time workers, consistent with a reduction in overtime working. 27 The number of jobs advertised in national newspapers had fallen in January, according to the Press Recruitment Advertising Index.  The stock of unfilled Job-centre vacancies had also fallen, by 2,200 in January.  But new vacancy notifications had remained at a high level, rising by 9,300 in January after falls in November and December.  Overall, the Bank’s regional Agents had reported a broadly unchanged level of skills shortages.  But significant sectoral differences had persisted.  Skills shortages were declining in the financial sector, according to the most recent CBI/Price Waterhouse Coopers survey, and were flat to falling in the small business sector, according to the Small Business Research Trust. But shortages in the construction sector were reported to be back at their 1997 peaks by the Federation of Master Builders. 28 The rise in employment in Q4 had been accompanied by further falls in both inactivity and unemployment.  The LFS measure of unemployment had fallen by 15,000 in Q4, and the claimant count had fallen by 5,700 in January.  But unemployment rates had been unchanged, at 6.2% and 4.6% respectively.  There was still no evidence of the reported rise in redundancies in the inflows to the claimant count, which fell by a further 6,500 in January.  Exit rates had remained at historically high levels. Unemployment of six months or more among 18 to 24 year olds had been falling by around 6,000 a month.  Some of this probably reflected the impact of the Government’s New Deal for young people.  But, in net terms, all of the rise in employment in Q4 had been accounted for by workers aged 35 or over. 29 The Average Earnings Index had been reinstated on 2 March, following the conclusion of an independent review commissioned by the Chancellor.  The headline earnings measure had been available up to July 1998 under the suspended series.  According to the new series, headline whole-economy annual average earnings growth had fallen from 5.1% in August to 4.5% in November, reflecting a decline in the growth of both regular and irregular pay. There had also been extensive revisions to the back data, reflecting a number of changes in the method of calculation.  In contrast to the suspended series—which had been relatively volatile—the new series showed headline earnings growth rising steadily from a trough of around 21/2% in 1995 to a peak of 5.7% in May 1998. 30 Other data had also suggested a more subdued outlook for settlements and earnings in recent months.  The Reward index  of annual earnings growth had continued to fall, from a peak  of 5.4% in June 1998 to 4.6% in January.  The Bank’s  employment-weighted twelve-month mean measure of  whole-economy settlements had remained at 3.7% in January, but the private sector measure had fallen by 0.1 percentage points to 3.9%.  In a matched sample of firms from the Bank’s settlements database, 86% of employees settling in January had received  a lower settlement in 1999 than they had in 1998.  The employment-weighted mean for this sample had fallen from 3.8% in 1998 to 3.2% in 1999.  The three-month settlements measures from the CBI, Industrial Relations Services and Engineering Employers’ Federation had also all fallen in January.  And the Bank’s regional Agents reported that falling profits and subdued business optimism had led to an easing in pay pressures in manufacturing.  But it was possible that there would be some rise in whole-economy settlements in April, when the National Minimum Wage and the settlement agreed by the Public Sector Review Bodies both came into effect. V Prices 31 Commodity price deflation had continued to moderate;  in January the Bank’s (provisional) index, excluding oil, had fallen by 5.2% on a year earlier, compared with -7.4% in December.  Natural disasters and sterling’s depreciation had increased the sterling price of imported commodities in January;  the (provisional) index had risen by 1.1%.  Food price deflation had moderated following the unwinding of the downward shocks experienced since mid-1996. Annual inflation had been zero in December.  But forthcoming potential reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy looked likely to decrease prices.  The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was estimating a direct effect of up to -0.3 percentage points on the RPI in the year following implementation, assuming full  pass-through of the cuts to retail prices. 32 The one-month futures price of Brent crude oil had averaged $10.50 in February, down from $11.09 in January—the effects of a report of falling inventories and cold weather in the United States in January had been short-lived.  Manufacturers’ material input prices had risen by 0.4% in January, reflecting the rise in oil prices, but there had been no clear change in the downward trend.  Annual inflation had remained negative at -6.7%. 33 Manufacturers’ output price inflation had remained at historically low levels.  Excluding excise duties, prices had fallen for the seventh consecutive month in January, by 0.2%, leaving them 0.8% below their level a year ago.  Total output prices had been flat year on year.  The CBI industrial trends survey had pointed to further price falls. 34 Trade prices for goods had continued to decline in December.  Total import prices of goods had fallen by 6.4% in the year to December;  total export prices of goods had fallen by 3.8%. In contrast, national accounts data showed that services export prices had risen by 1.4% and import prices by 0.1% in Q4.  The annual rate of increase of the GDP deflator had risen to 2.8% in  Q4 1998, from 2.0% in Q3.  The sharp rise was partly explained  by the volatile path of quarterly inflation in 1997, and by increased contributions from government, trade and inventories prices.   The household expenditure deflator, at 1.9%, had remained below RPIX inflation.  That rise had led to a 0.8 percentage point rise in the GDP deflator based measure of domestically generated inflation, to 3.2%.  The RPI-based measure had remained unchanged at 4.9%. 35 RPIX inflation had remained at 2.6% in January.  RPIY inflation had been 2.0%.  RPIX services inflation had fallen by  0.1 percentage points to 3.4%, and RPIX goods inflation had remained at 1.4%.  Total food price inflation had risen above RPIX inflation.   36 HICP inflation had increased by 0.1 percentage points in January for the third consecutive month, to 1.6%.  The difference between HICP and RPIX inflation had fallen by 0.1 percentage points to 1.0 percentage points, of which  0.5 percentage points was due to the method of calculation and 0.4 percentage points to the exclusion of various owner-occupied housing costs. VI Agents’ national summary 37 The Bank’s regional Agents reported on their assessment of the economy drawn from their discussions with contacts over the past month.  Overall, the recent decline in manufacturing activity appeared to have eased significantly, and destocking was well under way.  Nonetheless, performance had remained dependent on sector.  For example, railway and aerospace demand had been strong, while textiles, ceramics and electrical components manufacturers had continued to suffer from intense import competition.  There had been few reports of any increases in output. One exception had been exports to Europe, where some contacts had won back orders as sterling had depreciated.  But demand from  Monetary Policy Committee 71 France and Germany had begun to decline by the end of the period. Construction sector activity had remained buoyant, but enquiries and orders had begun to decline.  Demand for commercial developments had been weaker in the north of the United Kingdom than in the south east.  Housing market activity had increased since January, especially at the higher-quality end of the market. Increased investment in city-centre property had been reported. Growth in output of business services had declined, reflecting weak manufacturing activity.  For example, hauliers had reported falling demand, and corporate travel suppliers had noted trading-down to less expensive travel options.  But demand for financial services and telecommunications had remained strong.  Retail sales growth had been weak in February;  as yet, retailers had reported little increase in consumer demand following the recent interest cuts. Consumer demand for leisure services, such as gymnasiums, overseas holidays and restaurants had remained strong. 38 In the manufacturing sector, employment had fallen and the decline was expected to continue.  That had increased concern about employment prospects, and had reduced wage demands. Declining activity had lowered overtime and bonus payments. Growth in service sector pay settlements had remained above manufacturing but had continued to fall, reflecting a decline in activity.  Skill shortages had persisted (heavy goods vehicle drivers, precision engineers, accountants and lawyers, for example), but not worsened.  Raw materials, intermediate and finished goods prices had continued to fall.  Retailers had continued to cut prices in order to reduce high stock levels.  Investment intentions had declined across the board.  Manufacturers had continued to invest to improve productivity, rather than to expand capacity.  And an increasing number of service sector contacts had postponed expansion plans. VII Information from financial markets Foreign exchange 39 The US dollar had continued to strengthen since the previous meeting, and now stood about 7% higher against both the yen and the euro compared with the beginning of the year.  The yen had weakened following a cut in interest rates, and there had been statements by the Japanese authorities indicating that they were more comfortable with a weaker yen.  The euro had weakened following the release of weaker-than-expected economic data for the euro area. 40 Sterling had appreciated in effective terms, although it was now at an 18-month low against the stronger dollar.  Sterling’s implied volatility had risen since the previous MPC meeting, but was still lower than at the beginning of the year.  Options data suggested that the probability of a large sterling fall against the euro had declined. Government bond and money markets 41 Expectations for UK interest rates in 1999 had fallen, but had risen looking two years or more forward.  The market’s reaction to the minutes of the previous MPC meeting had been a major reason for this.  Three-month Libor rates were now expected to rise after falling to a level of 5%.  In the United States, rates expected for next year and beyond had risen by around 50 basis points, primarily because of Fed Chairman Greenspan’s  Humphrey-Hawkins testimony.  Near-term euribor rates had remained broadly unchanged.  The gilt yield curve had flattened, with yields rising most for maturities between five and ten years. In general, bond prices abroad had also weakened since the previous meeting, with the exception of Japan. Equity and corporate debt markets 42 The UK stock market had risen, and the FT-SE 100 index  had touched an all-time high.  In contrast, the US market had  fallen since the previous MPC meeting, driven by the  Humphrey-Hawkins testimony.  The other main international indices had remained broadly unchanged. 43 In the United States, credit spreads for the most highly rated firms had fallen by 8 basis points, but spreads for lower-credit firms had risen by 5 basis points.  In the United Kingdom, credit spreads for highly rated firms had fallen by about 15 basis points, and by more than 30 basis points for lower-credit firms.  Swap spreads in the United States had risen slightly, but had fallen at all maturities in the United Kingdom. 44 Analysts’ and fund managers’ forecasts of corporate earnings in 2000 had been revised up slightly since the previous MPC meeting.  Profit warnings had declined in February compared with the previous three months, and for the first time in several months the level was below that recorded a year ago.  Compared with February 1998, there had been a sharp decline in the proportion of firms citing the strength of sterling or problems in emerging markets as the reason for their worsened performance.  Inflation Report:  May 1999 72 The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee today voted to maintain the Bank’s repo rate at 5.5%. The minutes of the meeting will be published at 9.30 am on Wednesday 17 March. Text of Bank of England press notice of 3 March 1999 Bank of England maintains interest rates at 5.5%  Monetary Policy Committee 73 Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 7–8 April 1999 1 The Committee discussed the prospects for the world economy;  the exchange rate, money and credit;  demand and output (including business confidence indicators);  the housing market;  the labour market;  prices;  and other issues including tactics, before turning to its immediate policy decision. The world economy 2 The Committee discussed whether the prospects for the world economy had improved over the past month.  In the United States, domestic demand in particular had continued to grow strongly, with little sign yet of any slowdown in growth or any pick-up in inflation.  Supply side developments in the United States appeared to be more favourable than in the euro area, although in several European countries output remained below potential. Growth was sluggish and industrial sentiment weak, particularly in Germany.  Meanwhile expectations had grown of a reduction in interest rates by the European Central Bank (ECB).  In Japan, the Nikkei had recovered strongly in the last few weeks of the financial year, with buying from foreign investors amid signs of a higher probability of corporate restructuring.  But any recovery in business sentiment had been muted—and might be reversed—while consumer confidence could be further damaged by record levels of unemployment. 3 Outside the major industrial countries, spreads on emerging market sovereign dollar debt—as measured by J P Morgan—had fallen by over 200 basis points during the month.  Sentiment—and in some cases activity—was a little stronger in East Asia and Latin America, where some countries had benefited from higher oil prices.  The markets appeared to have discounted a deterioration in prospects in Russia.  So in general, developments in the world economy seemed much as expected in the February Inflation Report, although the downside risks to activity might have diminished somewhat.  A major uncertainty was over the events in Kosovo, where the effects on consumer and business confidence elsewhere, and on the budgetary positions of the NATO countries, were not yet clear. 4 There were some signs that commodity prices had begun to bottom out, and oil prices had risen sharply as a result of agreed cutbacks in supply.  While it was too soon to judge whether these increases would persist, the cutbacks appeared to have greater credibility in the market than had sometimes been the case.  The downward pressure on world prices from oil and other commodities might therefore be less than in the recent past.  But with most economies outside the United States below productive capacity, the scope for a generalised pick-up in inflation was limited. The exchange rate, money and credit 5 For most of the month sterling had been stronger than at the time of the previous meeting of the Committee, particularly against the euro, although it had weakened a little in recent days.  But the effective exchange rate index remained over 2% higher than implied by the central projection in the February Inflation Report. Many possible explanations had been advanced for sterling’s strength, and discussed by the Committee in this as in previous meetings.  If this strength in the exchange rate were sustained, it would tend to dampen inflation, and also activity in the internationally traded sectors of the economy. 6 So far as money was concerned, growth rates for M4 had continued to slow, as expected, with a sharp decrease in the contribution from other financial corporations (OFCs).  Growth in M4 lending had also slowed further. Demand and output 7 The Committee discussed the revisions made to the estimates of the level and composition of GDP for 1997 and 1998.  Since the February Inflation Report, the estimated level of GDP at market prices in 1998 Q4 had been reduced by 1/2%, although by only 1/4% when measured at basic prices.  This had consequences for measures of the output gap and labour productivity.  The implications for future price developments were unclear.  On one interpretation, this implied that there was less pressure on capacity and that, given the lags involved, the effects of slower GDP growth had yet to feed through fully into lower inflation.  On an alternative view, it suggested a less favourable short-run trade-off between activity and inflation;  inflation was unchanged and either capacity utilisation was lower, core inflation higher or estimates of capacity had been reduced.  But the size of the changes had not been large, and it was not clear on either view how much significance should be attached to this. 8 Estimates for the growth of GDP in 1998 Q4 had also been revised downwards, to 0.1% over the previous quarter.  Within this total, the weakest demand components had been government consumption and net trade.  In contrast private consumption and investment had been revised up, significantly so in the case of business investment.  At the same time, the downwards revision to inventories suggested that the risks of a significant stock cycle in 1999 had diminished, particularly since stocks held by manufacturers and retailers appeared under control.  This interpretation was in line with earlier survey evidence for these sectors.  But because of the downwards revision to the level of GDP, the estimated stock-output ratio was little changed. 9 Retail sales volumes had declined in February, and on a three month average had been only 1% above the levels of a year earlier. But the CBI distributive trades survey suggested that a trough might have been reached, and spending on services, which was not included in retail sales, had continued to grow faster than spending on goods.  The GfK consumer confidence index was now positive for the first time in nine months.  When taken together with other information on consumer spending, the data appeared in line with the Inflation Report projections for consumption in the first quarter of 1999. 10 The Committee considered the prospects for investment. The financial deficit of the private non-financial corporations (PNFCs) had widened to 3% of GDP, the highest level since 1990. This might in part reflect the growth of business investment in the second half of 1998.  The increase appeared to have been most marked in the services sector, and might represent a bringing forward of IT-related spending ahead of the millennium.  The millennium might also boost spending on construction this year, with signs, perhaps, that next year would be less buoyant.  All  this might have implications for the profile of activity over the next two years.  But work by Bank staff suggested that movements in the credit and money holdings of the PNFCs were consistent both with the recent strength of investment, and continued growth in 1999. 11 The Committee agreed that the Budget contained little that altered the outlook for inflation.  At its previous meeting it had decided that the figures for the overall fiscal position, on which the Committee had been briefed, were in line with the assumptions made in the February Inflation Report.  Following the Budget itself, an analysis of the implications of the detailed measures for the composition of demand suggested that these should not have a significant additional effect on the prospects for activity and inflation over the forecast period.  Inflation Report:  May 1999 74 12 Forward-looking survey evidence continued to suggest an improvement (from a low base) in business confidence in all sectors of the economy.  But official data and that from surveys indicated that manufacturing output was still declining, and information from the Bank’s regional Agents suggested that in this sector in particular, confidence remained fragile.  By contrast, the CIPS index for services output had risen above 50, indicating growth rather than contraction, for the first time since October.  The  sharp fall seen in the second half of 1998 might have been partly  in response to events in financial markets at that time.  A recovery in confidence had therefore been expected, with the readings  now consistent with the central projection for output in 1999 contained in the February Inflation Report.  The CIPS survey for construction had also strengthened, in line with other indicators for that sector. 13 All in all, the data suggested that the prospects for activity were little different from those expected at the time of the February Inflation Report.  The downwards revision to the level of GDP had been interpreted by some commentators as reducing inflationary pressures, but the size of the revision of GDP measured at basic prices was small, and the implications for inflation ambiguous.  At the same time, significant changes had been made to the composition of demand, particularly to investment and stockbuilding.  While the recovery in business confidence had yet to be reflected in official figures, this was to be expected given the lags involved. The housing market 14 There had been a sharp increase in the Halifax and Nationwide house price indices in March.  Data from the House Builders Federation on net reservations and site visits, together with figures on loan approvals and particulars delivered, suggested that turnover in the housing market had risen.  The increase had followed a sharp fall towards the end of 1998, and the turnaround might have been influenced by the fall in interest rates since October. The labour market 15 Employment had continued to rise, with the LFS measure increasing by 119,000 in the last three months.  However, much of this increase had been in part-time employment, and on a full time equivalent basis the increase had probably been closer to 50,000. Total hours worked had fallen, and the unemployment rate had risen.  The effects of this on consumer confidence may not yet have been seen.  The surveys were mixed;  while some suggested a sharp downturn in the demand for labour, with the Manpower survey showing the weakest job prospects since 1993, the CIPS employment index had risen slightly, but remained below 50. 16 The latest data for average earnings growth continued the fall seen since the new series was released.  The headline figure had reached 4.3% in December.  This decline was linked to a reduction in hours worked per head, and to a negative contribution from bonuses. 17 Data on settlements also indicated a decline in nominal wage pressures, although inflation expectations appeared to have fallen by even more.  The decline in settlements was not yet apparent from the headline twelve month figures, but for a matched sample of firms from the Bank’s database, settlements this year were running at 3.3% in January and February, as against 4% the previous year. Prices 18 The implications of a reduction in earnings growth for inflation would depend on a variety of factors, including developments in productivity, margins and import prices. Productivity growth over the past three years had been below its  40 year average.  It was difficult to know how much weight to attach to observed productivity growth over such a short period. But relatively small differences in assumptions about productivity could have a material effect on the projections for inflation over the next two years.  More generally, the pass-through from unit labour costs to prices was not straightforward.  It would depend, among other things, on cyclical conditions and on other input prices. These issues would be looked at again in the forthcoming Inflation Report round. 19 Oil prices were much higher than a month ago, although some rise had already been assumed in the central projection in the February Inflation Report. These increases would exert some upwards pressure on input prices, particularly since the falls in  non-oil commodity prices might be coming to an end.  Depending on the path of the exchange rate, domestic inflationary pressures might come more to the fore in determining the path of RPIX, even if competition from imports remained intense.  On the other hand, the recent falls in non-oil commodity prices had been steeper than expected, and the exchange rate had strengthened.  The balance between domestic and international inflationary pressures would be examined in the context of the next Inflation Report. 20 The most recent figure for RPIX inflation—at 2.4%—had been below the target for the first time since the Committee had been established.  This had been despite some strength in the price of seasonal foods, which might unwind in coming months.  But the difference from the 2.5% target was very small, and of little relevance to the prospects for inflation two years ahead.  Next month it was very likely that RPIX inflation would be above target as a result of the timing of Budget measures, which would affect petrol prices in March as compared with April last year.  But this effect would last for only a month, and should have no implications for inflation in two years’ time. Tactical considerations 21 The Committee noted that a reduction in rates was widely expected this month, although rather less universally than had been the case a week earlier.  There was also a growing feeling in the market that the ECB might reduce its rates later that day.  Should either factor influence the Committee’s thinking? 22 It was possible that a decision to leave interest rates unchanged would be interpreted as a signal that current levels would be the trough of this interest rate cycle.  It was also possible that a similar conclusion might be reached from an unexpectedly large reduction in rates.  Given that any decision was open to misinterpretation, the Committee agreed that this was not a factor which it would take into account. 23 There was also the issue of the exchange rate.  While this was little changed from its level at the time of the previous meeting, its strength against the euro continued to surprise many observers. But the reaction of sterling to any change in UK interest rates was unclear. The immediate policy decision 24 Over the past month, there had been further revisions to the level and composition of GDP, a continuing recovery in survey data from the low points reached in the latter part of 1998, and some easing in labour market pressures, including lower settlements and earnings growth.  This was against the backdrop of a world economy in which some of the downside risks had diminished, oil prices had risen sharply, and the exchange rate was over 2% higher than assumed in the February Inflation Report. 25 Given this background the Committee discussed the case for no change to rates, a reduction of 25 basis points, and a reduction of 50 basis points.  Monetary Policy Committee 75 26 The Committee considered various developments which could have suggested leaving rates unchanged this month.  The prospects for activity were much as expected, with some signs that past reductions in interest rates were beginning to sustain activity. The changes to the composition of demand were at least as important as the downwards revision to GDP, and suggested that the downside risks to output from a stock cycle or weak investment during 1999 were less now than previously thought.  Financial wealth had risen, with share prices up further during the month and the housing market showing signs of recovery.  Survey measures of confidence had also recovered somewhat.  Overall, the evidence appeared consistent with positive, if slow, growth in GDP during the rest of this year, as set out in the central projection of the February Inflation Report.  And while there were signs that labour market pressures had begun to ease, the evidence was not conclusive (for example on earnings per hour) and the link between this and prices required further analysis.  Finally, oil prices were sharply higher. 27 But other developments pointed to the need for a further reduction in interest rates.  The effective exchange rate had been stronger throughout most of the previous month.  Earnings growth seemed to be lower than expected, a view supported by information on settlements, although assessing the implications of this for prices required more work.  Finally, confidence, although improved, probably remained fragile.  With a reduction in interest rates widely expected a decision to maintain rates at their current levels could be seen as a policy tightening, which might have an unnecessarily damaging effect on confidence and activity. 28 The previous month several members had felt that not much additional news would be required to justify a further reduction in rates.  They took the view that the balance of evidence since then supported a reduction in interest rates this month.  While the prospects for activity were little changed over the month, the risks to the inflation outlook had shifted somewhat to the downside.  It was therefore appropriate to reduce rates by 25 basis points in order to meet the inflation target. 29 Another view which favoured an immediate reduction in the repo rate of 25 basis points was that there was a growing risk that the inflation target would be undershot, given the lags between output and inflation, the intensity of price competition from overseas and the deceleration seen in settlements and earnings. Short-term inflation expectations as measured by surveys had declined, and might fall further given the sharp decline in the RPI measure of inflation.  The size of the PNFC deficit was a concern, and the growth in investment might well be a temporary  pre-millennium effect.  Finally, the intensifying Balkans conflict increased the downside risks of a further blow to confidence in the global economy.  It was therefore necessary to keep interest rates on a downwards path, and a reduction in rates of 25 basis points this month was appropriate. 30 Another view was that in March, a reduction of 40 basis points had been required.  Since then the revisions to GDP had contained little news, although given the underspend in 1998, it was possible that government final demand might increase by less than planned.  With price developments favourable, and the future earnings profile likely to be below that contained in the February Inflation Report, it was preferable to reduce the repo rate by 50 basis points now, in order to prevent inflation falling below the target and to underpin activity. 31 The Governor invited members of the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate be reduced by 25 basis points to 5.25%.  Eight members of the Committee (the Governor, Mervyn King, David Clementi, Alan Budd, Charles Goodhart, DeAnne Julius, Ian Plenderleith and John Vickers) voted for the proposition.  Willem Buiter voted against, preferring a reduction of 50 basis points. 32 The following members of the Committee were present. Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Alan Budd Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers 33 Andrew Turnbull was present as the Treasury representative.  Inflation Report:  May 1999 76 1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by the Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee on 1 April, in advance of its meeting on 7–8 April 1999.  At the start of the Committee meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and that information is included in the Annex. I The international economy 2 In the United States the final estimate of GDP in 1998 Q4 had been 1.5%, in line with the preliminary estimate.  Some special factors which may have supported robust growth in Q4, such as the seasonality of trade data, had possibly begun to unwind in Q1.  The trade deficit had widened to $17.0 billion in January from $14.1 billion in December.  However, other factors supporting rapid growth in Q4 had persisted in early 1999.  The outlook for consumption had been little changed:  retail sales growth had remained rapid in the first two months of the year and consumer confidence had risen again in March.  The NAPM index of industrial sentiment had risen further in March.  The sharpness of the rise in the NAPM index in recent months had suggested at least that the slowdown in industrial production growth might have bottomed out.  Employment growth had been strong in February, but had weakened in March.  This month-to-month volatility may have reflected some weather-related erratic influences.  The unemployment rate had fallen to 4.2% in March.  Annual growth in average hourly earnings had continued to ease, falling to 3.6% in March, and consumer price inflation had remained muted.  Since the March MPC meeting, market expectations of interest rates in the United States had declined, while equity prices in mid-1999 were expected by the market to be slightly higher. 3 Within the euro area, Italian GDP had declined by 0.3% in 1998 Q4.  This decline had been exaggerated by the smaller number of working days in the quarter compared with Q3, though the data had still revealed unexpected weakness in domestic demand growth.  In the euro area as a whole, industrial sentiment had weakened slightly in February.  The western German Ifo index had fallen in February to its lowest level since August 1996.  Yet consumer confidence had remained buoyant.  French retail sales had fallen in February but underlying growth had remained robust. The three-month centred moving average of annual broad money growth in the euro area had risen to 5.1% in January from 4.9% in December.  Monthly data showed that year on year growth had slowed to 5.2% in February from 5.6% in January, partly reflecting weaker growth of overnight deposits.  Annual growth in the  euro-area HICP had remained at 0.8% in February, and there had been little sign of inflationary pressure from intermediate prices. Since the previous MPC meeting, the euro had depreciated against the dollar and market expectations of short-term interest rates had declined.  In its spring forecast, the European Commission had revised down its projections for GDP growth in the euro area in 1999 and 2000, to 2.2% and 2.7% respectively. 4 Japanese GDP had fallen by 0.8% in 1998 Q4.  There had been evidence of earlier fiscal stimulus in the data on government investment, which had contributed 0.9 percentage points to growth in that quarter.  But all other major components of GDP had remained weak in Q4.  In February, the unemployment rate had risen to a record high of 4.6% and inactivity had increased. Employment had continued to fall.  In February, personal incomes had continued to decline.  Real consumption had fallen by 3.8% in the year to February.  The March Tankan survey of industrial sentiment had recorded a slight improvement in business confidence, owing primarily to an easing of financial conditions. But other indicators within the Tankan had remained weak.  Since the March MPC meeting, ten-year government bond yields had continued to fall, by around 25 basis points.  Market expectations of Japanese short-term interest rates had remained relatively stable, as had the yen. 5 Spreads on government bonds in emerging markets over  US Treasuries had narrowed over the month, although they remained higher in Latin America than in Asian countries. Agreement on a new IMF financial package for Brazil had been reflected in the appreciation of the Brazilian real since the previous MPC meeting.  But available data for the first two months of this year had shown that capital flows to emerging markets were unlikely to be markedly larger in Q1 than in Q4.  II Monetary and financial conditions 6 Growth of notes and coin had remained stable in March. After adjusting for the effects of the new 50 pence and £2 coins, the one-month growth rate had remained at 0.5%, as in January and February.  The annualised three-month growth rate had fallen to 6.0% in March from 6.9% in February. 7 The stock of M4 had increased by £4.2 billion in February compared with £1.2 billion in January.  The February figure included a £3.9 billion rise in repos (not seasonally adjusted).  The slowdown in annual M4 growth had continued in February:  the twelve-month growth rate of M4 had fallen to 7.4%, from 7.7% in January. 8 The growth of M4 lending had been relatively weak in February at £3.6 billion, despite strong reverse repo activity, partly reflecting a substantial securitisation.  The twelve-month growth rate of M4 lending had been 6.9% in February compared with 7.8% in January (after adjustment for the securitisation, the twelve-month growth rate was 7.1%).  This slowdown had partly reflected strong February 1998 figures dropping out of the calculation.  9 Private non-financial corporations’ (PNFCs’) holdings of M4 had grown by 1.6% in February.  The strong flow had been distorted by the proceeds of a large corporate debt issue being held on deposit.  Excluding the estimated effects of this issue, the twelve-month growth rate had risen to 6.2% in February from 5.8% in January.  When adjusted in the same way, the three and  six-month growth rates in February had fallen below their rates in January.  M4 lending to PNFCs had fallen by £0.2 billion in February.  Analysis by Bank staff had suggested that the coincident pick-up in the growth of PNFCs’ M4 lending and slowdown in M4 deposits over the previous six months might have been due to the strength of business investment in 1998 H2.  The same analysis had indicated that the current level of PNFCs’ M4 deposits and lending might suggest that business investment would remain relatively robust this year. 10 Households’ holdings of M4 had increased by £2.0 billion in February, compared with an increase of £1.9 billion in January. The weak figure for January had been attributed, in part, to the effects of concentrated income tax payments following the introduction of self-assessment.  While it was possible that these effects had also been present in the February data, the new information might imply a more general slowdown.  Households’ M4 borrowing had remained steady at £3.2 billion in February. Total lending to individuals had increased by 0.6% in February, much the same as the average since February 1998.  Within individuals’ lending, secured lending had increased by 0.5% in February.  Again this was broadly in line with one-month  changes since February 1998.  But the one-month growth rate  Annex:  Summary of data presented by Bank staff  Monetary Policy Committee 77 of unsecured lending had fallen from 1.3% in January to 0.9% in February. 11 The stock of M4 held by other financial corporations (OFCs) had increased by £0.3 billion in February compared with a fall of £1.8 billion in January.  The twelve-month growth rate in OFCs’ M4 had fallen to its lowest level since 1995 Q1.  M4 lending to OFCs had increased to £1.7 billion in February from £0.3 billion in January. 12 Turning to price indicators of monetary conditions, sterling interest rate expectations had fallen since the March MPC decision. Short-term interest rates had implied that financial market participants expected the repo rate to fall to around 5% during 1999.  Longer-term nominal interest rates had also fallen:   three-year forward rates had fallen by around 20 basis points since the March MPC meeting.  The falls had been concentrated at the short end of the yield curve. 13 Measures of short-term inflation expectations from monthly surveys had remained broadly unchanged at 2.2% to 2.3%. Measures of two-year inflation expectations from quarterly surveys had shown falls for almost all groups surveyed:  for example, the Barclays Basix survey had reported that trade unions’ average RPI inflation expectations for the next two years had fallen by 40 basis points since the 1998 Q4 survey.  Inflation forward rates, derived from index-linked bond yields, had shown little change since the March MPC meeting.  Since the February Inflation Report, however, inflation forward rates at all maturities had risen from a range of 2.5% to 2.9% to around 3%.  One explanation offered by Bank staff was that nominal yields may have been artificially depressed earlier this year as a result of institutional investors’ demand to hold liquid instruments. 14 The FT-SE 100 index had risen by 6.8% since the March MPC meeting.  Implied volatility had fallen further, and to below the levels seen before the Russian debt crisis.  The FT-SE SmallCap index had risen more than the rest of the market, reflecting in part the strength of the General industrials sector over the period.  The Resources sector had also performed very strongly alongside the rise in oil prices. 15 The effective exchange rate had fallen in recent days, after an earlier appreciation, to stand 0.3% lower than at the March MPC meeting.  Sterling had changed little against the euro and had depreciated slightly against the US dollar.  III The Budget 16 Staff presented a short summary of the Chancellor’s recent Budget.  HM Treasury’s forecast of PSNB (including the windfall tax) for 1998/99 had been revised up slightly.  Lower receipts had more than off-set lower spending.  The Budget had announced measures that would increase borrowing by £1 billion in 1999/00, £1.4 billion in 2000/01 and £3.6 billion in 2001/02.  However,  other changes to HM Treasury’s forecasts for spending and receipts over these years had led to lower projected borrowing over the same period.  Lower forecasts for social security payments and  debt interest payments had more than offset lower projected receipts. 17 Overall, the outlook for the fiscal stance was little changed since the Pre-Budget Report:  a small deficit had still been projected in 1999/00 and 2000/01 but this was cyclical in nature; the structural deficit had been projected to be broadly balanced. The ‘Golden Rule’ was expected to be met with a small margin of safety over the next three years.  The net debt to GDP ratio had been projected to fall well below 40% by 2001/02. 18 The Budget measures had been aimed at targeting help on families with children, improving work incentives and promoting enterprise through microeconomic reform.  These had included reductions in personal income tax rates;  changes to National Insurance contributions;  measures to reduce taxation for  small businesses;  and the introduction of a Children’s Tax  Credit along with increases in existing benefits to families with children. IV Demand and output 19 The 1998 Q4 National Accounts release had included revisions back to 1997 Q1.  The level of GDP at constant market prices in 1998 Q4 had been 0.3 percentage points lower than the February estimate, and 0.5 percentage points lower than the preliminary estimate.  Revisions to GDP at constant basic prices had been more limited.  Downward revisions to the level of the income and output based measures of GDP had reduced the shortfall of expenditure relative to the average measure.  In 1998 as a whole, GDP had grown by 2.1% (revised from 2.3%) compared with 3.5% (unrevised) in 1997.  The quarterly growth rate of GDP at constant market prices in Q4 had been revised down to 0.1% from 0.2%.  Within the expenditure measure of GDP, upward revisions to consumption and investment growth and the contribution of net trade had been matched by a large downward revision to changes in inventories. 20 Household spending growth in Q4 had been revised up to 0.6% from 0.4%, following an outturn of 0.1% in Q3.  Spending on vehicles and energy had been particularly volatile in Q3 and Q4. Household spending growth had slowed overall in 1998:  the annualised rate of growth had eased to 1.2% in 1998 H2 from 3.0% in H1.  Despite strong consumption growth, the household saving ratio in Q4 had risen to 7.4% from 6.3%.  This had reflected a sharp decline in tax payments which had led to an increase of 1.8% in post-tax income.  Compensation of employees had risen by 1.5% in nominal terms in Q4.  The erratic path of tax payments and household income during 1998 had partly been related to the introduction of self-assessment.  The level of tax payments made by households had risen sharply in 1998 by 17%, leading to virtually no growth in real post-tax household income. 21 Whole economy investment growth in Q4 had been revised upwards to 2.9% from 2.0%.  Business investment had grown by 5.5%.  The ratio of business investment to GDP had increased sharply in recent years—in line with the ratio in the US—to exceed its previous peak in 1989 Q3.  But the increase in the capital stock to output ratio had been more moderate.  In both the UK and the US part of the recent strength in business investment was due to IT spending. 22 Changes in inventories in Q4 had been revised downwards to £0.9 billion from £1.9 billion.  If alignment adjustments are excluded, stockbuilding had increased by less in Q4 than in Q3. The revisions had been concentrated in ‘other industries’ and manufacturing.  Manufacturers and retailers had destocked in Q4, consistent with earlier survey evidence.  But lower stockbuilding had been to some extent offset by a downward revision to output so that the stock-output ratio had been little changed.  The March CBI monthly Industrial Trends survey had continued to indicate that stocks were more than adequate:  the balance had been +20, above its average of +13 since 1985. 23 The contribution of net trade to GDP growth in Q4 had been revised to -0.9 percentage points from -1.1 as a result of upward revisions to exports and imports.  The level of exports and, to a larger extent, imports back to 1997 Q1 had also been revised upwards.  The revisions to imports had helped to reduce the puzzle about their relative weakness following sterling’s appreciation. Monthly trade data for January had shown a sharp decline in exports to EU and non-EU countries (of 3.3% and 6.7%) and a continued rise in imports.  Though the decline in exports to non-EU countries had unwound in February, overall these data had suggested another negative net trade contribution to GDP growth in 1999 Q1.  Inflation Report:  May 1999 78 24 Service sector output growth in Q4 had been revised down to 0.5% from 0.6%.  Manufacturing output had declined by an unrevised 1.3% in Q4.  Construction output growth had been revised up to 0.1%.  On the income side of the accounts, the main news had been the decline in financial company profits in Q4. 25 Retail sales volumes had declined by 0.3% in February, following January’s strong rise.  Though the three month annual growth rate declined further to 1.0%, the CBI Distributive Trades survey had suggested that the decline in sales volumes growth might have reached a trough.  The balance on reported sales in March had risen to +14—the highest since September 1998—and the orders balance had risen for the second month running.   New car registrations had fallen sharply in January and February relative to a year ago, but had been difficult to interpret because of changing seasonal patterns following the change in registration practices. 26 Industrial production had declined by 0.5% in January— because of a sharp fall in output in the energy extraction and supply industries—but had risen by 0.1% in February because of a rise in energy-related output.  Manufacturing output had shown a small increase of 0.1% in January, following five successive monthly declines, but had fallen by 0.1% in February.  Growth in industrial production over the three months to February compared with the previous three months had been -1.0% (-0.9% in January);  and for manufacturing output it had been -0.8% (-1.0% in January).  The CBI and CIPS surveys had indicated another decline in manufacturing output in 1999 Q1, though it appeared that this would be less than in 1998 Q4. 27 The CIPS Report on Services had reported a rise in all indices in March:  the output index had risen from 49.5 to 53, the first positive reading since October 1998;  the incoming new business index had also risen above 50 to 53.9, the highest level since June 1998 and above the average for 1998 as whole;  and the business expectations index had risen to 76.4 from 72.1 in February. 28 The Nationwide house price index had increased by 1.5% in March—the largest monthly rise since June 1997—and had been 7.6% higher than a year earlier;  the Halifax index had increased by 1.2% in March and had been 4.5% higher than a year earlier.  The RICS survey had suggested price rises across all regions in February.  The HBF survey balances on site visitors and net reservations had continued to indicate an increase in housing transactions in coming months.  Particulars delivered had increased for a third consecutive month, to stand 4.5% higher in the three months to February compared with the previous three months.  The GfK consumer confidence indicator had risen for the third month running. V Labour market 29 LFS employment had grown by 119,000 (0.4%) in the three months to January, compared with the previous three months, somewhat stronger than the Workforce Jobs figure of 69,000 in the three months to December.  The difference between the two measures, probably due to timing and the coverage of the surveys, was accounted for by the larger rise in employees in the LFS, driven by a large increase in part-time jobs.  Total hours worked had fallen by 0.2% in the three months to January, and average hours per worker had been 0.7% lower.  The fall in average hours worked had reflected the large rise in part-time employment and a 0.7% fall in average hours worked by full-time workers, consistent with a reduction in overtime working.  30 The strong increases in employment had contrasted with survey evidence.  The CIPS surveys for March had suggested that employment was continuing to fall in the manufacturing and construction sectors, though there had been a small increase in employment in the service sector.  Forward-looking surveys had suggested that this pattern might persist.  The Manpower survey for Q1 had shown the weakest job prospects since 1993, for the second quarter in succession.  The outlook in manufacturing had worsened, while employment intentions in the service sector had been little changed.  31 The stock of unfilled job-centre vacancies had edged down by 3,500 in February and the number of jobs advertised in national newspapers had fallen, according to the Press Recruitment Advertising Index.  But the number of permanent placements by job agencies had increased in March for the first time in six months, according to the FRES survey on the demand for staff. 32 LFS unemployment had risen by 37,000 in the three months to January, taking the rate to 6.3%.  This had been the first rise in the rate, in non-overlapping periods, since early 1993.  The number of people unemployed for more than one year had fallen by 17,000 in the three months to January, offset by a rise in short-term unemployment.  Claimant unemployment had risen by 4,300, but the rate had remained unchanged at 4.6%.  Inflows into unemployment had been broadly flat, and the exit rate from unemployment had fallen, but remained at a high level.  The rise in employment had been associated with a fall in inactivity of 117,000.  In net terms, all of the rise in employment had been concentrated among workers more than 25 years old, which had been roughly matched by falls in inactivity. 33 Headline whole-economy annual average earnings growth had fallen to 4.3% in December, reflecting a decline in the growth of irregular pay.  The slowdown in headline earnings growth since the peak in May had been sharp, but this measure referred to growth in earnings per head.  It was likely that the growth in earnings per hour had fallen less rapidly, reflecting the reduction in average hours worked over this period.  The Reward index of annual earnings growth had continued to fall, from a peak of 5.4% in June 1998 to 4.5% in February.  The growth of wages and salaries had been broadly flat since mid-1997.  The rise in 1998 Q4, which had contrasted with the fall in growth measured by the Average Earnings Index over the same period, could be explained by volatility in pension contributions and balancing adjustments between different measures of GDP.  34 The Bank’s employment-weighted twelve-month measure of whole economy settlements had remained at 3.7% in February, but the three-month measure had fallen by 0.3 percentage points to 3.3%.  In a matched sample of firms from the Bank’s settlements database, mean settlements in January and February had fallen to 3.3% in 1999, from 4% in 1998.  The proportion of employees in this sample who had received a lower settlement in 1999 had been 78%.  The three-month measure from Industrial Relations Services had also fallen in February. 35 Annual productivity growth had fallen from 1.1% in Q3  to 0.7% in Q4, the lowest rate since 1991.  The revisions to Workforce Jobs, announced in December, had caused a generally downward revision to productivity growth.  Because the growth of wages and salaries per head had increased and productivity growth had fallen in Q4, the growth of unit wage costs had continued to rise. 36 The Bank’s regional Agents had conducted a survey of their contacts about employment prospects and the adequacy and quality of their labour force.  They had asked whether contacts had expected employment to change over the next 6 months:  36% of respondents had reported that the level of employment was expected to be unchanged, whereas the number of companies who had been planning to increase staff had been the same as the number planning to shed labour (32% each).  Over 50% of manufacturers had reported that employment levels were expected to be lower whereas in the service sector over 40% of respondents expected higher employment.  There had also been some differences across regions, but most had presented a picture consistent with the overall results.  Monetary Policy Committee 79 37 The Agents had also asked about the adequacy of the existing labour force in relation to current output.  About 30% of respondents had reported that their current employment was more than adequate, whereas less than 20% had reported that their labour force was less than adequate.  In manufacturing, there had been many more firms who had reported that they were over-staffed than under-staffed, whereas in the service sector, there had been slightly more firms reporting an under-resourced rather than over-resourced labour force.  Some contacts had been recruiting staff even if their existing workforce had been more than adequate, either because they were expecting a significant upturn in demand conditions or because they had been recruiting different types of staff, perhaps with specialist skills. 38 The Agents also asked whether the quality of recruits had changed in the last 12 months.  Around two-thirds of their contacts had reported that the quality of recruits had been the same recently. There had been little evidence of lower quality recruits overall. However, in the service sector, especially retail, there had been more dissatisfaction with the recent quality of recruits than in manufacturing. VI Prices 39 Oil prices had risen by over 20% in March in response to an agreement to new OPEC production cuts.  The effect on RPIX inflation and GDP if oil prices were to remain at these levels was likely to be limited.  The Bank’s index of commodity prices excluding oil had fallen by 0.4% in February, and 1.2% including oil prices.  The trend in both measures had continued to be one of moderating deflation.  The measures to reform the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which had been agreed at the Berlin summit in March, included smaller and later price cuts than in the original proposals.  The 0.3% (upper-limit) effect on the RPI which had been estimated by MAFF on the basis of the original proposals was likely to be smaller in light of the agreement.  Producer price inflation had remained weak in February:  input prices fell by 0.1%—as in January, the movement had been largely accounted  for by the oil price (10% of the index);  output prices excluding excise duties had risen by 0.2%, to a level 0.6% lower than a year earlier.  The CIPS and CBI surveys had continued to suggest further falls.  40 Import prices had fallen by 0.6% in January whereas export prices had risen by 0.6%.  The difference between the annual rates of export and import price inflation had reached 1.5 percentage points in January, the largest difference since June 1997—though both had remained sharply negative (imports -4.9%, exports -3.4%). The GDP (market prices) deflator in the year to the fourth quarter of 1998 had grown by 2.6%, revised down from 2.8%.  The equivalent measure for the implied household consumption deflator had been revised up by 0.4 percentage points to 2.3%—close to the annual rate of RPIX inflation in the fourth quarter (2.5%).  The unit labour costs based measure of domestically generated inflation had become available again, and had continued to rise in the fourth quarter of 1998.   41 RPIX inflation had fallen by 0.2 percentage points to 2.4% in February;  both RPIY and RPI inflation had also fallen, to 1.8% and 2.1% respectively.  The fall had been largely due to goods price inflation falling by 0.3 percentage points to 1.1%.  The HICP inflation rate had also fallen, by 0.1 percentage points to 1.5%, for the same reasons as RPIX.  Annual RPIX inflation was likely to increase temporarily in March—largely due to the difference of timing of the budgets in 1998 and 1999—and fall in April. VII Reports by the Bank’s Agents 42 The Agents had reported on their general discussions with contacts.  Firms in the service sector had tended to report slower growth.  But conditions had remained fairly positive overall, particularly in leisure, finance and business services.  Growth in the retail sector had continued to be relatively weak, though there had been an increasing polarisation in performance between stores reporting quite strong growth and those reporting no growth or even falling sales volumes.  Service firms with an exposure to the manufacturing sector—such as road hauliers—had  experienced adverse trading conditions.  But Agents had felt that the rate of deterioration in manufacturing activity may have eased.  Stock corrections that had started in 1998 Q4 had largely been completed. But competition in the domestic market from imports had been increasing, particularly from European-based firms as European markets had remained relatively weak.  The exchange rate had remained a concern for UK exporters and was considered an obstacle to recovery.  Demand from the United States had continued to be strong and some East Asian markets had seen a rise in trade enquiries.  43 Construction sector activity had remained buoyant and this was expected to continue into next year.  Housing market activity had shown signs of improvement although it had remained fairly subdued in many areas.  But there was less construction work available beyond mid-2000.  Firms had suggested that public sector work was likely to be an important factor next year.  The outlook for investment more generally had remained positive, though still cautious, and the focus of spending had continued to be on improved efficiency and product development.  Investment in some sectors—such as oil and steel—had been reduced or moved overseas. 44 The service sector had continued to be the main provider of new jobs, though tighter control on numbers and increased flexibility had been evident.  More firms had been introducing annualised hours contracts and making more use of part-time and temporary contract staff.  There had been evidence that some firms were reluctant to shed staff as demand slowed because of likely recruitment difficulties in any upturn.  Natural wastage had been employed to reduce staff  numbers by small amounts.  Pay awards had moderated in both the manufacturing and service sectors, more so in manufacturing where there had also been a rise in the number of zero or deferred awards. VIII Market intelligence 45 There had been a broad market consensus that interest rates would be lowered in April, based on the improving inflation picture, with some also expecting an ECB rate cut.  Survey and asset price evidence had suggested a wider divergence of views on UK rates over the next year or two, based on alternative forecasts for growth and inflation up to 2000.  Long-term rates had fallen slightly over the past month.  Sterling had appreciated during 1999 versus the euro, and had appeared little affected by domestic factors in the month.  Some of the factors influencing sterling—such as demand related to merger and acquisition business—were thought to have been temporary, and there had been some evidence that the market saw downside risks over the next year.   Inflation Report:  May 1999 80 Text of Bank of England press notice of 8 April 1999 Bank of England reduces interest rates by 0.25% to 5.25% The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee today voted to reduce the Bank’s repo rate by 0.25% to 5.25%. The minutes of the meeting will be published at 9.30 am on Wednesday 21 April.  Monetary Policy Committee 81 The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee today voted to maintain the Bank’s repo rate at 5.25%. The Committee considered how policy should be set in the light of its latest inflation projection.  Since the February Inflation Report, there have been encouraging signs of recovering growth, and over the forecast period inflation is expected to be broadly in line with the 21/2% target. The projection takes account of the rise since February in sterling’s effective exchange rate, and assumes a decline from its present high level, at least in line with interest rate differentials.  If sterling were not to weaken as assumed, it is likely that inflation would undershoot the inflation target over the coming two years.  In those circumstances, depending on other developments in the economy, there might, therefore, need to be further easing of interest rates in order to keep inflation on track to meet the 21/2% target. The latest projections and analysis will appear in the Inflation Report to be published on Wednesday 12 May.   The minutes of the meeting will be published at 9.30 am on Wednesday 19 May.

1999-08-11,"Inflation Report August 1999 The Inflation Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff  under the guidance of the members of the Monetary  Policy Committee.  It serves two purposes.  First,  its preparation provides a comprehensive and  forward-looking framework for discussion among MPC  members as an aid to our decision making.  Second, its  publication allows us to share our thinking and explain  the reasons for our decisions to those whom they affect. Although not every member will agree with every  assumption on which our projections are based, the fan  charts represent the MPC’s best collective judgment  about the most likely path for inflation and output, and the  uncertainties surrounding those central projections. This Report has been prepared and published by the  Bank of England in accordance with section 18 of the  Bank of England Act 1998.

Over the past year, robust domestic demand—especially household consumption and business investment—has sustained annual GDP growth above 1%, despite the sharp deterioration in the trade position caused by the strength of sterling and global economic weakness. Those external factors have helped to subdue inflation, and domestic cost and price pressures have eased too.  In particular, rising employment has been accompanied by declining nominal pay growth. Prospects for the world economy have continued to improve since the May Report.  Activity in the United States remains buoyant, but growth may be starting to ease and interest rates have risen.  There are signs of a pick-up in the euro area, including some recovery in business confidence.  In Japan, strong growth was recorded in the first quarter, but sustained recovery of private domestic demand is not yet evident.  Prospects for many, but not all, emerging market economies in Asia and Latin America have also brightened.  The period of falling world prices may be coming to an end as activity recovers, and the oil price has risen sharply in recent months.  But risks to the global economic outlook remain.  Trade imbalances have widened further, and demand might be vulnerable to a fall in asset prices. Apart from two virtually flat quarters around the turn of the year, UK output is now estimated to have increased by 0.5% per quarter—close to the trend growth rate— from late 1997 to the second quarter of this year.  Over that period manufacturing output has declined while service sector growth has been strong.  In recent months, however, there are signs of some recovery in manufacturing activity. The domestic and external components of demand remain in sharp contrast.  Final domestic demand—ie excluding inventory investment—was 3.7% higher in 1999 Q1 than a year earlier.  Household consumption  ii Inflation Report:  August 1999 and business investment, both of which are now estimated to have been stronger than previously thought, grew by 3.3% and 11% respectively.  Inventory investment contributed negatively to overall demand growth as stock build-ups were corrected, especially in the winter quarters of flat output.  And net trade— exports less imports—made a negative contribution to growth of 2.3 percentage points.  Survey indicators point to strengthening activity. Consistent with the recent profile of output growth, business expectations and consumer confidence measures, which fell steeply in the autumn, have now recovered uniformly to their levels before the international economic turbulence of last year.  The Bank’s regional Agents also report that sentiment is improving, though perhaps less robustly than survey measures might suggest, and with significant sectoral and regional variation. Narrow money holdings have accelerated in recent months, but broad money growth has eased, largely on account of movements in financial company deposits. Credit growth—especially secured lending to households—has been buoyant, and the housing market has picked up, sharply in some areas.  The official interest rate was reduced by 0.25% to 5% in June, but money-market interest rates over the short to medium term have risen steeply since the May Report. Despite the slowdown in activity, employment has continued to rise, though modestly in recent months. The latest revisions to the National Accounts have increased measured productivity growth over the past year.  However—in contrast to the United States—UK productivity growth has been below trend since the  mid 1990s, but is expected to pick up.  Unemployment has declined further—to 6.2% on the Labour Force Survey measure, and to 4.4% on the claimant count, the lowest level since 1980.  The available evidence on vacancies, employment intentions, and skill shortages suggests that the labour market overall is tight but steady.   Nominal pay growth—an important indicator of domestic inflationary pressure—has eased further.  The annual growth rate of earnings per worker as measured by the Average Earnings Index declined to 4.3% in the three months to May, during which time the National Minimum Wage came into effect.  Public sector pay growth has risen, but private sector earnings growth has  iii Overview declined markedly.  Overall, recent wage settlements are on average about half a percentage point lower than a year ago.  Inflation expectations and average hours worked have fallen substantially over the same period, so the underlying trend in real earnings growth is less clear.  Nevertheless, pay pressures have been weaker than expected in relation to employment and output. The exchange rate is a key determinant of import price inflation.  Sterling strengthened further in May.  This, together with evidence of softening pay and price pressures, led the Monetary Policy Committee to reduce the official interest rate at its June meeting.  Sterling eased somewhat in July, and the starting-point for the exchange rate in the MPC’s current projections is slightly below the central path assumed in the May Report. The MPC’s current projection for the annual growth rate of GDP—based on the assumption that the official interest rate remains constant at 5%—is shown in  Chart 1.  The profile is stronger than the May projection. First, data revisions have increased estimated growth over the past year, so that the current growth rate is above 1% rather than below.  Second, growth prospects are judged to have strengthened in view of the improved outlook for consumer expenditure, the housing market, inventory investment and the international environment. In the central projection, annual growth rises to around 3% in 2001. The Committee’s best collective judgment of the prospects for RPIX inflation is shown in Chart 2.  The most likely outcome is for inflation to decline from its present level of 2.2% to below 2% over the next year or so, before rising slightly above target by the end of the two-year forecast period.  The balance of risks around this central projection is slightly on the upside. There is considerable uncertainty about the inflation outlook, and not all Committee members share the judgment about inflation prospects shown in Chart 2.  In particular, some Committee members prefer to base their central projection on an assumption that the nominal exchange rate stays constant, rather than declining on account of interest rate differentials.  This lowers the inflation profile—by around 0.4 percentage points at the two-year horizon—and slightly weakens the growth profile.  Some of these Committee members judge, moreover, that there are further downside risks to inflation from the possibility of lower profit margins or Chart 2 Current RPIX inflation projection based on constant nominal interest rates at 5.0% 1995 96 97 98 99 2000 01 0 1 2 3 4 5 2.5 Percentage increase in prices on a year earlier The fan chart depicting the probability distribution for inflation is rather  like a contour map.

However, these might be offset, at least in part, by greater upside risks from oil prices. Some other Committee members take the view that pay pressures are likely to be somewhat stronger than reflected in the projection in Chart 2.  This raises the inflation profile—by about 0.2 percentage points at the two-year horizon—but has little effect on the profile for GDP growth.   Weak world prices and the strong pound have helped to subdue inflation over the past two years.  Domestic inflationary pressure has eased as well, to an unexpected degree in relation to activity and employment, and inflation expectations have fallen substantially—to around the 21/2% target level.  The immediate outlook is for growth with low inflation.  The future relationship between output growth and inflation is less clear.  Given these uncertainties, the Monetary Policy Committee will pay close attention to emerging evidence on the links between activity, costs and prices, and the implications for the future path of inflation in relation to the target.

The MPC voted to cut the Bank’s repo rate by  0.25 percentage points to 5% on 10 June.  At its meetings in July and August, the MPC voted to maintain the rate at that level.  On 30 June, the US Federal Open Market Committee voted to raise the federal funds target rate by 0.25 percentage points to 5%, the first increase for two years.  Since the May Report, financial markets’ short-term interest rate expectations have risen in the United Kingdom, the United States and the euro area. The sterling exchange rate depreciated by 1.3% on a trade-weighted basis between 5 May and 4 August. Equity prices have fallen slightly in the United Kingdom, the United States and the euro area since the May Report, but have risen strongly in Japan.  UK house price inflation has picked up, and there is some indication of higher growth in commercial property prices. Growth in notes and coin rose strongly in the second quarter of 1999, and reached its highest annual rate in July since November 1996.  Although broad money growth has continued to slow, this is primarily owing to a contraction in the deposits of non-bank financial corporations.  The broad money holdings of households and non-financial corporations have been a little more robust, which seems consistent with the recent stronger evidence on domestic demand.  Growth in secured lending to individuals in the second quarter was high by recent historical standards, in line with greater housing market activity. 1.1 Money and credit Narrow money The value of notes and coin in circulation grew at an annualised rate of 8.8% in the three months to July (see Table 1.A), and the twelve-month growth rate rose to 7.3% (see Chart 1.1).(1) Some of this increase in growth is likely to reflect reductions in interest rates, which have lowered the opportunity cost of holding cash.  But stronger growth in notes and coin is also consistent with (1) After adjustment for the combined effect of the new £2 and 50 pence coins, the annual growth rate of notes and coin is estimated to have risen from 5.8% in April to 7.4% in July.

Broad money The annual rate of growth of M4 fell by 1.3 percentage points in the second quarter of 1999 to 5.6%, its sixth consecutive quarterly fall (see Chart 1.2).  M4 lending, which measures bank and building society lending to  the rest of the private sector, grew by 7.6% in the year  to Q2, 0.4 percentage points higher than in the first quarter. The relationship between M4 and aggregate spending is complicated by the fact that some M4 deposits are held as savings rather than for conducting transactions.  An alternative indicator is broad Divisia money, which is a weighted sum of M4 components designed to reflect better the transactions motive for holding deposits.  The amount of transactions services that a deposit provides is assumed to be inversely related to the associated interest rate.  So the higher the deposit rate, the more illiquid that deposit is assumed to be;  and the weight given to the deposit in the Divisia index is correspondingly lower. Divisia money growth was little changed in the second quarter at 7.0%, but was higher than M4 growth. The profile of aggregate M4 since 1995 has been driven primarily by other financial corporations (OFCs) (see Chart 1.3), which are non-bank financial intermediaries such as insurance companies, pension funds, unit trusts and securities and derivatives dealers.  Their money holdings are motivated more by portfolio considerations than by spending on goods and services.  This makes it particularly hard to draw implications about nominal demand from aggregate broad money growth.  But annual growth in households’ and private non-financial corporations’ (PNFCs’) deposits rose in the first half of 1999, and this seems more consistent with other evidence of a pick-up in domestic spending. Household sector Annual growth in households’ M4 deposits was 6.8% in the second quarter, 0.5 percentage points higher than in 1999 Q1.  Total net lending to individuals (ie households excluding non profit making institutions and unincorporated businesses), which includes lending by institutions other than banks and building societies,  grew by 8.1% in the year to 1999 Q2, its highest rate of growth since the fourth quarter of 1991 (see Chart 1.4).

Money and financial markets 5 Lending secured on dwellings accounts for around 80% of the stock of total lending to individuals.  Secured lending has picked up strongly, growing by 6.8% on a year earlier in 1999 Q2, its highest rate of growth since the second quarter of 1992.  And the value of loan approvals for house purchase rose sharply in March and has remained high.  To the extent that these housing transactions are completed, the outlook for future secured lending remains robust. As well as borrowing for house purchase, secured borrowing includes mortgage equity withdrawal (MEW), eg where a household releases a portion of its housing equity by increasing its existing mortgage.  Mortgage equity withdrawal may be picking up:  as a proportion of households’ post-tax income, the Bank’s estimate of MEW in the first quarter of 1999 was positive, having been negative for most of the 1990s, although the level remains low relative to the late 1980s (see Chart 1.5). Some of the mortgage equity withdrawal in the first quarter may feed through into future consumption, and continuing strength in property values could encourage further mortgage equity withdrawal. Growth in net unsecured lending remains strong in relation to nominal spending, but has been slowing in recent quarters (see Chart 1.4).  The twelve-month growth rate of unsecured lending to individuals was 14.2% in 1999 Q2, compared with the recent peak of 17.4% in the third quarter of 1998.  The fall in the growth rate may in part be the result of some households substituting unsecured borrowing with mortgage equity withdrawal. Private non-financial corporations PNFCs’ M4 deposits grew by 0.5% during the second quarter of 1999, following a very strong one-quarter growth rate of 4.5% in 1999 Q1.  So although the twelve-month growth rate fell to 7.6% in the second quarter from 9.2% in Q1, the rate is still somewhat higher than in 1998.  PNFCs’ M4 borrowing weakened slightly in the first half of the year.  But this measure captures only sterling borrowing from UK banks and building societies.  A broader measure of PNFCs’ financing, which includes foreign currency borrowing from banks and building societies and sterling and foreign currency capital market issues, grew strongly in the second quarter (see Chart 1.6).  Rising corporate borrowing may be related to stronger business investment, and possibly to greater merger and acquisitions activity.

Inflation Report:  August 1999 6 Other financial corporations (OFCs) OFCs’ deposits have contracted so far in 1999, following four years of strong growth.  The annual growth rate now stands at 1.1%, compared with 15.2% in the final quarter of 1998.  In contrast to the weakness in deposits growth, OFCs’ M4 lending picked up in the second quarter, growing by 10.3% on a year earlier, compared with 8.5% in 1999 Q1. 1.2 Interest rates and asset prices Short-term interest rates The MPC has successively reduced the Bank’s repo rate from 7.5% in October 1998 to its current level of 5%. Changes in official rates are quickly reflected in  short-term wholesale market rates, and therefore have an immediate impact on the interest income and payments of holders and issuers of short-term wholesale  money-market instruments.  Official rate changes also feed through into retail interest rates, but usually with a lag.  These lags may have lengthened recently.  Chart 1.7 shows that although the 200 basis point reduction in the Bank’s repo rate between October 1998 and March 1999 was quickly matched by reductions in retail deposit and lending rates, there has been little subsequent change in retail rates, although the repo rate was cut in April and June.  By dampening the impact of rate changes on variable retail rates, delayed pass-through may increase the lags inherent in monetary policy, or even diminish its effect. Expectations of future short-term nominal interest rates as measured by futures prices have risen since the  May Report by around 150 basis points at a two-year horizon, both in the United Kingdom and in the euro area (see Chart 1.8).  Expectations of short-term US interest rates have also risen, but by less.  Chart 1.9 shows the risk-neutral probability distribution of  three-month sterling interest rates derived from options prices on 4 August 1999.  The upward skew indicates that, in the market’s view, the balance of risks to  short-term UK interest rates over the next two years is on the upside. An important issue for monetary policy is whether higher nominal interest rates indicate a rise in the real cost of borrowing, because of higher risk-free real interest rates and/or higher inflation risk premia, or result from higher expected inflation.  But these components are not easy to measure.  The most direct measure of the Chart 1.8 Sterling and Euribor interest rate  expectations 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1996 97 98 99 2000 01 02 03 5 May 4 August Per cent 4 August 5 May Sterling Euribor Sources:  Bank of England, Bank for International Settlements and LIFFE.

The fan chart depicting the probability distribution for short-term interest  rates is rather like a contour map. At any given point, the depth of shading represents the height of the probability density function implied by the markets over a range of outcomes for short-term interest rates.  The markets judge that there is a 10% chance of interest rates being within the darkest, central band at any date.  Each successive pair of bands covers a further 10% of the probability distribution until 90% of the distribution is covered.  The bands widen as the time horizon is extended, indicating  increased uncertainty about interest rate outcomes.  Money and financial markets 7 risk-free real cost of borrowing is that derived from the prices of index-linked gilts.  The implied forward  risk-free real yield at a two-year horizon rose slightly to 1.8% on 4 August from 1.7% on 5 May.  But without a measure of the inflation risk premium the magnitude of the rise in the overall real cost of borrowing is hard to gauge. An alternative approach is to compare nominal interest rates with inflation expectations from surveys.   Table 1.B shows results from the Barclays Basix survey, which reports inflation expectations for both 12 months ahead and 12 to 24 months ahead, for five groups of professions and the general public.  Only business economists raised their 12 month ahead inflation expectations between the first and second quarters of 1999, by 10 basis points.  For 12 to 24 months ahead, higher inflation expectations in Q2 are a little more widespread, but the implication remains that much of the recent increase in short-term nominal interest rate expectations reflects higher expected real borrowing costs. Long-term interest rates Ten-year nominal spot interest rates on gilts rose by around 50 basis points to 5.2% between 5 May and  4 August.  Some of this increase reflects the higher short-term rates discussed above, but more than half of the rise is due to higher rates at the two to five-year horizon.  The rise in long-term UK interest rates may be part of a broader phenomenon:  long-term rates have been rising in the United Kingdom, United States and euro area for much of 1999 (see Chart 1.10).  Part of the reason for this may be higher global inflation expectations, as the outlook for world activity has improved and the oil price has strengthened. One channel through which higher long-term interest rates may influence domestic spending is via fixed-rate mortgages.  Banks and building societies commonly set fixed mortgage rates on the basis of the interest rate in the swap market, at which they can exchange the fixed income received on fixed-rate mortgages for  floating-rate income, in order to hedge their interest rate exposure.  Chart 1.11 shows that there is a fairly close relationship between fixed mortgage rates and swap rates.  Swap rates have risen so far in 1999 and, although fixed mortgage rates have also risen, the spread between swap rates and fixed mortgage rates is at a very low level.  It is possible therefore that fixed mortgage rates might increase further.

Inflation Report:  August 1999 8 Equity prices The FT-SE All-Share index fell by 1.4% between 5 May and 4 August, and US and European equity prices are also lower (see Chart 1.12).  But Japanese stock prices have risen strongly, reflecting an apparent improvement in the economic outlook following higher growth in Japanese output in the first quarter of this year.  The turbulence in world equity markets that followed the Russian debt crisis in August 1998 seems to have dissipated.  Uncertainty about future stock returns, as measured by implied volatilities from options prices, has fallen in all the major stock markets over the first half of 1999 (see Chart 1.13). Within the UK market, the FT-SE 100 index fell by 3% between 5 May and 4 August, compared with a 3% rise in the Mid 250 index and a 6% rise in the SmallCap index.  Insofar as larger UK stocks are more sensitive than smaller company stocks to international factors, the outperformance of smaller stocks may indicate an improvement in the outlook for the United Kingdom relative to the world economy over the past three months.  The MPC has assumed in its central projection that nominal UK equity wealth grows in line with nominal income. Property prices There are signs that house price inflation is increasing. The Halifax house price index rose by 6% in the three months to July on a seasonally adjusted basis, the highest rate since January 1989.  The annual rate of growth of the Halifax index was 8.2% in the year to  July 1999, while the Nationwide index grew by 6.9% (see Chart 1.14).  Also, the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors’ (RICS) June 1999 survey shows that 66% of chartered surveyors were reporting rising house prices over the previous three months, compared with 34% in June 1998.  House price rises in the first half of 1999 have been strongest in London and the South East (see Chart 1.15).  Although house price inflation in London and the South East led that in other UK regions in the late 1980s, evidence of a leading relationship in the 1990s is less clear. The MPC has reviewed its assumption about house price inflation.  In the past, the central assumption has been that house prices will grow in line with average earnings, so that the ratio of house prices to average earnings is constant over the MPC’s two-year forecast period.  But there have been periods in recent decades in which this ratio has risen quickly and substantially (see  Chart 1.12 Selected world share prices(a)(b) Jan. 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 Mar.

Money and financial markets 9 Chart 1.16).  The MPC has assumed in its central projection that house prices will grow at around  twice the pace of average earnings over the next two years. Evidence from a number of sources points to greater activity in the commercial property market.  First, the FTA Real Estate index has risen by 25% in 1999 compared with a 10% rise in the FT-SE All-Share index. Second, the Merrill Lynch-Gallup survey of UK fund managers has shown a positive balance in relation to UK property over the five months to July, compared with ten consecutive negative balances between May 1998 and February 1999.  Third, commercial property returns appear to be picking up.  The Investment Property Databank Ltd (IPD) calculates returns on UK commercial property on the basis of rents and changes in capital values.  Chart 1.17 shows that although  twelve-month property returns in June 1999 were  6 percentage points lower than in July 1998, three-month returns have been rising since the turn of the year, largely as a result of higher capital gains. Exchange rates The sterling effective exchange rate index (ERI) appreciated for much of the first half of 1999, peaking at 106.1 on 4 June (see Chart 1.18).  The MPC’s decision to cut the repo rate on 10 June was followed by a gradual fall in the index, and overall the ERI depreciated by 1.3% between 5 May and 4 August.  Underlying this was a 1.1% depreciation against the euro (which has a weight of 65% in the ERI).  The MPC’s assumptions regarding the path of sterling over the forecast period are discussed in Section 6. 1.3 Summary Growth in narrow money has risen strongly, and although aggregate broad money growth continues to slow, growth in the deposits of the non-financial private sector has been somewhat higher in 1999 so far.  The link from money growth to inflation is complicated in the short and medium term, but higher growth in money supports the projection of rising nominal demand growth.  Lending to individuals secured on dwellings has been growing more strongly, consistent with  greater activity in the housing market and a pick-up in house price inflation, and the MPC is now assuming that the ratio of house prices to average earnings will increase.

Nominal interest rate expectations have risen in the United Kingdom, especially around the two-year horizon.  It seems likely that part of this rise reflects a higher real cost of borrowing, as recent surveys have shown little movement in short-term inflation expectations.  But the continued rise in world long-term government bond yields suggests that investors may have revised upwards their expectations of global inflation over longer horizons.  UK equity prices have fallen slightly since the May Report, and the sterling exchange rate has depreciated.  11 Demand and output 2 GDP rose by 0.5% in 1999 Q2 following two quarters  of little growth.  The cumulative effect of the National Accounts revisions published on 29 July raised the level of GDP at constant market prices by 0.4% up to  1999 Q1, with upward revisions to private consumption and fixed investment.  Consumption growth has picked up in recent quarters, and the recovery in measures of consumer and business confidence seen at the time of the May Report has continued.  Domestic demand growth has been partly offset by continued negative contributions to growth from net trade, as import growth has remained strong and exports have been flat.  But the prospects for exports have improved since May, as the outlook for world growth and trade has strengthened.  2.1 External demand(1) Net trade has detracted from GDP growth each quarter since 1997 Q3, and over the year to 1999 Q1 made a negative contribution to growth of 2.3 percentage points—together with the previous two quarters, the largest for ten years.  The nominal deficit on trade in goods and services reached £4.4 billion in 1999 Q1 and the current account recorded a deficit of £2.5 billion. But the decline in the current account since the beginning of 1998 has been less marked than the widening of the trade deficit.  Higher investment income, resulting from returns on foreign direct investment, has partly offset the deficit on trade (see Chart 2.1).  A large proportion of UK foreign assets are held in the United States, so the strong performance of the US economy, and the US stock market, could help to account for this.  UK export volumes of goods and services fell by 1.1% over the year to 1999 Q1.  The slower growth of export volumes in 1997 and 1998 reflected the lagged effects of sterling’s appreciation and developments in non-EU economies, in particular the contraction of demand in emerging markets and oil-exporting economies (see Chart 2.2).  In recent quarters, however, export volumes of goods to EU economies have fallen whereas exports to economies outside the European Union have Chart 2.1 The UK current account, net investment  income and trade(a) 1994 95 96 97 98 99 Current account Investment income Net trade balance 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 + _ £ billions (a) At current market prices.

UK exports of goods to North America have grown at a fast rate, exports to Asia have risen and exports to the other non-EU economies have also picked up (see Table 2.A).  The strength of sterling against the euro and the slowdown in domestic demand in the larger European Union economies explain the widening of the UK trade deficit with the European Union.  The weakening of exports to the European Union is largely a result of falling export volumes to Germany, which accounts for some 13% of UK exports of goods.  Chart 2.3 shows that the United Kingdom’s export volume share of EU markets has declined since the beginning of 1997.    UK import demand depends on the strength of domestic demand, UK exports (which influence imports through re-export activity and demand for imported material inputs), the price of imports relative to domestically produced goods, and other factors such as changes in trade specialisation.  Chart 2.4 shows the extent of import penetration in the UK economy, measured by the ratio of import volumes to final expenditure (domestic demand and exports).  The upward trend is common for most countries.  It has been aided by progressive opening up of world markets, the reduction of trade protection and falling real transport costs.  UK import prices have fallen sharply compared with those for domestically produced goods since mid 1996.  This, combined with the recent outturns for domestic demand, would be expected to boost the volume of imports relative to domestic production and so accelerate import penetration.  However, import penetration has increased at a steady pace since 1995, with little noticeable acceleration following sterling’s appreciation.  Over the forecast period the MPC expects growth in domestic demand to be stronger than projected at the time of the May Report, but for import penetration to continue to rise at its recent steady pace. Looking ahead, the prospects for world growth and trade have improved further since the May Report.  The Asian Development Bank has projected stronger growth in 1999 for the emerging markets in Asia, with positive prospective growth overall for the newly industrialised economies (NIEs) and South East Asia.  Consensus Economics forecasts for Asia have been revised up. Forecasts for Latin America have improved marginally in July (see Chart 2.5), though perceptions of financial fragility in some parts of the region have increased since May.

Demand and output 13 Overall prospects in the major industrialised economies have also improved since May.  In the United States GDP grew by 4.1% in the year to 1999 Q2.  Annual GDP growth has been running at more than 3% for the past three years.  The timing or extent of any prospective slowdown in the US economy remains difficult to gauge. The outlook for Japan is a little brighter than three months ago:  industrial production was higher than expected in June and perhaps pointed to little change in GDP in Q2, rather than a fall.  Consensus Economics project slightly stronger activity in 1999 for Japan. Recent surveys of business confidence for France and Germany have pointed to a strengthening of growth in the second half of 1999 and in 2000. Taking all these developments together, the MPC expects world activity to be stronger than judged in May, as a result of higher US growth, and slightly brighter prospects for the euro area, Japan and developing economies.  That should increase world trade growth, and so the MPC’s central expectation for UK export market growth has been revised up to about 6% in 2000. A much lower negative contribution to GDP growth from net trade is expected in 2000 than in 1999.  But the MPC has assumed that there is a possible downside risk to world activity from a more pronounced slowdown in the US economy, for example linked to a steep decline in equity prices. 2.2 Domestic demand UK domestic demand rose by 0.7% in 1999 Q1, following an increase of 0.8% in 1998 Q4.  The National Accounts release on 29 July included revisions to domestic demand back to 1997.  The cumulative effect up to 1999 Q1 was to raise domestic demand by 0.7%, with upward revisions to consumption and investment. Consumption growth has strengthened since 1998 Q3 and business investment has also made a significant contribution to domestic demand growth (see Table 2.B). Quarterly growth of final domestic demand, which excludes the contribution from inventory investment, has been 1% or more for three consecutive quarters. Consumption The level of household consumption in the National Accounts was revised up and the cumulative effect of these revisions up to 1999 Q1 was 0.9%.  The slowdown in consumption growth in 1998 is now less marked than previously thought.  Consumption grew by 1.3% in  1999 Q1, up from 1.1% in 1998 Q4 (see Chart 2.6).  Part Chart 2.6 Household consumption growth 1990 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 Percentage changes Quarter on previous quarter Year on previous year Average annual growth rate (1955–99) + –  Inflation Report:  August 1999 14 of the increase in consumption in Q1 is likely to be erratic and is a result of the change of the registration date for new car sales from August to twice a year, in March and September.  That will have changed the seasonal pattern of vehicle spending and possibly boosted spending in the first quarter by around  1/4–1/2 percentage point.  But Table 2.C shows that the strength of consumption was broadly based.  More timely monthly indicators suggest that consumption growth may have remained robust in recent months.  Retail sales volumes rose by 0.9% in the three months to June.  The CBI Distributive Trades survey also pointed to a strengthening of retail demand;  the balance of retailers reporting a rise in sales compared with a year earlier rose to +20 in the three months to July from +10 in the previous three months.  However, retail contacts of the Bank’s regional Agents reported slow growth in retail sales in the latest three months, somewhat weaker than the evidence from the official data and other surveys.  The previous two Reports discussed possible reasons why the slowdown in consumers’ expenditure in 1998 appeared sharper than the MPC had expected, given the buoyancy of its main determinants (labour income and wealth).  The February and May Reports assumed that the relative weakness of consumers’ expenditure would persist, and would result in a slower pick-up in consumers’ expenditure over the forecast period than suggested by past behaviour.  But the latest data point to less of a slowdown in consumers’ expenditure in the first three quarters of 1998 and a strong recovery in 1998 Q4 and 1999 Q1 (even after adjusting for vehicle spending). That is more in line with past strong growth of labour income and wealth.  Therefore the MPC has revised its projection for consumers’ expenditure over the forecast period so that it is in line with past behaviour.  The MPC has also assumed that the risks to the forecast from consumption are on the upside over the next twelve to eighteen months.  The pattern of consumers’ expenditure growth over the past twelve months may have been linked to the turnaround in confidence, changes in official interest rates, and possibly to changes in equity and housing wealth.  Households aim to smooth expenditure by borrowing in response to short-term changes in income, and so will take into account expected future earnings and wealth when making spending decisions.  So changes in expectations about future earnings and wealth, and about Table 2.C Consumers’ expenditure on goods and services(a)(b) Percentage changes on a quarter earlier 1998 1999 Q3 Q4 Q1 Durable goods: Total 0.6 1.5 3.6 of which: Vehicles -0.8 2.3 3.6 Other durables 1.9 0.8 3.6 Non-durable goods: Total  -1.0 0.1 0.6 of which: Foods -1.0 -1.1 -0.3 Other goods -0.8 0.8 1.5 Clothing and footwear 1.4 0.0 2.9 Services 1.2 1.9 1.5 Total household expenditure 0.2 1.1 1.3 (a) At 1995 constant prices. (b) Seasonally adjusted.  Demand and output 15 the uncertainty surrounding them, can also affect spending.  Consumer confidence fell back sharply in the summer and autumn of 1998 in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, perhaps as a result of turbulence in global financial markets.  But since the beginning of 1999 confidence has improved and expectations of rising unemployment in the United Kingdom have fallen back (see Chart 2.7).  Household uncertainty about future employment and income appears to have diminished and that is likely to have contributed to the pick-up in expenditure.  Cuts in official interest rates since October 1998 are also likely to have led to a degree of substitution towards current, from future, consumption.  But the rise in medium-term yields since May, discussed in Section 1, might dampen the impact. Changes in wealth (financial and housing) may reflect changes in expectations about future income.  But changes in the composition of wealth may also indicate different paths for prospective aggregate consumption growth.  In the 1990s financial wealth has made a larger contribution than housing wealth to the increase in overall UK personal sector wealth, and the same is true for the United States (see Chart 2.8).  That contrasts with the 1980s when housing wealth was more important for the United Kingdom.   An increase in equity wealth may influence aggregate consumption less than an increase in housing wealth if the holders of equities tend to spend a lower proportion of any increase in income than homeowners (ie equity holders have a lower marginal propensity to consume). High-income households tend to have a lower propensity to consume than low-income households.  In the United Kingdom, as in the United States, equity wealth is skewed towards higher-income households, whereas housing wealth is more evenly distributed by income and net wealth (see Table 2.D).  This may mean that expenditure is less sensitive to an increase in equity wealth than housing wealth.  Furthermore, since around two thirds of household equity wealth in the United Kingdom is held indirectly by pension funds and insurance companies, it may be more difficult to use this form of wealth as collateral for borrowing. UK housing wealth began to rise as a proportion of total household wealth in 1998 and house prices appear to have accelerated in the first half of 1999, perhaps linked to the recovery in confidence.  An increase in house prices, relative to other goods and services, would Chart 2.7 Expectations of a rise in unemployment over  the next twelve months(a) 20 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 1988 90 92 94 96 98 Percentage balances   + _ Source:  GfK.

But an increase in house prices also raises the costs facing first-time buyers or those trading up to larger properties—and they may cut back on other forms of spending to invest in housing. This would tend to dampen the overall effect on expenditure on non-housing goods and services.  But a rise in housing wealth can boost the expenditure of homeowners who are able to use their house as  collateral against borrowing.  Latest data show that this may be beginning to happen.  Estimates of mortgage equity withdrawal were positive in 1999 Q1, having been negative most of the time since 1992.  Mortgage equity withdrawal may have partly substituted for unsecured borrowing (see Section 1).  Over the  forecast period house prices and therefore housing wealth and mortgage equity withdrawal are expected to strengthen. An increase in housing transactions could also influence consumers’ expenditure by bringing forward or raising spending on durables.  The number of loans approved and particulars delivered have risen by 17% and 8% respectively since mid 1998.  The pattern of durables spending since 1997 is also likely to have been influenced by the ‘windfall payouts’ from building society conversions.(1) Spending on durables is likely  to have been moved forward into 1997 and, as  Chart 2.9 shows, spending slowed markedly from the end of 1997.  The rise in 1999 Q1 might reflect some recovery to a more usual pattern of spending, given housing market transactions.  Further ‘windfall payouts’ are expected next year from, for example, the transfer of Scottish Widows’ business to the Lloyds TSB Group, and other demutualisations.  The estimated value of these is around a quarter of the size of the 1997 windfalls.  The turn of the Millennium may have some impact on the profile of consumers’ expenditure.  The Bank’s regional Agents have reported that firms in the food and drink sector are anticipating a greater than usual seasonal strengthening of demand in the second half of the year and are likely to build up stocks in advance.  Households are likely to stock up on these goods more than usual at the end of this year, for both celebratory and precautionary reasons.  To the extent that such spending is precautionary, it may bring forward expenditure that would otherwise have occurred in 2000 Q1.  This could affect the pattern of retail spending and inventory holding by firms around the end of the year.

Chart 2.10 Investment by sector Chart 2.11 Company profits and GDP growth Demand and output 17 Investment demand Whole-economy investment rose by 0.2% in 1999 Q1 and was 5.9% higher than a year earlier, following annual increases in investment of more than 7% every quarter since 1997 Q2.  Upward revisions to investment in 1997 and 1998 reflected new estimates for investment expenditure on computer equipment.  Business investment grew by 0.5% in the first quarter and was 11% higher than a year earlier (see Chart 2.10). The difference between current and desired capital stock levels is the major influence on investment, though costs may mean that adjustment to the desired capital stock is slow.  The desired capital stock cannot be measured but it, and therefore investment, will be affected by firms’ current profitability, their expectations of future demand and profits, the cost of capital, capacity utilisation and changes in technology.  Latest estimates suggest that total company profits have fallen substantially since early 1998, but these data are often subject to revision.  In 1999 Q1 total company profits were around 9% lower than a year earlier, excluding a statistical alignment adjustment used by the ONS to help balance the National Accounts.  Profits of private non-financial corporations (PNFCs) have fallen back from a peak in 1998 Q3 and were around 6% lower than a year earlier in 1999 Q1, also excluding the alignment adjustment.  The extent of the decline in profits therefore seems large, given that output in the whole economy grew by more than 1% over this period (see Chart 2.11).  Other evidence on the current state of company profits does not point to such a sharp decline: CBI business confidence has improved since mid 1998. The number of profit warnings was 6% higher in the first seven months of 1999 than in the same period in 1998. Investment in manufacturing and services has reflected the divergence between these sectors over the past two years.  In 1999 Q1 manufacturing investment was at its lowest level for more than two years.  But BCC and CBI measures of business confidence in the manufacturing sector have improved since the May Report.  The July CBI quarterly Industrial Trends survey reported that business optimism had recovered to a balance of 5%, the highest since the beginning of 1997.  And spare capacity was broadly in line with its historical average.  However, investment intentions, as measured by the BCC survey, suggested only weak increases in manufacturing investment in 1999 Q2—well below the average since the series began in 1989 (see Chart 2.12).

Inflation Report:  August 1999 18 Service sector investment has made an increasing contribution to overall business investment since 1993, as Chart 2.13 shows.  It accounted for 70% of total business investment in 1999 Q1, up from less than 50% in 1993;  annual growth in services’ investment has been close to 20% since 1998 Q2.  Increasing investment in computer technology has probably boosted service sector investment, as discussed in the May Report. Profit expectations, as measured by the BCC, have also recovered since the autumn of 1998.  The  BCC survey measure of capacity utilisation has increased a little and investment intentions are broadly in line with the  long-run average.  These suggest that further growth in service sector investment is likely.  Real general government investment fell by 6.2% in 1999 Q1 and was 2% higher than a year earlier.  But the  fall in Q1 is likely to be erratic.  The March Budget maintained the Government’s commitment to  increase the ratio of net public investment to GDP  to 1% by financial year 2001–02.  The growth rate of gross government investment is therefore likely to increase. The prospects for business investment are little changed from the May Report.  The profile continues to be influenced by the bringing forward of some investment spending on construction projects and IT in advance of the Millennium.  This is offset in 2000 by a slowdown in investment growth. Inventory investment Whole-economy inventories (excluding a statistical alignment adjustment) fell in 1999 Q1, following a build-up in inventories in 1998 (see Chart 2.14).  Firms have over time economised on inventory investment relative to output, as is evident from the long-run downward trend in the ratio of inventories to GDP.  Inventories will vary relative to output during a business cycle.  For example, a sharp drop in demand is likely to result in a build-up in inventories above desired levels. There is some evidence that this happened in mid 1998 when the CBI and CIPS manufacturing surveys both pointed to higher than desired stocks of finished goods.  The survey measures and official data have fallen back since then, suggesting that some adjustment has taken place (see Chart 2.15).  Since 1994 the inventories-to-GDP ratio has been broadly stable, compared with a long-run decline in the Chart 2.13 Business investment and the service  sector 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 Per cent Percentage change on a year earlier Business investment  growth  (left-hand scale)       Contribution of services to  the level of business investment  (right-hand scale)  10 5 0 5 10 15 20 + – 1993 94 95 96 97 98 99 Chart 2.14 Change in inventories(a) 1,600 1,200 800 400 0 400 800 1,200 1,600 + _ Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Other Distributive trades  Manufacturing  1998 99 £ millions Chart 2.15 Inventories of finished goods(a) 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Per cent Long-run average 1990–99 30 1994 95 96 97 98 99 Per cent balance 35 40 45 50 55 60 50 indicates a neutral level of  inventories CBI:  above desired levels(b) CIPS(c) Sources:  CBI, CIPS Manufacturing Survey.

Demand and output 19 ratio since the mid 1970s.  Changes in manufacturing largely accounted for the downward trend in inventories as a proportion of GDP, as Chart 2.16 shows, whereas distributive trades’ inventories have remained broadly constant.  Over time, it is likely that increased integration of production processes, through new technologies, has improved the efficiency of production.  That may have reduced the need for ‘work in progress’ inventories as a proportion of manufacturing output (see Chart 2.17). The change in pattern within the UK manufacturing sector away from traditional heavy engineering and towards new-technology industries has probably reduced the scale of work in progress inventories.  Changes in technology (for example business-to-business use of the Internet) are likely to continue to reduce inventories as a proportion of GDP.  The MPC has assumed that the downward trend will continue, but at a slower pace than in the 1970s and 1980s. Public sector demand Nominal general government consumption rose by 3.8% in the year to 1999 Q1.  In assessing the outlook for the public finances, the MPC has maintained as its central case the nominal government expenditure plans and effective tax rates from the 9 March Budget statement. The Government’s current nominal expenditure plans are for an increase in spending on goods and services of 5.3% in financial year 1999–2000.  The overall stance of fiscal policy is the same as in the May Report.  HM Treasury projects a structural tightening in terms of the cyclically adjusted net borrowing position of some 0.3% of GDP between 1998–99 and 2000–01. 2.3 Output According to preliminary estimates, GDP (at constant market prices) grew by 0.5% in 1999 Q2.  The annual growth rate remained at 1.2% (see Chart 2.18).  The changes to the National Accounts for the 1999 Blue  Book resulted in revisions to the output side of the accounts which raised the level of output by 0.4% and increased the annual growth rate in 1999 Q1 to 1.2% from 0.7%.   Growth in the service sector was 0.5% in 1999 Q2 and annual growth was 2.4%.  Latest data for 1999 Q1 showed that output in the production and agricultural sectors had continued to contract (see Chart 2.19). Agricultural output has been falling since 1997.  But agriculture has been affected by sector-specific shocks, which are discussed in the box on pages 20–21.

Inflation Report:  August 1999 20 The three main sectors of UK agriculture are:  arable crops and horticulture, which accounted for around 38% of the value of agricultural output in 1998;  livestock which accounted for 33%;  and dairy farming which accounted for 19%.  The sector accounted for around 1.3% of GDP at basic prices in 1998, down from 2% in 1989.  Agriculture’s share of the United Kingdom’s workforce in employment was around 2% in 1998, down from just under 21/2% in 1989.  Many more people are indirectly dependent on the agricultural sector within rural communities and supporting industries.  Chart A shows how agricultural sector output has evolved very differently from the economy as a whole.  This is partly because agriculture often faces specific supply and demand shocks that are different from those faced by other sectors.  For example the sharp drop in agricultural production recorded by the National Accounts at the beginning of 1993 was the result of a change in the Common Agricultural Policy:  land set aside from arable farming was increased and that was excluded from production.  But it is also the case that some  whole-economy shocks, such as exchange rate changes, have a bigger impact on agriculture than on some other sectors. Over the past three years there have been a number of developments that have had severe adverse effects on the United Kingdom’s agricultural sector.  World dollar agricultural prices fell sharply in 1998, following the financial crises and compression of demand from Asia and Latin America.   Within the European Union, and in the United Kingdom, the prices of cereals, meat and dairy products are set by the system of support prices with reference to  Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).  These products account for more than two thirds of total agricultural output in the United Kingdom.  Support prices are set in euros (Ecu prior to January 1999) and although they were reduced between 1992 and 1995 they have been broadly unchanged since then.  Sharp falls in world agricultural prices have resulted in an increased divergence between world prices and high EU euro support prices for cereals, meat and dairy products. But sterling prices of these products have fallen sharply since 1996, as sterling has appreciated against other European currencies and the euro.  Chart B shows how changes in the Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Fishing (MAFF) agricultural price index are broadly influenced by exchange rate changes.  But prices of some products such as root crops have moved very differently from cereals, dairy and livestock prices (see Chart C).  Farmers have been partly compensated for lower support prices by subsidies to income.  Following the reforms to the CAP which came into effect in the mid 1990s, total direct subsidies (net of levies) received by UK farmers reached a peak of £4.1 billion in 1996–97.  In 1998–99 these fell back to £3.3 billion, reflecting reduced payments relating to lower payouts from the Bovine  Agriculture The share of the agricultural sector in GDP has contracted in recent years, and income from agriculture has fallen sharply. In 1998 it was around 40% lower than its average for the 1990s.  Falling world commodity prices and the appreciation of sterling’s effective exchange rate have had a marked effect on the sector.  Product-specific shocks and longer-term factors have also affected the balance of supply and demand for commodities.  As with the other primary sectors, agricultural output is more volatile than whole-economy GDP.

Demand and output 21 Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) schemes and lower payments for the wheat and barley Arable Area scheme. In addition to these developments, there have been a number of specific shocks to demand for UK produce. The main shock was the reduction in demand for beef following the BSE crisis in March 1996.  That has reduced the livestock output of cattle and calves by 23%. The BSE crisis has also had knock-on effects on other livestock prices.  It prompted a further switch from world beef production towards other meat such as lamb, pork and poultry.  Production has increased rapidly in some of these sectors in recent years, resulting in a sharp decline in wholesale prices for these products. All of these developments contributed to the sharp fall in farming incomes;  in 1998 they were around 30% lower than in 1997 and around 40% lower than the average for the 1990s.  Information from the Farm Business Surveys suggests that reductions in income were seen across most types of farming between financial year 1997–98 and 1998–99.  Despite the cheaper cost of feedstuffs, incomes in the dairy sector fell because of lower milk prices. Overseas competition led to lower incomes in cattle and sheep farming. The latest summary of business conditions by the Bank’s regional Agents suggests that the strength of sterling continued to bear down on incomes in the first half of 1999, and UK farmers may have lost market share to the overseas sector.  Confidence has been very weak and declined a little through the second quarter, perhaps reflecting the strength of sterling against the euro over that period.  However, this was partly offset by the  recent stabilisation of some commodity prices (see Section 4). Looking ahead, the outlook for world prices of commodities has firmed since the May Report, as a result of improved prospects for world growth and trade.  This may be reflected in higher agricultural demand within the European Union over coming quarters.  The reforms to the CAP agreed under Agenda 2000 will reduce the prices of cereals, livestock, and dairy products, and move them closer to world prices.  That may also raise EU demand.  Overall this is likely to have a further impact on farm incomes from 2000, though increases in direct payments to farmers will partly offset the effect of lower support prices.  The Agenda 2000 agreement includes cuts in support prices of 15% for cereals and 20% for beef, phased in over two and three years, respectively, from 2000.  Cuts in support prices for dairy products have been delayed until 2005–06. The reforms are likely to have different effects on the arable, dairy and livestock sectors.  MAFF estimates  that, in the absence of structural adjustment, specialist arable farmers would lose revenues as a result of the reforms, but beef and sheep farmers would gain overall. Greater pressure on the European Union to open up further its agricultural markets is likely to arise from World Trade Organisation negotiations which begin  in 2000.  In addition, the EU countries may reconsider  the CAP in the context of discussions over EU enlargement.   As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, the lifting of the worldwide ban on exports of beef on 1 August should gradually improve the prospects for the sector.  The outlook for agriculture as a whole could improve as world commodity prices become firmer.  But developments will continue to depend on sterling’s exchange rate against the euro.  The agricultural sector also remains vulnerable to supply shocks that make production more volatile than in other sectors of the economy. The pick-up in service sector growth in Q2 and survey evidence point to a renewed strengthening of growth. The BCC services survey reported higher home deliveries in Q2, together with an improvement in orders.  The CIPS services survey has also shown a turnaround in overall and new business activity, which rose to their highest levels since March 1998.

Inflation Report:  August 1999 22 Manufacturing output growth was revised up by  0.3–0.4 percentage points in 1997 and 1998.  But the pattern of growth was little changed.  In recent months the contraction in the production industries has diminished.  In 1999 Q2 manufacturing output rose by 0.4%, following three quarters of falling output, and was 1.2% lower than a year earlier.  Survey data suggest that manufacturing may have reached a turning-point.  The July CIPS purchasing managers’ index rose to 52.7 and was above the neutral level of 50, indicating an expansion rather than contraction in activity.  The CIPS total new orders and export orders indicators rose significantly in July.  And the CBI and BCC survey responses on domestic and export orders have also improved since the end of 1998. Construction output rose by 0.2% in 1999 Q1 and activity appears to have continued to rise in Q2.  New construction orders rose in the three months to May. And the CIPS survey measure of total construction activity rose to 64.5 in June, well above the average of 48.5 in the second half of 1998.  But housing starts were a little lower in the latest three months.   2.4 Summary The cumulative effect of the revisions to the National Accounts was to raise the level of GDP by 0.4% up to 1999 Q1, with upward revisions to consumption and fixed investment.  Consumers’ expenditure has strengthened since 1998 Q3 and the recovery in measures of consumer and business confidence seen at the time of the May Report has been maintained.  The MPC has raised the profile of consumers’ expenditure over the forecast period.  The overall prospects for activity have improved since the May Report. Developments in the world economy have been moderately favourable over the past three months and the MPC has revised up its projection for world activity and trade.  Compared with the May Report, the MPC’s central projection is for a sharper increase in GDP growth in the near term, before levelling off at around 3% a year.

The LFS unemployment rate has remained stable at around 6.2%, lower than its previous trough in 1990, and the claimant count has fallen close to 20-year lows.  Growth in employment and hours has slowed, but forward-looking indicators no longer suggest that whole-economy employment will fall substantially, and some point to a pick-up in growth.  Despite the persistent strength of labour demand relative to expectations, nominal earnings growth has continued to decline.  The headline Average Earnings Index measure of annual earnings growth fell to 4.3% in May, reflecting the significant reduction in private sector settlements relative to a year ago—partly because of lower inflation expectations— and a moderation of other pay elements sensitive to movements in economic activity, including overtime and bonuses. 3.1 Earnings Whole-economy annual earnings growth fell from a peak of 5.7% last June to 4.3% in May, according to the headline measure of the official Average Earnings Index (AEI), a backward-looking three-month average (see Chart 3.1).  Recent monthly AEI outturns have been volatile:  the measured twelve-month growth rate of average earnings rose from a low point of 4.2% in December to 5.0% in February, before falling back to 4.0% in April and May.  Following the recent independent review of the AEI,(1) the ONS is carrying out further work to improve the quality of the index, focusing in particular on updating and expanding the sample of reporting firms.  While this work is taking place, the MPC has agreed that the path of earnings growth should be treated as more than usually uncertain. In forming its central projection, the MPC continues to take account of a range of other indicators of pay pressures. (1) Review of the revisions to the Average Earnings Index:  Report submitted by Sir Andrew Turnbull and Mervyn King to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, prepared by Peter Sedgwick and Martin Weale, The Stationery Office Limited, March 1999.  The main findings and recommendations of the Report are summarised in the box on page 24 of the May 1999 Inflation Report.

(a) Twelve-month private sector mean, weighted by sectoral employment  shares from the 1996 Annual Employment Survey. Sources:  Barclays Basix survey and ONS. The decline in the official measure of earnings growth since last June is more than accounted for by a slowdown in the growth of private sector pay (see Chart 3.1).  Other indicators also point to an easing in private sector wage pressures.  The Reward Index of earnings growth—based on an independent survey covering almost 900,000 employees, predominantly in the private sector—fell  to 3.6% in June, and the Bank’s twelve-month  employment-weighted measure of private sector settlements declined to 3.5% (see Chart 3.2).   Shorter-term measures have been even weaker:  the average private sector settlement in the three months to May was 3.0%, 0.8 percentage points lower than a year earlier, and the lowest since 1994.  The three-month average picked up in June, as the final stage of a  three-year pay deal for construction workers came into effect.  But average settlements in other parts of the private sector were stable. The factors accounting for the decline in private sector settlements appear broadly based.  Table 3.A, drawn from the CBI’s settlements survey, shows how firms’ views of the key influences on pay settlements have changed since last year.  A reading of -17 against ‘cost of living’, for example, shows that the balance of firms identifying increases in the cost of living as a very important upward pressure on pay settlements has fallen by 17 percentage points between last year’s settlements round and this.  In all but two of the categories in the table, pay pressures are perceived to have weakened compared with a year ago.  Lower growth in orders and profits, and reduced concerns about recruitment and retention, have been key factors, but the most important single influence has been the fall in the growth of the cost of living, or inflation. Inflation affects nominal earnings growth in several ways.  During pay negotiations, wage-bargainers need to form expectations of future inflation in order to assess the real value of pay offers.  For a given rate of expected real wage growth, lower inflation expectations imply lower nominal wage growth.  Inflation expectations will be influenced by various factors, in particular the credibility of the monetary policy framework, but also the cyclical position of the economy, and recent inflation outturns.  As Chart 3.3 shows, current inflation and a representative survey measure of expected inflation have both fallen over the past year or so.  Inflation outturns also affect the real value of the wage received over the past year relative to that anticipated a year ago.  When inflation is higher than expected, real wage growth will Table 3.A Change in factors affecting private sector settlements between 1997/98 and 1998/99(a) Change in balance Services Manufacturing Cost of living -17 -17 Profits -14 -13 Recruitment/retention -5 -13 Orders -3 -12 Ability to adjust prices 1 -4 Productivity 5 -1 Source:  CBI Pay Databank Report. (a) The table shows the change in the balance of firms identifying the factors  shown as ‘very important’ upward pressures on settlements between 1997/98 (1.8.97–31.7.98) and 1998/99 (1.8.98–30.6.99).  The labour market 25 be correspondingly lower, which may put some upward pressure on settlements as wage-earners seek to recoup lost real income.  In fact, as Chart 3.3 shows, inflation on the RPI measure has been rather lower than bargainers expected over the past year.  So higher-than-expected real wage growth over the past year may also have been a factor reducing upward pressures on this year’s settlements. In addition to the basic wage settlement, recent growth in earnings per worker will have reflected many other influences, including changes in overtime and bonuses, and individual payments to meet the requirements of the National Minimum Wage (NMW).  Annual growth in overtime has continued to fall, consistent with the slowdown in annual output growth.  According to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), the average number of paid overtime hours per worker fell by 10% in the three months to May, compared with the same period a year earlier.  The recent behaviour of bonuses is less clear.  A large part of the slowdown in the headline AEI measure between last summer and January this year reflected lower measured growth in bonuses, consistent with the weaker growth in profits in the preceding period.  In February, however, the ONS changed the way in which bonus data are collected,(1) which—although beneficial in the longer term—means that neither the official data on annual bonus growth, nor those on annual growth in regular pay (calculated by subtracting measured bonuses from total pay), can be used as reliable indicators of the true bonus contribution to annual earnings growth until February 2000.  The Bank’s regional Agents report that, in some sectors and regions, where profits and orders growth have remained strong or where there have been persistent skill shortages, pressures to maintain bonuses remain.  But overall, bonuses and other special payments appear to have been somewhat weaker in the first half of 1999 than they were in 1998, when bonuses were unusually strong.  So lower bonuses have probably contributed to the further slowdown in annual earnings growth. The slowdown in private sector earnings growth may also indicate a weaker-than-expected initial impact from the National Minimum Wage, which came into force on 1 April.  The NMW affects about 1.9 million workers directly, and—assuming full implementation and no (1) Previously, firms were asked to report bonuses only when there had been a ‘significant’ change.  Since February, they have been asked to report all bonuses paid.  Inflation Report:  August 1999 26 other behavioural responses—would imply a rise of some 0.6% in the whole-economy pay bill.  In previous Reports, the MPC assumed that the actual impact on the level of earnings in 1999 Q2 would be a little lower than this, as the effects of anticipation, substitution, mitigation and any non-compliance more than outweighed upward pressure from differentials restoration.(1) It is too soon to assess these assumptions against the outturns.  The Average Earnings Index is unlikely to capture the full effect of the NMW, because a disproportionate number of those entitled to a pay rise from the NMW work in firms that are too small to be selected for the AEI sample.  Nor do the latest hourly wage distribution data from the LFS—which cover the period March-May—provide a clear guide:  it is unclear how much of the distribution reflects pay received after 1 April, and some LFS survey respondents are known to have a tendency to  under-report average hourly pay levels.  The ONS has a method of adjusting for this bias, but it requires data from the 1999 New Earnings Survey, and these will not become available until October.  Given these uncertainties, the MPC has decided not to adjust its assumptions about the impact of the NMW on earnings growth in the central projection until a clearer picture emerges later in the year.  But the risk of a more substantial upward effect has been removed. In contrast to the slowdown in private sector earnings growth, public sector pay growth has risen (see  Chart 3.1).  The pick-up in growth since mid 1997 may reflect something of a stabilisation in average relative pay rates, after a period in which average earnings in the public sector fell quite sharply compared with those in the private sector (see Chart 3.4).  But the direct implications for RPIX inflation of these latest movements are likely to be relatively modest.  First, although public pay was boosted in April by the implementation of the pay review body awards, some of the rise in the annual growth rate will be temporary, reflecting the fact that, whereas this year’s awards were applied in full from April, many of last year’s settlements were staged, with part of the settlement delayed until December 1998 (see Chart 3.5).  This effect will unwind at the end of this year.  Second, rises in public sector pay have little direct impact on measured inflation, because few public sector services are included in the RPIX basket.  Third, the impact on domestic demand is unlikely to differ much from that already implied by the Government’s published fiscal plans, as long as this year’s pay awards do not Chart 3.4 Ratio of public sector to private sector  earnings(a) 90 92 94 96 98 100 102 104 106 108 1990 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 1995 = 100 Chart 3.5 Public sector wage bill(a) Nurses 10% Doctors 7% Civil service 12% Other NHS 8% Teachers 12% Other (mainly public corporations) 19% Other local authority 20% NHS Local authority Other Staff receiving staged  settlements in 1998/99 Other review bodies 7% Police and fire 6% Source:  HM Treasury.

The labour market 27 cause the Government to overshoot its expenditure targets.  Given the path of government spending, the effects on aggregate demand of a change in the share of this spending allocated to pay are likely to be limited. Finally, it is possible that the rise in public sector pay growth may put some upward pressure on private sector wages.  Such effects may be stronger when the overall labour market is relatively tight, as it has been recently. But econometric evidence suggests that, over the past  20 years, changes in public sector pay have typically followed, rather than led, changes in private sector pay. 3.2 Employment and unemployment Employment growth has continued to slow, but less rapidly than had been expected at the turn of the year. LFS employment, a measure of the number of people in work based on a continuous survey of households, rose by 20,000 (0.1%) in the three months to May, compared with a rise of 79,000 (0.3%) in the previous three months.  Workforce jobs, a measure of the number of jobs in the economy based on a quarterly survey of firms, fell by 4,000 in Q1, as a 51,000 fall in manufacturing employment was only partly offset by a rise in the number of service sector jobs.  Growth in Workforce jobs has been rather weaker than growth in LFS employment in recent quarters (see Chart 3.6), but these differences are not unusually large.  The two series measure slightly different employment concepts and use different sampling methods.(1) The number of hours worked is in principle a better measure of labour usage.  Growth in total hours worked has fallen more sharply than employment growth since the middle of last year (see Chart 3.6), reflecting a decline in average hours worked per person.  The combination of flat or rising employment and falling average hours is likely to reflect a number of factors. First, the Bank’s regional Agents report that, in some sectors and regions facing lower demand growth, firms have sought to avoid the costs of hiring and firing more highly skilled staff by cutting overtime and other hours rather than employment, in the expectation that demand would pick up again relatively soon.  Second, since last summer there has been a slight rise in the share of employment accounted for by part-timers, who typically work about 40% of the hours of full-timers.  And third, some of the decline since October in the share of employees working longer hours (see Chart 3.7) may Chart 3.6 Growth in employment and hours(a) 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 1996 97 98 99 Percentage changes on a year earlier LFS employment  LFS total hours worked  Workforce jobs (a) Workforce jobs data adjusted for a discontinuity in 1995.

Inflation Report:  August 1999 28 reflect the effects of the introduction of the Working Time Directive, which places restrictions on working more than 48 hours a week. The continued strength of employment in the face of the slowdown in annual demand growth implied a further decline in labour productivity growth in 1999 Q1, although the upward revisions to GDP, discussed in Section 2, have raised the level relative to previous estimates.  Annual growth in the official measure of productivity per worker fell from 1.1% in 1998 Q4 to 1.0% in Q1.  Hourly productivity growth has been rather higher in recent quarters, reflecting the more rapid slowdown in hours worked, but it also fell in Q1.  The decline in productivity growth raised unit wage cost growth further, to 4.4% in Q1 (see Chart 3.8).   Since 1995, productivity growth has been below its  long-run trend.  There is no strong evidence that the trend growth rate has shifted.  But the cyclical movements in productivity growth around this trend have been rather less pronounced during the 1990s, consistent with the possibility that changes in the structure of the labour market over the past two decades have given firms greater scope to vary both employment and hours worked in response to changes in current and expected demand.  It is also possible that some of the slower growth in the second half of the 1990s reflects a one-off shift in the average level of productivity, consistent with labour market reforms encouraging new workers into the labour market.  In its central projection, the MPC has attached some weight to both of these possibilities. Growth in productivity per worker is projected to rise back above its trend rate over the forecast period, but the level of productivity is expected to remain somewhat lower than that implied by previous trends. The short-run outlook for productivity growth partly depends on the path of employment growth.  Surveys paint a mixed picture, but none suggests that a sharp fall in employment is likely over the next three to six months, and some indicate a modest recovery in expectations.  Measures of firms’ employment intentions from the British Chambers of Commerce and the Confederation of British Industry have picked up since the previous Report (see Table 3.B), and growth in demand for permanent and temporary staff across a range of sectors has recovered a little since the turn of the year, according to the Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services (FRES).

The labour market 29 newspaper recruitment advertising with figures on the number of vacancies at Jobcentres,(1) remain consistent with a small decline in whole-economy employment in the coming months (see Charts 3.9 and 3.10). Pay pressures are influenced by, among other things, the gap between the demand for, and the effective supply of, labour.  Although increments to the labour supply are typically drawn from those without work, not all of these people exert the same degree of influence on wages.  In its central projection, the MPC pays particular attention to those searching for, and available for, work.  The LFS unemployment rate—a measure of the size of this group—has remained broadly stable since last summer at around 6.2%, lower than the previous cyclical trough in 1990.  The claimant count rate, another measure of unemployment based on the number of people receiving benefit and available for work, was 4.4% in June, close to 20-year lows (see Chart 3.11).  Recent unemployment outturns have been lower than expected at the start of the year, and most external forecasters have lowered their projections for the path of unemployment over the next two years. Earnings growth has been unexpectedly weak, given the persistently low level of unemployment.  As discussed above, much of the decline in nominal earnings growth since last summer reflects lower inflation expectations and the cyclical decline in profits, productivity and output growth, rather than the direct impact of labour market conditions.  Growth in real unit labour costs— nominal earnings and other labour costs adjusted for inflation and productivity—has continued to pick up, consistent with some upward pressure from labour market tightness.  But, for given rates of unemployment, real unit labour cost growth has been considerably weaker in the 1990s recovery than it was at a similar point in the previous cycle (see Chart 3.12).  It is possible that this reflects a decline in the equilibrium rate of unemployment, consistent with labour market reforms and structural changes in the economy over the past two decades.  But it is impossible to say with any certainty where this rate currently lies. Another potential reason for the weakness of real earnings growth relative to unemployment is that unemployment may be an inappropriate summary measure of wage pressure, because it takes inadequate account of the heterogeneity of the labour market.

Inflation Report:  August 1999 30 example, the short-term unemployed may place more downward pressure on wages than the longer-term unemployed, to the extent that they have more of the  up-to-date skills and experience currently valued by employers.  While aggregate unemployment has been flat or falling compared with a year ago, the number of those in short-term unemployment (of a year or less) has risen a little, according to the LFS.  Pay pressures may also be influenced by those who say they want a job but are not currently available for work, and other groups classed as ‘economically inactive’ rather than unemployed, who collectively account for more than three quarters of non-employment among people of working age. Table 3.C illustrates how the likelihood of becoming employed varied for different groups of the unemployed and inactive in spring 1995.  For example, the first row shows that 35% of those who had been unemployed for less than six months at the start of the period were in employment three months later.  Overall, the unemployed were much more likely to become employed than the inactive.  But the shorter-term unemployed were much more likely to find a job than the long-term unemployed.  And all of those classed as inactive had some positive chance of entering work, with one group in particular—those actively searching but not currently available for work, including students—being more likely to find a job than those who had been unemployed for more than twelve months.  These probability rates vary over the cycle, and could also be affected by policy changes such as the Working Families Tax Credit, which comes into effect in October and is designed to increase the number of people willing to move into work from inactivity by increasing the incentive to work.  But the relative transition rates between the groups may be somewhat more stable over time.  An alternative measure of unemployment, which weights together the number of people in each group using the probabilities shown in the table relative to the probability that someone unemployed for six months or less will find a job, is shown in Chart 3.13.  The measure has not fallen quite as far relative to the previous trough as unemployment.  But the difference is small.  On this measure too, labour market conditions appear to be tight by recent historical standards. 3.3 Summary Nominal earnings growth has eased.

Overtime payments are lower than a year ago, and bonuses appear to have fallen.  In the light of this, the MPC has lowered the short-term profile for nominal earnings growth in the central projection.   While nominal earnings growth has eased, unemployment has remained close to 20-year lows, and the outlook for employment has improved somewhat since May.  As demand growth picks up, a central question for the inflation outlook is the extent to which the available capacity in the labour market will allow growth in employment and hours worked to rise, before triggering renewed inflationary pressures on pay.  It is possible that the relative weakness of real earnings growth, given the low levels of unemployment, indicates somewhat greater labour market capacity than previously thought, perhaps reflecting the impact of government reforms and structural changes over the past 20 years. But there is very considerable uncertainty about the potential size of any such effect.  The Committee’s judgments on the medium-term outlook for earnings are discussed in more detail in Section 6 of this Report.  32 4 Costs and prices Chart 4.1 Brent crude oil prices 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 1995 96 97 98 99 US dollars per barrel One-month future 0 contract Chart 4.2 Implied distribution for oil prices(a)(b) 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 1995 96 97 98 99 2000 0 Expectations as at c.o.b 5 May 1999 Per cent Sources:  NYMEX and Bank of England.

RPIX inflation fell below target in Q2, primarily reflecting movements in import prices and earnings growth.  The prices of oil and a number of other commodities have risen since the May Report, although many remain below their levels a year ago.  Import prices remain subdued, though their annual rate of decline has slowed.  Similarly, UK manufacturing producer prices have fallen less sharply since the end of 1998.  But survey indicators suggest that the rise in costs and prices in the service sector has moderated. 4.1 Raw materials and commodity prices Oil prices rose further in the past three months, and are well above the low recorded in December 1998.  Prices for Brent crude oil rose to more than $19 in July, from around $16 at the time of the May Report (see  Chart 4.1).  This increase reflected higher prospective world demand growth, recent estimated declines in oil stocks, and changing market perceptions of likely future oil supply.  The latter have been affected by reports of greater compliance by OPEC members with the organisation’s production quotas. Probability distributions of expected oil prices derived from options prices are shown in Chart 4.2.  They show that, despite recent sharp oil price movements, the degree of uncertainty about the level of future oil prices has remained broadly unchanged since the May Report. In line with market views, the MPC has assumed that some of the rise in oil prices which occurred in July will persist.  But part of the recent increase is attributed to short-term factors that are expected to reverse quickly. World prices for non-oil commodities in 1999 Q1 were well below their levels a year earlier.  Prices of many of these commodities had begun to rise by the spring, though the increase in prices was generally smaller than for crude oil.  Price rises were also more marked for hard commodities, such as metals, than for soft commodities, such as agricultural products.  But the rise in prices was sufficient for the Bank’s non-oil commodity price index to have recorded positive annual inflation rates in  1999 Q2 for the first time since mid 1996 (see  Chart 4.3).   10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 8 Expectations as at c.o.b 4 August 1999 Per cent 0 1995 96 97 98 99 2000  Costs and prices 33 Chart 4.3 Bank sterling commodity price indices(a) 20 15 10 5 0 5 10 15 Percentage changes on a year earlier + _ Including oil Excluding oil 1995 96 97 98 99 Source:  Bank of England. (a) Monthly average of prices of primary commodities, weighted by their importance in UK demand. The Economist index of sterling non-oil commodity prices was rather weaker than the Bank’s index in the second quarter.  The Economist index was 1.1% higher in the three months to June than in the previous three months, but 10.3% below its level in the same period a year earlier.  The difference between the two indices partly reflects differences in coverage.  The two indices also have different weights, with those in the Bank’s index reflecting UK demand patterns while the Economist index is weighted by OECD imports.  This particularly affects the treatment of food in the two indices.  Wholesale food prices have a higher weight in the Bank’s index than in the Economist index, and the Bank’s measure of food prices has experienced less marked deflation than the Economist measure of world food prices (see Chart 4.4).  Furthermore, the Bank’s measure is derived from Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) agricultural prices, which reflect the effects of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in moderating the extent to which changes in world food prices affect UK wholesale prices. The World Bank and the Economist Intelligence Unit project lower average non-oil dollar commodity prices in 1999 than in 1998.  But the rise in prices in recent months, particularly for hard commodities, is consistent with their projections of an increase in prices in the second half of 1999 and through 2000, as global demand strengthens and stock overhangs are eroded.  The MPC’s central projection is broadly in line with these views. 4.2 Import prices and the exchange rate Sterling import prices were 0.7% lower in 1999 Q1 than in 1998 Q4, and 4.1% lower than in the first quarter of 1998.  This continued fall reflected a further marked decline in imported goods prices in Q1, which were 5.6% below their levels a year earlier.  Imported services prices were 1.5% higher on the same comparison.  But the annual rate of decline in overall import prices has moderated since 1998 Q3, and monthly data on international trade suggest that goods import prices may have stabilised in 1999 Q2.  Sterling import prices for goods and services fell by 14% between 1996 Q3 and 1999 Q1.  The extent of the fall in sterling import prices was less than might have been expected given the marked sterling exchange rate appreciation over this period (see Chart 4.5), particularly since world export prices fell in local currency terms in 1997 and 1998.

That might have reflected overseas producers’ uncertainty about the persistence of the higher sterling exchange rate.   Some further pass-through of the effects of past exchange rate appreciation may therefore act to dampen sterling prices for UK imports.  But the MPC’s central projection assumes that any such lagged exchange rate effects are more than offset by factors such as projected rises in commodity prices and world export prices, as global demand recovers.  Hence sterling import prices are projected to begin rising in the coming quarters. 4.3 Costs and prices in manufacturing Prices of inputs to manufacturing industry remain below their levels a year earlier (see Chart 4.6).  However, the annual rate of decline in input prices slowed to 1.7% in 1999 Q2, from 5.5% in 1999 Q1 and an average decline of 9.1% in 1998.  That partly reflects the recent rise in oil prices, which directly account for around one tenth of the index.  These data were consistent with survey measures such as the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) index of prices paid by manufacturers.  This index rose in Q2, though it remained at a level which suggested that input prices continued to decline.  Reports from the Bank’s regional Agents also suggest that the downward pressure on manufacturers’ input prices may be moderating. Manufacturing output prices rose markedly in March and April, mainly reflecting the effect of higher duties introduced in the 1999 Budget.  Excluding these duties, output prices rose slightly in the three months to June, and were a little below their level a year earlier (see Chart 4.6).  Excluding volatile components such as food, drink, tobacco and petrol, output prices were broadly unchanged in the first half of 1999.  By contrast, the CBI quarterly Industrial Trends survey suggested steeper declines in output prices in July compared with April.    Manufacturers’ weighted costs in recent months have risen above their levels a year earlier, though they fell back somewhat in May (see Table 4.A).  The implications of this rise for future output prices will depend on the behaviour of manufacturers’ price   Costs and prices 35 Chart 4.7 CIPS services survey 44 46 48 50 52 54 56 58 60 62 July Nov.

Research at the Bank has shown that mark-ups tend to move procyclically with economic activity in the United Kingdom, but the full effects of any change in activity are only felt with a lag.(1) Hence the effect of the past slowdown in economic growth may limit the degree to which cost increases are reflected in higher manufacturing prices in the coming months.  Reports from the Bank’s regional Agents suggest that international competition is also limiting manufacturers’ ability to increase their price mark-ups over costs. 4.4 Costs and prices in the service sector The CIPS indices of input prices and prices charged in the service sector both remained above the neutral level of 50 in the three months to July, signifying a net balance of respondents reporting price increases.  But the levels of the CIPS indices suggested that the strength of inflation in service sector costs and prices eased in recent months (see Chart 4.7).  The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) quarterly economic survey also reported muted inflationary pressure.  The balance of service sector firms reporting likely price increases in the coming three months fell markedly in Q2.  The lower balance reflected declines in the number of firms expecting upward pressure on prices from pay settlements, raw materials costs or financial costs. The ONS corporate services price indices, which remain under development, pointed to lower inflation in 1999 Q1 in some services.  The indices are similar in concept to the components of the ONS manufacturing output prices index.  Of the twelve sub-series that are currently published, seven categories of business services  recorded lower inflation in 1999 Q1 than in 1998 Q4, one showed no change and four suggested higher inflation. 4.5 Retail prices Inflation in retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments (RPIX) fell to 2.1% in May, though it rose to 2.2% in June.  RPIX inflation in 1999 Q2 as a whole was 0.2 percentage points below the government’s target of 21/2%, and below expectations at the time of the May Report.  Services price inflation remained at 3.3% throughout Q2, just below the average for Q1.  Hence most of the decline in RPIX inflation has been (1) Small, I (1998), ‘The cyclicality of mark-ups and profit margins’, Quarterly Bulletin, August, pages 267–73.

Annual growth in other key retail price indices also slowed in Q2 (see Chart 4.8).  Inflation in RPIY, which also excludes indirect and local authorities’ taxes, fell to 1.6% in Q2.  The headline  RPI inflation rate fell to 1.4% in Q2, reflecting lower interest rates and hence lower mortgage interest payments. The decline in the rate of goods price inflation partly reflected temporary factors.  One was the direct effect of changes in duties on RPIX (see Table 4.B).  The May Report noted that higher indirect tax rates following the 1999 Budget had increased RPIX inflation to 2.7% in March.  As expected, most of the rise was reversed in Q2, owing largely to the 1998 increase in road fuel taxes dropping out of the calculation of the annual inflation rate.  Other fiscal measures from 1998 will drop out later this year, and these are expected to make a further negative contribution to RPIX inflation in  December 1999 and January 2000. Recent declines in import prices were also important in dampening inflation in 1999 Q2.  Certain non-food components of the RPIX correspond closely to the most import-intensive sectors of the UK economy.  Changes in these RPIX components can account for much of the fall in RPIX inflation between March and May that was not explained by changes in duties.  Chart 4.9 shows the influence of price declines in these sectors on RPIX goods price inflation since mid 1998.  But prices in import-intensive sectors, as in other sectors, will have been affected in Q2 by the cost of domestic inputs as well as imported inputs.  In particular, cost pressures may have been reduced by slower growth in earnings. Import prices are expected to contribute positively to RPIX inflation by the end of the forecast period, consistent with the MPC’s assumption that sterling import prices will begin to rise in the coming quarters. The associated exchange rate assumption, as well as the prospects for earnings growth, is discussed in Section 6 of this Report.   The volatility of retail services price inflation has tended to be lower than that of goods price inflation, and has fallen since 1997 to its lowest level on record (see  Chart 4.10).  One explanation for this is that the service sector is less import-intensive than the goods sector.  It is therefore less affected by international shocks such as fluctuations in the exchange rate and movements in overseas producer prices, so that services prices may Chart 4.8 Retail price inflation(a) 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 1995 96 97 98 99 Percentage changes on a year earlier RPI RPIX RPIY RPIX = Retail price index excluding mortgage interest payments.

However, services prices do have some import content and goods prices are also influenced by domestic pressures.  So other measures of domestically generated inflation (DGI) are constructed in an attempt to strip out international influences on UK goods and services prices.  These measures continue to give mixed signals about the direction of domestic inflationary pressure (see  Chart 4.11). 4.6 Other price indices The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), which is directly comparable with the harmonised inflation measures of other EU Member States, differs from RPIX in its coverage and method of construction.(1) HICP inflation stood at 1.4% in June, compared with 0.9% in the euro area.  The gap between UK and  euro-area inflation has widened in recent months, but it remains narrower than in the second half of 1998 (see Chart 4.12).    Annual growth in the GDP deflator at market prices, a quarterly measure of whole-economy inflation, fell to 1.8% in 1999 Q1, from 1.9% in 1998 Q4.  An alternative, monthly measure of whole-economy inflation has been developed on an experimental basis by the ONS, called the ‘Final Expenditure Price Index’ (FEPI).  Whole-economy inflation as measured by the FEPI was close to 2.0% in the past three quarters.  One way in which the FEPI differs from the GDP deflator is in its coverage of the external sector, since it is a deflator for final domestic expenditure rather than gross domestic product.  The FEPI thus excludes export prices but implicitly includes import prices, whereas the GDP deflator includes export prices and excludes import prices.  Correspondingly, any difference in inflation as measured by the two indices may be affected by movements in the terms of trade, ie the ratio of export prices to import prices.  Annual growth in the terms of trade has been positive since 1996 Q3, when sterling began to appreciate.  Hence annual growth in the FEPI in each quarter has tended to be lower than inflation as measured by the GDP deflator, though other compositional differences between the two indices  meant that in 1999 Q1 the reverse was true (see  Chart 4.13).

Inflation Report:  August 1999 38 4.7 Summary RPIX inflation fell below target in 1999 Q2, and was lower than projected in the May Report.  Import prices and earnings growth were both lower than expected. Retail services price inflation was stable in Q2, and survey measures suggest that producer price inflation in the service sector eased.  But there were signs that the rate of decline in manufacturing producer prices moderated in Q2, and that import prices may have stopped falling in recent months.  After declining further than expected in the early part of the year, prices for non-oil commodities have stabilised in recent months, according to the Bank’s commodity price index.  Non-oil commodity prices are expected to rise in the second half of 1999 and beyond, as global demand strengthens. Some of the recent sharp increases in oil prices may not be sustained, but the MPC now assumes that a higher oil price will prevail over the next two years than was assumed in the May Report.  Hence although RPIX inflation is projected to remain below target in the short term, some external factors that have been exerting downward pressure on inflation may soon cease to do so.

The minutes of the May, June and July meetings are attached as an Annex to this Report.  The Bank of England’s official dealing rate was reduced from 5.25% to 5% in June, and was maintained at that level in July and August. The MPC’s central projection in the May Report was for GDP growth to pick up to around trend by mid 2000, with the risks broadly balanced around this central case. The central projection was for RPIX inflation to fall slightly below target over the next year or so, before rising to around 2.5% at the two-year forecast horizon. On the assumption that the exchange rate was likely to fall by more than implied by interest rate differentials, the balance of risks to inflation was judged to be on the upside.  But some Committee members saw greater downside risks to inflation from a stronger exchange rate profile, weaker world activity and prices, and greater pressure on margins, than in the central projection.  The Report noted that, if sterling did not fall as assumed in the central projection, then, depending on other developments in the economy, further easing of monetary policy might be required to prevent undershooting of the inflation target.  At its meeting on 9–10 June, the Committee noted that sterling had been volatile over the month, but had on average remained at broadly the same value as at the time of the May Committee meeting, and somewhat above the level implied in the central assumption of the May Report.  The Committee discussed the possible reasons for sterling’s movements against the major currencies. The Committee agreed that the latest data on demand and output had been broadly consistent with the May central projection, but household consumption in Q1 had been a little stronger, and net trade a little weaker, than anticipated.  House price inflation had picked up and surveys of consumer and business confidence had continued to improve, although contacts of the Bank’s regional Agents reported a more fragile recovery in sentiment.  The National Accounts measure of  Inflation Report:  August 1999 40 companies’ operating profits had fallen sharply in Q1, but much of this appeared to reflect a statistical adjustment and was therefore more than usually uncertain. The Committee discussed developments in costs and prices.  RPIX inflation appeared to be running below expectations.  World commodity prices had picked up somewhat, but indicators of wage pressures remained mixed.  Earnings growth in the year to March, as measured by the Average Earnings Index, had been in line with the May Report.  Private sector settlements had fallen in April, but public sector settlements had risen, reflecting the implementation of the pay review body awards.   The Committee considered the arguments for a reduction in the repo rate.  Sterling had been stronger than the path incorporated in the May Report.  If this persisted, inflation would be more likely to fall below target than had been projected in May.  Private sector wage settlements had continued to fall, and RPIX inflation had been slightly weaker than projected.  Surveys of households and businesses, and evidence from the Bank’s regional Agents, suggested that the recovery in confidence was not yet robust.  On another view, however, there was no convincing case for a cut in the repo rate.  The value of sterling on the day of the meeting was not very different from that assumed in the May central projection.  News on developments in the domestic and world economies was broadly neutral or slightly positive.  And the fall in RPIX inflation had little implication for the projection two years out.  After weighing these arguments, the Committee voted to reduce the repo rate by 25 basis points to 5%. At its meeting on 7–8 July, the Committee noted that sterling had fallen a little over the month, and the effective exchange rate index was now close to the central assumption in the May Report.  Prospects for growth in the world economy had strengthened a little. Forward-looking activity indicators in some euro-area countries had picked up, and US growth had remained robust, although arguably the uncertainties over the future path of the US economy had increased.  World commodity prices had continued to rise. The Committee agreed that the news on domestic activity over the previous month suggested that the projected recovery seemed to be under way, and was, if anything, a little faster than expected.  Final domestic  Monetary policy since the May Report 41 demand in Q1 had been revised up;  consumption growth in particular now looked rather higher than had been expected, even after adjusting for special factors. Employment had continued to grow, and the possibility of a substantial rise in unemployment appeared to have diminished.  Estimates based on surveys and other published data suggested that GDP growth in Q2 could be marginally higher than envisaged in the May central projection.  The Committee noted that, though activity appeared to have strengthened a little, recent data on prices and wages had been somewhat weaker than anticipated in the May Report.  RPIX inflation had fallen, and nominal private sector pay growth appeared to be slowing. Possible reasons for this weakness were discussed. The Committee considered its immediate policy decision.  The exchange rate had eased slightly, and the outlook for domestic and international activity had improved somewhat since the previous meeting.  But price indicators had been weaker than expected.  A key question for policy was whether these movements would prove to be temporary or persistent.  This would need to be considered more thoroughly as part of the August Inflation Report round, when more data would also be available to help assess the likely direction of future price pressures.  In the light of these considerations, the Committee voted to maintain the repo rate at 5%. At its meeting on 4–5 August, the Committee voted to leave the repo rate unchanged at 5%.  42 6 Prospects for inflation 6.1 The inflation projection assumptions The Committee approved this Report on 6 August.  It contains the Committee’s assessment of developments in the economy since May, and prospects for the medium term.  Charts 6.1 and 6.2 below show projections for GDP growth and RPIX inflation up to two years ahead, and the uncertainties surrounding them.(1) The projections assume that the Bank’s repo interest rate will remain unchanged at 5% during the next two years, and are conditioned on the assumptions described below. There has been a further moderate improvement in the prospects for world activity since the May Report. Growth in the United States has remained robust and the outlook for activity appears stronger than three months ago.  Output growth is expected to ease gradually, although the timing and extent of the slowdown remains difficult to gauge.  Business sentiment in the euro area has improved over the past three months, and there are more signs of a prospective recovery in growth.  And, while much of the unexpected growth in GDP in Japan in 1999 Q1 probably reflected temporary factors, the outlook nonetheless appears a little brighter.  Outside the major industrial countries, prospects for many emerging Asian and Latin American economies have improved over the past three months.  Taking these developments together, the MPC has made a further small upward revision to the central projection for global activity. Growth in UK-weighted export markets is now assumed to rise from almost 5% in 1999 to near 6% in 2000.  But, as in recent projections, UK exports are likely to grow less quickly than export markets in the short term, as the effects of the past appreciation of sterling continue to filter through. There are a number of risks to the world outlook.  For example, the US economy could slow more rapidly than projected, should asset prices fall and domestic demand growth falter.  Trade imbalances among the major economies have widened further.  Fragilities remain in some emerging markets.  Interest rate spreads on emerging market debt over US Treasuries have edged up (1) A box assessing the MPC’s inflation forecasting record is appended on page 55.  Prospects for inflation 43 since the May Report.  So, although the Committee has raised the central projection for world activity, risks around this projection are judged to be weighted to the downside. Although world activity in the early months of the year was stronger than expected in the May Report, inflationary pressures were somewhat weaker.  Non-oil commodity prices were lower in the first quarter than assumed three months ago.  Moreover, the price of manufactured export goods continued to fall,  against earlier expectations of a slight rise.   Lower-than-expected world inflation was reflected in UK import prices falling by more than projected in  May. The period of falling world prices may, however, be coming to an end.  The prices of some important non-oil commodities have risen in recent months—and commodity-related equities and currencies are signalling upward pressure on prices.  Drawing on information from external forecasts, the central projection is based  on an assumption that non-oil commodity prices gradually recover from their low point in the first half of 1999.  Oil prices have been stronger than expected in the May Report, as market conditions have tightened.  The central assumption for the oil price has consequently been increased by $2 per barrel to around $17 per barrel for Brent crude, although the Committee also noted that the Brent price has risen above $19 per barrel in recent weeks and that there was a risk that this higher level could be sustained.  As world activity strengthens and higher commodity prices gradually feed through, prices of traded goods and services may start to edge up.  The rise in world prices from now on may be a little stronger than assumed in the May projection, given the improved outlook for activity.  But any pick-up is likely to remain modest, given excess capacity in the production of some key manufactured goods and commodities at the global level.  The rise will, moreover, be from a lower  starting-level.  The outlook for UK import prices will be affected by the changing profile for world prices as well as by the prospects for the sterling exchange rate. The sterling exchange rate, as measured by the effective exchange rate index (ERI), averaged 103.1 in the  15 working days up to and including 4 August.  This forms the starting-point for the exchange rate profile assumed in the projection.  It compares with a  starting-point of 104.0 at the time of the May Report and is slightly below the implied level of 103.4 for August.  Inflation Report:  August 1999 44 As in previous Reports, assumptions about the path of sterling in the central projection are linked to the pattern of market interest rate differentials—in turn adjusted for the conventional forecast assumption that UK interest rates are held constant.  On this basis, the sterling ERI declines to 96.6 by the end of the two-year forecast period, consistent with bilateral sterling exchange rates of about $1.56 and 0.71 against the euro (equivalent to DM 2.75).  That is a steeper decline than in May.  Risks around this central projection are assumed to be symmetric.    There are, however, differences of view within the Committee on the appropriate conditioning assumption for the exchange rate path.  Some Committee members preferred an alternative approach, consistent with the random walk hypothesis, of assuming a constant nominal exchange rate at the current level as the basis for the central projection.  On this alternative assumption for the exchange rate, RPIX inflation would be  0.4 percentage points lower than in the central case at the two-year horizon and four-quarter GDP growth would be some 0.2 percentage points lower. The fiscal plans announced by the Chancellor in the March Budget were incorporated into the May projections.  These figures remain the basis for the August projections. Previous projections have already incorporated assumptions about the effects of the National Minimum Wage, the New Deal and the Working Time Directive. Recent outturns for earnings growth have been  lower than projected, which may indicate a  smaller-than-expected impact from the National Minimum Wage.  More evidence is needed.  The Committee has, however, removed the upside risk of a larger effect than in the central projection.  There is no change to the other assumptions about the effects of labour market reforms. 6.2 The medium-term inflation projection Output growth has resumed in recent months. According to the preliminary GDP release in late July, output rose by 0.5% in the second quarter, after two quarters in which the level of economic activity was broadly flat.  The recent pick-up was a little faster than projected in May, suggesting that the recovery in activity may be gaining momentum more quickly than judged three months ago.  The level of activity has also been revised up since the spring of last year.  However, the  Prospects for inflation 45 implications for the medium-term inflation outlook are uncertain.  For, although growth may be strengthening a little more rapidly than earlier projected, and from a higher base, short-run inflationary pressures have been weaker than expected three months ago.  The Committee has revised its projections for activity and inflation against this background.   Detailed information on the composition of expenditure and output is only available up to the first quarter of this year.  Preliminary estimates were published by the ONS in May and June, but full data only became available in late July with the National Accounts Blue Book release. As well as completing the picture for the first quarter, this release incorporated revisions to the level and composition of activity for the past two years.  The cumulative effect of revisions up to 1999 Q1 raised the level of GDP at constant market prices by 0.4%, with most of the revisions to the level of GDP and its components occurring in 1998.  Domestic demand proved stronger than previously estimated, with upward revisions to consumer spending and fixed investment, partly counterbalanced by a downward revision to the volume of government consumption.  The upward revisions to GDP are of the same order of magnitude as the cumulative downward adjustments made in February and March.  The Committee revisited its earlier discussion on the possible implications for future inflation of the revisions to output.  Echoing that discussion, the Committee concluded that the data revisions were not sufficiently large to warrant a material change to the inflation outlook. The National Accounts release confirmed that overall GDP was essentially flat around the turn of the year, in line with the May projection.  The composition of demand was rather different, however.  Final domestic demand rose by 1.1% in the first quarter, much more strongly than projected, as consumer spending increased sharply.  Stronger-than-expected final domestic demand was not reflected in higher overall activity, however, as firms took the opportunity to correct stock levels more rapidly than earlier judged, and as net trade weakened by more than projected.  But the combination of stronger final domestic demand and a reduction of the inventory overhang is consistent with a faster pick-up in activity in the second quarter and thereafter. The interest rate cuts since October have affected consumer sentiment and behaviour in recent months. Even so, consumer spending has strengthened more  Inflation Report:  August 1999 46 rapidly than expected three months ago.  Spending rose sharply in the first quarter from a higher-than-expected level at the end of 1998.  Although the rapid growth in the first quarter partly reflected a change in the seasonal pattern of purchases of new cars, the underlying picture was of much higher expenditure than projected in the May Report.  More timely indicators are consistent with a stronger outturn for consumer spending in recent months as well.  Retail sales volumes rose by almost 1% in the second quarter.  Consumer confidence indicators have improved further, although the GfK indicator dropped back to April levels in July.  Narrow money is rising quickly.  Personal lending growth has picked up further and mortgage approvals continue to rise sharply. The housing market is clearly strengthening, providing a further signal of improving consumer sentiment. The MPC re-examined the prospects for consumer spending given these developments.  Previous Reports had noted that the initial estimates of consumer spending last year had turned out weaker than expected, given the pattern of other variables such as labour income, wealth, interest rates and unemployment.  In previous projections, part of the unexplained weakness had been assumed to persist into the future.  But the recent evidence suggested that this adjustment was not warranted:  the upward revision to consumer spending in 1998, together with the strength of expenditure in early 1999, had brought consumption growth into line with the rates expected on the basis of average historical experience.  The Committee consequently removed the earlier adjustment, raising the projected profile for consumer spending.  The Committee also decided to revise upwards the central projection for house price inflation:  house prices are now assumed to rise at around double the pace of earnings over the next two years.  Faster growth in housing wealth is likely to provide a further moderate boost to the consumer spending outlook.  The Committee judged that the risks to the consumption profile were on the upside over the next twelve to eighteen months. Inventory investment in both the final quarter of 1998 and the first quarter of 1999 was weaker than projected in May, as firms took advantage of robust final demand to correct excess stock levels.  Recent surveys have suggested that there may have been further adjustment in the second quarter, but that stock levels are now more closely aligned with desired levels than they were a year ago.  Against the background of improved cyclical balance, the Committee reviewed its assumption on the  Prospects for inflation 47 secular trend in the stock-output ratio.  As in previous projections, the Committee judged that further reductions in the ratio were likely, as firms continue to invest in improved stock management techniques, but, drawing on disaggregated analysis and international evidence, the MPC decided to assume a slower pace of decline than before. Business investment continued to rise quickly, underpinned by very strong growth in service sector investment.  Whole-economy investment growth in the first quarter was weaker than projected, however, as public investment fell sharply.  The timing of public investment is rather erratic, and the underspend at the end of the previous financial year is assumed to be spent in the current financial year.  Overall, there has been little change to the outlook for investment. Net trade continued to depress overall GDP growth in Q1, as import growth remained strong, while export volumes fell.  Rapid growth in domestic demand and the strength of sterling have continued to boost imports.  But export growth stalled as global demand growth slowed last year and as UK firms lost share in foreign markets. Although net exports were a little weaker than expected in the first quarter, prospects for the next two years have improved a little.  Stronger world trade growth and a slightly softer exchange rate profile are the main reasons. The changes overall are relatively small, however, and the central projection remains that net exports will on average detract from GDP growth in both 1999 and 2000, but at a declining rate. Overall, the Committee considers that the outlook for economic activity has strengthened since May.  Faster growth in consumer spending and a slower pace of inventory adjustment should boost domestic demand. And the improvement in the outlook for the international economy has raised prospective export growth. Data revisions have raised recent estimates of the  four-quarter growth rate of GDP.  The central projection is for the four-quarter growth rate of GDP at constant market prices to continue to rise as domestic demand growth strengthens, and it may return to assumed trend rates by the end of this year, rather earlier than in the May projection (see Chart 6.1).(1) The four-quarter growth rate continues to rise thereafter before levelling off at around 3%, as world trade growth is assumed to flatten.

Inflation Report:  August 1999 48 Survey evidence from business and households is consistent with the picture of rising growth in the central projection.  Agents’ contacts also report gradually improving sentiment, although to a lesser extent than some of the surveys.  The Agents also report that clear differences remain between sectors and regions, with stronger performance in the service sector and in the south of England. Recent data for the labour market are also consistent with an improvement in business confidence.  Labour demand has been rather stronger than earlier projected. Employment on the LFS measure has continued to rise, and unemployment on both the LFS and claimant count estimates has edged down further.  There now seems little likelihood of a substantial fall in overall employment in the coming months. Although the recovery in activity appears more firmly entrenched than three months ago, news on nominal outturns since May suggests that recent inflationary pressures were again weaker than earlier judged.  Import prices were lower than projected.  Nominal earnings growth also slowed against expectations.  Moreover, RPIX inflation in the second quarter was 0.2 percentage points below the central projection in the May Report. Forward-looking nominal indicators provide mixed signals.  Official interest rates are lower than in May, although money-market rates over the short-to-medium term have risen substantially.  Narrow money has accelerated.  Moreover, while broad money growth has slowed, the recent trend has been largely accounted for by movements in financial company deposits, which may have little immediate implication for nominal demand.  Divisia money growth is flat.  And credit growth has picked up further, particularly to households. After declining sharply over the past twelve months, surveys of inflation expectations over the next two years are little changed since the May Report. Pay pressures have weakened in recent months in nominal terms.  Earnings growth in the private sector has slowed sharply according to the Average Earnings Index and the Reward Index.  Private sector settlements are typically running well below levels of a year earlier. Although public sector settlements and earnings growth have increased following the implementation of the pay review body recommendations, private sector influences dominate at the whole-economy level.  Headline average earnings growth slowed to 4.3% in May, some  0.5 percentage points lower than in March.  Prospects for inflation 49 Lower price inflation provides part of the explanation for slower growth in nominal earnings.  Inflation expectations have fallen sharply over the past year.  For example, the Barclays Basix survey of inflation expectations for the next twelve months held by trade unions has fallen by 0.8 percentage points over the past year.  RPIX inflation has slipped below the target.  And inflation on the headline RPI measure has dropped to 1.3% in June, a fall of more than 2 percentage points over the past twelve months, as lower interest rates have reduced mortgage interest payments.  The gap between RPI and RPIX inflation will begin to close unless there are further reductions in interest rates, but the sharp fall in RPI inflation may have had a temporary effect on wage settlements, over and above the effects of lower inflation expectations and RPIX inflation outturns on settlements. Real earnings growth has continued to rise on a number of measures.  Nonetheless, real earnings growth has been rather weaker than expected three months ago, at a time when the labour market has been rather stronger than projected. The Committee reviewed the evidence for a change in the relationship between real earnings growth and the degree of tightness in the labour market.  Reforms to the labour market over a number of years, such as the tightening of eligibility to claim benefits and the reduction in the power and membership of trade unions, may have lowered the rate of unemployment at which inflationary pressures start to increase.  Although the evidence was hard to read and subject to significant uncertainty, the Committee decided that the recent earnings data were consistent with some improvement in the structure of the labour market.  An adjustment to the central projection was made to reflect this, lowering the outlook for real earnings growth for a given level of unemployment.  The revision of this assumption has contributed to lower nominal earnings growth in the near term than in the May projection, but the stronger outlook for activity and for import prices push in the opposite direction, and are more dominant by the end of the  two-year period.  Risks around the new central projection for earnings were judged by the Committee to be on the upside.   All members agreed that there was considerable uncertainty surrounding the prospects for earnings, and that it was particularly difficult to form quantified judgments on the potential implications of the improved  Inflation Report:  August 1999 50 functioning of the labour market for the inflationary outlook.  Some Committee members preferred a smaller adjustment than in the central projection and thought that real earnings growth could be stronger;  other Committee members preferred a larger adjustment and a weaker earnings profile.  Depending on the alternative view taken, RPIX inflation could be around  0.2 percentage points higher or lower at the two-year horizon. Productivity growth tempers the impact of earnings on firms’ unit costs.  The preliminary estimate for GDP growth and partial LFS data suggest that  whole-economy productivity may have risen in the second quarter, the first sign of a reversal of the pattern of weakening productivity growth over recent quarters as activity growth slowed.  A turnaround in productivity was expected as the cyclical recovery in activity gathered pace.  The Committee has maintained the assumptions from the May forecast that productivity growth per hour will return to its long-run historical average over the next two years, and that structural changes in labour market performance have reduced the variability of productivity over the cycle.  Productivity per person will pick up more rapidly than productivity per hour, as average working time lengthens in the cyclical recovery. RPIX inflation fell to 2.3% in the second quarter, around 0.2 percentage points lower than projected in the May Report.  Goods prices have been particularly weak.  The overprediction can be largely accounted for by weaker import prices and lower-than-expected earnings growth and labour costs.  Preliminary estimates of price-cost margins appear to be broadly in line with expectations, and so no fundamental change was made to the assumptions incorporated in the previous projections.  A small downward adjustment was, however, made to the level of margins from 2000 Q2 onwards, to take account of the possibility of a more concentrated compression of margins in the water industry following the recent recommendations from OFWAT.  This adjustment has no effect on measured RPIX inflation by the end of the  two-year period.  Risks to the central projection for price-cost margins were viewed as symmetric.  Some Committee members considered that an intensification of competitive pressure, driven partly by regulatory developments and linked also to factors such as the impact of information technology on distribution channels, could lead to a structural reduction in the level of margins in some sectors.  In their opinion, this  Prospects for inflation 51 reduction could lower measured inflation as the adjustment took place by perhaps some 0.2 percentage points at the two-year horizon. The Committee’s best collective projection for the twelve-month RPIX inflation rate—based on the assumption that nominal interest rates are held constant at 5%—is shown in Chart 6.2.(1) Alongside is the projection from the May Report, which was based on constant interest rates at 5.25%. The broad shape of the current profile is similar to May. But there are a number of important differences.  The starting-point is lower than in May, as inflation has fallen more rapidly than expected.  Inflation is likely to remain below target for much of the forecast period. The trough in inflation may also be deeper as lower earnings growth reduces unit costs in the near term.  But over the medium term this is offset by a combination of upward pressures from stronger domestic and world activity, higher oil prices, rising world inflation, lower official interest rates and a weaker exchange rate.  In the central projection, inflation picks up to just above the target level by 2001 Q3. Risks around the central projection for activity growth are slightly on the upside in the first year, reflecting the possibility of faster consumer spending growth, but are weighted to the downside in the second year, reflecting the possibility of a weaker outlook for the world (1) Also shown as Chart 2 in the Overview.

The risks to inflation are weighted to the upside, particularly in the first year, reflecting the possibility of stronger consumer spending and of a smaller improvement in structural labour market performance and hence of higher earnings growth.  The downside risks to world activity in the second year provide a partial mitigation.  Charts 6.4 and 6.5 show the overall balance of risks to inflation at the two-year horizon.  Table 6.A presents the MPC’s best collective judgment of the probabilities of various outcomes for inflation and GDP growth.   There are a number of major uncertainties in the outlook, where difficult judgments have been made by the Committee to produce the projections.  On some issues, certain Committee members preferred to take a different view.  These are not incorporated explicitly in the fan charts or in Table 6.A, but are shown in a new Table 6.B. This table illustrates the possible effects on RPIX inflation and GDP growth of the alternative assumptions. These estimates themselves are highly uncertain and they should be viewed as broad calibrations rather than as definitive point estimates. There are four areas where different judgments were preferred by some members.  Some Committee members preferred to base the projection on the conditioning assumption of a constant nominal exchange rate.  That would weaken the outlook for activity and inflation Table 6.A The MPC’s expectations for RPIX inflation and GDP growth based on constant nominal interest rates(a) RPIX inflation Probability, per cent  Range: less  1.5% 2.0%  2.5%  3.0% more than  to  to  to  to  than 1.5% 2.0% 2.5% 3.0% 3.5% 3.5% 1999 Q4 <1 11 60 28 1 <1 2000 Q4 19 29 28 16 6 2 2001 Q3 7 14 22 24 18 15 GDP growth  Probability, per cent  Range: less  0%  1%  2%  3%  more  than  to  to  to  to  than  0% 1% 2% 3% 4% 4% 1999 Q4 <1 8 44 40 8 <1 2000 Q4 <1 4 17 36 30 13 2001 Q3 1 6 18 31 29 15 (a) These figures are from the same distributions as the GDP and inflation fan charts, Charts 6.1 and 6.2.  Prospects for inflation 53 relative to the central case:  RPIX inflation would be some 0.4 percentage points lower than otherwise at the two-year horizon and GDP growth would be around  0.2 percentage points lower.  Views also differed on wage pressures.  Some Committee members considered that pay pressures could be rather stronger than  reflected in the projection in Chart 6.2:  others took the opposite view and judged that earnings could be weaker than in the collective projection.  Depending on the view taken, the inflation profile would either be raised or lowered—by about 0.2 percentage points at the two-year horizon—but with little effect on the activity outlook. Some Committee members judged that there were downside risks to inflation from an intensification of competitive pressures which would reduce the level of profit margins.  Taking this alternative view, inflation could be around 0.2 percentage points lower than in the central projection at the two-year horizon.  Activity would be slightly higher.  Finally, some Committee members noted that the oil price had risen to over  $19 per barrel in recent weeks and preferred to base the projections on a higher oil price.  Basing the projection on a $19 per barrel oil price would increase RPIX inflation by around 0.2 percentage points at the two-year horizon. These assumptions are viewed by the Committee members as a series of separate judgments.  The net effect of the alternative assumptions preferred by different Committee members gave rise to a range of views about inflation prospects, illustrating the particular difficulties in judging the outlook for inflation in present circumstances.  Some Committee members preferred assumptions that would raise the inflation profile shown in Chart 6.2 by about 0.2 percentage points at the  two-year horizon.  Other Committee members preferred assumptions that would lower the profile shown in  Chart 6.2 by 0.2 to 0.6 percentage points after two  years. The market expectation of the likely path of interest rates has changed markedly since the May Report.  At close of business on 4 August, implied interest rates on  short-sterling futures contracts suggested that the market expectation was, on balance, for official interest rates to rise steadily over the next two years, reaching around 7% by 2001 Q3.  So the MPC’s projections under the assumption that official rates move in line with market expectations are for significantly weaker output growth and a much lower profile for inflation than in the constant interest rate case (see Charts 6.6 and 6.7).

Rows may not sum to 100 because of rounding. (b) 25 forecasters. 6.3 Other forecasts Chart 6.8 shows the distribution of central forecasts for the twelve-month rate of RPIX inflation in 2001 Q3, based on information from 25 forecasters surveyed by the Bank in late July.  The mean forecast for the year to 1999 Q4 was 2.1%, rising to 2.4% in 2000 Q4, and reaching 2.6% in 2001 Q3.  The estimate for 1999 is a little lower than the projection made at the time of the April survey, while the estimates for 2000 and 2001 are slightly higher.  The forecasters assign just over 50% probability to inflation being above the target in the third quarter of 2001, and just under 50% probability to it being below (see Table 6.C).  These estimates have changed slightly since the May Report, with further weight being placed on higher outturns for inflation. The forecasters’ average projection for GDP growth in the year to 1999 Q4 is 11/2% (with a range of projections from 1% to 21/2%), rising to 23/4% in the year to 2001 Q3 (with a range of 2% to 31/2%).  The estimate for 1999 Q4 is slightly higher than at the time of the May Report. The implications of the latest projections for the stance of monetary policy are discussed in the Overview at the beginning of this Report.  Prospects for inflation 55 Inflation projections are central to the conduct of monetary policy, because it takes time for interest rate changes to affect inflation;  empirical evidence suggests that their full impact may take up to two years.(1) So how have the MPC’s projections compared with inflation outturns? Two factors must be borne in mind when assessing the MPC’s forecasting record.  First, the MPC’s inflation projection takes the form of a probability distribution, not a point estimate, because of considerable statistical and economic uncertainty.(2) The question, then, is where in the probability distributions were the eventual outcomes?  A way of answering this is to compare the outcomes with the means (ie average outcomes) or modes (ie most likely outcomes) projected by the MPC.  Second, the MPC’s projections are conditioned on assumptions about economic variables such as interest rates and the exchange rate.  The accuracy of these assumptions will affect how the inflation projections compare with the outturns. The August 1997 Inflation Report contained the MPC’s first inflation projection.(3) Data are now available to compare that projection with outturns seven quarters ahead (ie for 1997 Q4 to 1999 Q2).  And the projections made in November 1997, February 1998 and May 1998 can be compared with outturns six, five and four quarters ahead, respectively.(4) The chart shows the paths of the mean RPIX inflation projections from those Reports, together with the actual outcomes.  Inflation has sometimes been higher, and sometimes lower, than the projected mean path.  On average, the outcome four quarters ahead was broadly in line with the projected mean.  However, the outturns were on average 0.2% higher than the projected modes, since the risks around the most likely outcome, or central projection, were generally on the upside. These one year ahead forecast errors are small relative to the errors made in Inflation Report forecasts from 1993 to  May 1997, ie prior to the MPC, with actual inflation turning out close to the centre of the fan charts.  But as yet there are a limited number of observations on which to assess the MPC’s inflation forecasting record, and over the past two years inflation outturns have on average been less variable than in previous years.  Nevertheless, it is important to understand why actual and projected inflation have differed. To what extent are the inflation forecast errors the result of the conditioning assumption of constant interest rates?  This assumption is not very important in explaining forecast errors over the one-year horizon for the four projections at hand, because the profile of actual interest rates has turned out relatively close to the constant interest rate assumption (except during 1999).  Only a small proportion of the overall RPIX inflation forecast errors can be explained by the difference between the constant interest rate assumption and the eventual outturn. What other factors might explain the inflation forecast errors?  The effective exchange rate has consistently turned out higher than the MPC had assumed based on interest rate differentials.  These errors in exchange rate assumptions, together with unexpected weakness in world traded goods prices, led to a systematic overprediction of import prices: the mean forecast error for four-quarter growth in import prices averaged more than 3 percentage points for the forecasts between August 1997 and February 1998. Accurate import prices on their own would not have helped the inflation projection;  indeed, predicted inflation would have been consistently lower than the outturns if future import prices had been predicted more accurately, other things remaining the same. In contrast to import prices, average earnings growth up to the one-year horizon was on average higher than expected over the four projections.  Although the errors are small relative to those on import prices, earnings growth has a larger direct effect on RPIX inflation.  But these two influences have not offset each other in a systematic way, resulting in some positive and some negative forecast errors. The MPC makes projections for GDP growth as well as for RPIX inflation.  There are no systematic errors in the one year ahead mean (and mode) GDP growth projections made by the MPC between August 1997 and May 1998.  However, domestic demand has consistently turned out higher than predicted.  This has been offset by weaker-than-expected net trade, reflecting the unanticipated strength of sterling and adverse external shocks, notably the crisis in Asia. It is too early to draw strong conclusions about the MPC’s inflation forecasting record, given the lags in the transmission of monetary policy, the prevalence of shocks, and the limited number of observations.  But there is no obvious evidence so far of large systematic errors.

The world economy 2 The Committee discussed whether there had been a material change in the world economic outlook, or in the balance of risks, since its February Inflation Report.  Overall, prospects had slightly improved.  In particular, US economic growth had again been strong, and was unaccompanied by manifest signs of rising inflation.  It now seemed likely that growth in 1999 would be higher than previously expected.  The longer the strength of demand persisted, the greater would be the risk of the economy hitting capacity constraints and inflationary pressures emerging. Unemployment was already significantly below the level previously generally thought to be consistent with stable inflation. Productivity growth had also risen above most previous estimates of its trend, despite the length of the current expansion.  The resulting uncertainty about the path of capacity output complicated US monetary policy.  If any eventual tightening therefore came as a surprise, there might be a larger reaction in financial markets, particularly given the continuing strength of the equity market.   The US outlook was a major area of uncertainty in the world economy. 3 Economic prospects in the euro area remained subdued, and were judged to be slightly weaker than in February.  While the  50 basis point reduction in official interest rates should help, business confidence indicators were still weak.  Despite some improvement in sentiment, the economic outlook in Japan continued to be uncertain. 4 Conditions in emerging market economies, taken as a whole, had improved somewhat in recent months.  This was evident in the yields on US$-denominated bonds issued by emerging market economy governments, which were on average down about  three percentage points relative to US Treasury bond yields since February.  The balance of forecasts for growth in Asia was up slightly, and conditions in Brazil seemed more stable than a month ago. 5 The Balkan conflict had already had economic repercussions in some neighbouring countries.  It added to uncertainties more widely, and on one view created a downside risk to world activity and prices, through negative effects on confidence if the situation remained unresolved or the conflict spread.  This was the kind of risk to which the Committee could if necessary react as developments occurred. Monetary and financial conditions 6 The Committee noted that its April reduction in interest rates had not yet been reflected fully in bank and building society rates. However, pass through of official rate changes had not always been immediate in the past, and it seemed unlikely that a greater than usual spread between private sector and official rates could be sustained for long. 7 Annual broad money growth had fallen to around 7%, almost entirely on account of reduced money holdings by the non-bank financial sector.  Assuming a trend fall in velocity of around 2% per year, aggregate monetary growth was broadly consistent with the inflation target and trend output growth. 8 Developments in bank lending to different sectors were quite varied.  In particular, the annual rate of growth in household credit had risen to about 8%, with secured lending up sharply.  Mortgage loan approvals were also strong.  Taken together with other signs of housing market momentum, this would need to be watched. 9 Equity prices had continued to rise, with the FT-SE All-Share Index up by over 10% since February.  The consequent boost to household wealth would tend to support consumption growth in the period ahead.  Private sector investment might also be more buoyant as a result. 10 A significant development in monetary and financial conditions was the further rise in sterling’s effective exchange rate. The ERI was up around 3% since the April meeting, and was around 5% higher than the level implied by February’s central projection.  It seemed that a material part, but not all, of this appreciation could be explained by relative yield curve movements, the sterling yield curve having risen and the euro area yield curve having fallen, reflecting changing market assessments of the outlook for growth and, thus, monetary policy settings.  Other market explanations included a change in the sterling/euro risk premium in sterling’s favour, possibly related in part to the Kosovo conflict, which appeared to be consistent with the slight appreciation in the euro when there had been news of intensified diplomatic efforts;  a possible longer-term rerating of relative UK economic prospects;  and increased merger and acquisition-related demand for sterling, although given the liquidity and depth of the foreign exchange market, it seemed unlikely that such transaction-related factors could have had anything more than a brief effect, whereas sterling’s rise had been sustained over three months. Demand and output 11 GDP growth in Q1 was now estimated to have been 0.1%;  it was probably slightly higher excluding energy industries.  Since the beginning of 1998 there had now been five consecutive quarters of below-trend growth.  That should have done a lot to relieve capacity pressures, although judgments could easily differ about the precise balance of aggregate demand and supply.  The economy was probably at or slightly past the trough in growth, which was set to recover towards trend.   12 On the demand side, consumption growth now seemed to have been stronger in 1998 Q4 than had been thought in February. The evidence available so far suggested this had been maintained into 1999 Q1.  Consumer confidence had risen since February, and housing market indicators were showing signs of renewed strength. 13 The outlook for investment was stronger than a quarter ago, partly reflecting the marked recovery in measures of business confidence and partly the stronger than expected outturns in the second half of 1998.  At this early stage of the new monetary framework, it was difficult to know whether the recovery in confidence was the result of the apparently sharper than expected easing of monetary policy, or whether the available measures of business confidence were simply volatile, and perhaps at times misleading, indicators. 14 There were suggestions from the Bank’s regional Agents that the recovery in confidence was fragile.  It was not possible to substantiate this, but it seemed likely that any recovery in Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 5–6 May 1999  Inflation Report:  August 1999 60 manufacturing sector sentiment would remain weak while sterling’s strength persisted.  And it was possible that household sector confidence would be vulnerable to any significant increase in unemployment. 15 As discussed at the Committee’s previous meeting, the counterpart to the upward revision to domestic demand growth in 1998 Q4 had been a larger trade deficit.  Although this was likely to increase, the current account deficit was likely to be smaller in relation to GDP, partly on account of strong net income on overseas investments. Labour market conditions 16 As had been the case for some time, labour market indicators painted a mixed picture.  On the one hand, nominal settlements were lower, and the Reward index of nominal earnings growth was still slowing.  On the other hand, the Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services had reported a slight increase in pay rates in April;  and according to the revised January Average Earnings Index and the first February estimate, nominal earnings growth had stopped falling.  Nominal earnings growth had in fact fallen by less than most measures of expected inflation, suggesting that expected real earnings growth might have risen.  There were two reasons why wage drift—the gap between nominal earnings growth and settlements—might have increased.  First, firms might be awarding any pay increases needed to comply with the National Minimum Wage rules outside the normal pay round.  Second, there might have been an increase in bonuses, but this was difficult to judge as the ONS’s question about bonuses had recently changed, so that there was a break in the series. 17 The labour market remained tight.  Employment had been increasing even though output growth had been below trend for the past 15 months or so.  Measured by headcount, employment had continued to rise recently, although by less in 1999 Q1 than in  1998 Q4.  Taken at face value, this might suggest that the labour market was still tightening.  However, part of the increase was accounted for by a rise in the number of part-time workers. Overtime hours had fallen.  Overall, hours worked per head had also fallen.  Unemployment had risen slightly, but was still close to a 20 year low.  According to the latest British Chambers of Commerce survey, employment intentions were less positive in services and flat in manufacturing.  Evidence on skill shortages and recruitment difficulties had also suggested some easing, but the picture was not clear. 18 Taking all the evidence together, the Committee judged that nominal earnings growth would be lower in the remainder of 1999 and in 2000 than had been expected in February, partly due to the sustained fall in inflation expectations. Prices 19 Although the Bank’s index of non-oil commodity prices had fallen 3% in the year to March, the twelve-month rate of decline was now much lower than throughout 1998 and into 1999, and the index had risen by 2% during March itself.  Oil prices continued to rise, reflecting supply policy changes.  It had been suggested that some commodity prices had fallen close to marginal production costs, making it unlikely that prices would continue to fall. 20 Manufacturing input prices (excluding food, beverages, tobacco and petrol) had been flat in March, but were still down 41/2% on a year ago.  Manufacturing output prices (excluding food, beverages, tobacco and petrol) were also flat. 21 Overall, it seemed likely that the downward pressure on RPIX inflation of falling world commodity prices would come to an end during the two-year forecast period.  The RPIX inflation rate had spiked up in March due to the timing of the introduction of various Budget measures.  It was expected to fall back in April. The May inflation and growth projections 22 The Committee agreed the projections to be published in the Inflation Report on 12 May. 23 On the assumption of constant official interest rates of 5.25%, the central projection for output growth rose to around the economy’s trend rate of growth by the middle of 2000.  The risks were broadly balanced. 24 The central projection for inflation was broadly in line with the target over the forecast period.  It fell slightly below target for the next year or so, principally on account of sterling’s recent appreciation and the lower assumed path for earnings growth;  and then rose to about 21/2% at the two year horizon, as demand strengthened and the effects of sterling’s appreciation wore off. 25 The central projection assumed that sterling’s effective exchange rate would depreciate in line with uncovered interest rate parity (ie interest rate differentials).  If sterling was likely to fall by more than this, as indicated by most outside forecasts, the balance of risks to inflation was on the upside.  That was the view of a majority of the Committee.  Some members judged, however, that the balance of risks to inflation was on the downside because they thought sterling was likely to be in line with or stronger than the path assumed in the central projection, and also saw downside risks from weaker than assumed world activity and prices, and from greater pressure on margins. Other considerations relevant to the policy decision 26 The Committee discussed a range of other issues relevant to its policy decision. 27 How much weight should the Committee place on the central projection for inflation being slightly below target for the next year or so but roughly at target, and rising, at the two year horizon?  A number of possible arguments were identified.  First, the central projection’s saucer shape was largely attributable to sterling’s recent appreciation, the effects of which would be temporary. Second, the Committee could consider whether there was a path for policy that could underpin activity growth in the relatively short run while not endangering achievement of the inflation target at and beyond the forecast horizon;  this might be achieved by a temporary reduction in interest rates.  Third, it was possible that the new monetary framework had altered expectations and thus the speed of the transmission mechanism, with shorter lags from changes in policy to the effects on output and inflation.  Views varied on these issues. 28 What did the recent strength of sterling imply for policy? Sterling’s renewed appreciation presented a dilemma for policy.  It had exacerbated the imbalances in the economy, given the already considerable pressures on exporters and producers competing domestically with imports.  The implications for inflation, and thus for monetary policy, depended on the reasons for the appreciation. To the extent that it reflected changed perceptions of the outlook for UK monetary policy, policy should respond only if market expectations were materially wrong.  Otherwise, depending on the effect on interest rate expectations, reducing official interest rates now might increase expected inflation.  The Committee had agreed, however, that relative yield curve movements did not explain the whole of sterling’s recent rise, which would therefore tend to put downward pressure on inflation in the near term.  In principle, the forecast process should identify and quantify the various influences on sterling, but this assessment was inevitably imprecise. 29 Given the dilemma for policy created by sterling’s rise, the Committee noted that it could, in principle, use two other instruments.  The first was a statement explaining the part played by sterling in its eventual policy decision.  This option was available whatever the decision on interest rates.  Monetary Policy Committee 61 30 The second was foreign exchange intervention.  A range of views was expressed.  It was possible that combining a reduction in interest rates and a statement with publicly-announced intervention might help to underline the Committee’s concerns about the exchange rate.  The Committee did not believe that intervention could materially affect the balance between demand and supply in the foreign exchange market;  rather it would help to underline the Committee’s view about the implications of sterling’s strength. However, given that sterling currently seemed well supported in the market, it was not possible to be confident that intervention would have the desired effect, and it could possibly have a perverse effect. It was also important not to confuse the market about the role of the exchange rate in the Committee’s analysis and reaction function, which were geared to the inflation target. The immediate policy decision 31 On one view, there was not yet a convincing case for a further reduction in interest rates.  First, the balance of news over the month had been broadly neutral.  While sterling had risen in the past month, part of that reflected the stronger outlook for UK output growth.  Moreover, mortgage credit growth and approvals and other housing market indicators were stronger;  there was more evidence that the trough in output growth had been passed, so that the outlook was now more for a ‘gentle take off’ than ‘a soft landing’;  the labour market was apparently still tight, although the evidence was mixed and hard to assess;  and the falls in commodity and import prices seemed to be coming to an end.  Second, the inflation forecast, which incorporated all the news over the quarter including sterling’s sharp rise, did not decisively point to an interest rate reduction.  Two years out, the central projection (the mode) was near the target but rising, and with the balance of risks on the upside.  If rates were to be reduced by a further 25 basis points, both the mode and the mean would be above the target at two years. Thus, any immediate reduction in rates would probably be short-lived, especially if sterling fell back, as assumed in the projections.  Third, it was important not to create confusion about how the Committee analysed and responded to exchange rate changes.  There were dangers in appearing to change interest rates in response to high frequency movements in the exchange rate.  In particular, it would be highly undesirable if the market reached the mistaken conclusion that the Committee had a simple rule of thumb for trading off interest rate changes against exchange rate changes. A further reduction in interest rates could not be ruled out if the risks of undershooting the inflation target increased.  But it would be better to see more evidence on the position of the labour market and on domestic inflationary pressures generally, and whether sterling’s strength persisted.  A statement explaining that policy might need to be eased further if sterling remained so high would therefore be useful. 32 On a second view there was a clearer case for an immediate further reduction of 25 basis points.  The central projection was below target throughout the forecast period.  Moreover, contrary to the majority view as reflected in the Inflation Report fan chart, the balance of risks to inflation was on the downside.  There were not good grounds for expecting sterling to fall by more than implied by interest rate differentials—on the contrary it was plausible that it would remain strong given the range of factors supporting it;  the risks to world activity and prices were on the downside;  and there could be greater pressure on margins than assumed in the central projection.  The current stance of policy was still restrictive.  A statement connecting a cut to sterling’s strength would also be desirable, possibly combined with intervention. 33 In the view of most members of the Committee, the arguments were finely balanced between no change and a small reduction.  The projection did not require a further cut in interest rates but would not be inconsistent with one.  The judgment was therefore partly a matter of tactics, and centred on the best approach to addressing the problems with the balance of the economy created by sterling’s strength, consistent with achieving the inflation target. Arguments identified for an immediate cut were as follows. Inflation was projected to be below target throughout the forecast period.  The risks of undershooting in the relatively near term were greater than of overshooting further out, especially if the new monetary framework had increased the speed of the transmission mechanism.  Given the saucer shape of the projection, with inflation rising through and beyond the second year, delay could mean losing the opportunity for a future reduction, and could therefore risk denting confidence, which in some sectors remained fragile.  It would also be easier this month to explain the role played by the exchange rate in a decision to reduce rates, given that the Inflation Report was being published the following week;  the Report could explain the Committee’s analysis of the recent appreciation and make clear that there was no simple rule of thumb relating changes in the exchange rate and interest rates.  That might be less easy in a non-Inflation Report month.  Arguments identified against reducing rates, in addition to those summarised in paragraph 31, were as follows.  There was not a pressing need to take further action at present to underpin output given that it was projected to recover towards trend, and it was in any case possible that some easing of conditions would come from sterling declining, as projected, at least in line with interest rate differentials.  A cut now might therefore mean that rates had to be increased quite soon. In principle there should be no problems with that.  But given the still incomplete understanding of the Committee’s monetary policy reaction function, such a reversal might adversely affect sentiment. The uncertainties about the effects of a further reduction might also warrant caution.  Whether or not rates were reduced, a statement drawing out the implications of the exchange rate for policy would be useful.  If rates were left unchanged, the statement could explain that if sterling were to remain so strong then, depending on other developments in the economy, interest rates might have to be reduced in order to reduce the risks of undershooting the target.  It was also argued by some that the case for a reduction would be stronger if it could sensibly be accompanied by foreign exchange intervention as well as a statement.  If, however, the case for intervention could not effectively be made in current market circumstances, which was the view of some members, then the argument for an immediate reduction was weaker. 34 The Governor invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate be maintained at 5.25%.  Five members of the Committee (the Governor, Mervyn King, Alan Budd, Charles Goodhart and John Vickers) voted for the proposition.  Four members of the Committee (David Clementi, Willem Buiter, DeAnne Julius and Ian Plenderleith) voted against, preferring a reduction of 25 basis points. 35 The following members were present: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Alan Budd Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers 36 Gus O’Donnell was present as the Treasury representative.  Inflation Report:  August 1999 62 1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by the Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee on 30 April, in advance of its meeting on 5–6 May 1999.  At the start of the Committee meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and that information is included in the Annex. I The international economy 2 Consensus Economics’ forecasts for GDP growth in 1999 had continued to be revised up for the United States, and down for Germany and Japan.  G3 nominal effective exchange rates had moved little since the MPC’s previous meeting, though the euro had weakened further, and the volatility of the yen had decreased. 3 According to the advance estimate of US GDP in 1999 Q1, quarterly GDP growth had slowed to 1.1% from 1.5% in 1998 Q4. Domestic demand had risen by 1.8%, largely due to strong consumption.  Consumer confidence had increased further in April, suggesting that strong consumption growth would continue.  Net exports had fallen in Q1, partly reflecting the unwinding of special factors that had boosted net exports in Q4.  Industrial production had risen by only 0.1% in March, though the NAPM index of industrial confidence had remained strong, and durable goods orders had increased by 2.0% in March.  Housing market activity had continued to be robust, though house price inflation remained moderate.  Employment cost growth had decreased in 1999 Q1, and consumer price inflation had remained subdued, despite a further fall in the unemployment rate to 4.2% in March.  Since the previous MPC meeting there had been a rise in market expectations of US interest rates and in government bond yields.  And though equity prices had initially fallen, they had since recovered strongly.  US broad money growth had continued to slow. 4 In the euro area, recent data releases had confirmed that GDP had risen by 0.2% in 1998 Q4.  The twelve-month growth rate of industrial production had continued to slow in February, and business confidence had fallen again.  Consumer confidence had also fallen in the euro area, particularly in Germany.  Germany’s six Institutes had revised down their forecasts for German growth. Euro-area broad money growth had remained steady, but narrow money growth had risen strongly.  This could only partly be explained by the effect of lower interest rates on money holdings in some smaller countries.  Euro-area price inflation had continued to be subdued, albeit with substantial differentials between member countries.  The ECB had reduced interest rates by 50 basis points on April 8, though short-term euro-area interest rates had fallen by less, as the markets had already priced in much of the ECB’s rate cut.  Long rates had also fallen. 5 The Bank of Japan had maintained the overnight call rate at 3 basis points, and rates on longer-term instruments had continued to decline.  Low overnight rates had resulted in funds being withdrawn from the call market, which might have explained the rise in deposit money (up 9.4% in the year to March).  After rising in 1998, the growth of cash in circulation appeared to have stabilised, and the risk premium on Japanese interbank borrowing had fallen to near zero, possibly because of perceptions of increased financial market stability.  The annual rate of decline of bank lending and bankruptcies had continued to diminish, perhaps reflecting government policy measures aimed at small firms. However, the value of bankruptcies had reached a new monthly record in March, and unemployment had risen to 4.8%.  Inventory levels had continued to fall, and though industrial production had increased by 2.2% in March, most of this rise was offset by downward revisions to earlier months.  New construction orders had risen by 5% in the year to March, suggesting that the fiscal stimulus measures were taking effect.  But private demand had remained weak.  This, together with reduced imports of erratics, had resulted in continued falls in imports.  Consumer prices had fallen by 0.4% in the year to March. 6 Spreads on government bonds in emerging markets over  US Treasuries had continued to narrow over the month, and a number of major emerging market currencies had appreciated. Emerging market foreign currency financing had risen in 1999 Q1 owing to increased bond financing in Latin America and Asia. However, the Institute of International Finance had projected that total net external financing of emerging markets would fall in 1999 overall.  On balance though, Consensus Economics’ forecasts for emerging market growth had been revised up since February. II   Monetary and financial conditions 7 Notes and coin had grown by 0.7% in April (after adjusting for the introduction of the new £2 and 50 pence coins).  The strong flow pushed the twelve-month growth rate to 5.7%:  a seven-month high.  The three and six-month annualised growth rates were both higher than the twelve-month growth rate. 8 M4 had grown by £2.9 billion in March.  The twelve-month growth rate was 6.9%, the lowest since June 1995. 9 M4 lending had increased by £6.7 billion in March, though this strong growth had been in part affected by temporary lending (£1 billion) to the company handling the securitisation of part of the Student Loans book.  Excluding this effect, the twelve-month growth rate (excluding securitisations) had been 7.3% compared with 7.0% in February.  Despite the strong growth in March, the trend decline in M4 lending seen over the past six months seemed likely to continue:  the annualised three and six-month growth rates (6.6% and 6.0% respectively) remained below the twelve-month rate. 10 Households’ M4 had increased by £0.9 billion in March. The twelve-month growth rate had been 6.5%.  The annualised three-month growth rate for 1999 Q1 had been 3.8%:  the lowest since 1994 Q2.  The weakness in the first quarter may in part have reflected the increased concentration of income tax payments in that quarter following the introduction of self-assessment. Additionally, the March figure had been depressed by an outflow of funds into PEPs:  retail unit trust sales had totalled a record  £1.8 billion (seasonally adjusted).  Households’ M4 lending had grown by £3.9 billion in March.  Total lending to individuals (excluding lending to unincorporated businesses, but including lending by a number of non-M4 institutions) had increased by  £4.4 billion (0.8%) in March, reflecting a strong increase in secured lending. 11 Private Non-Financial Corporations’ (PNFCs’) M4 had grown by £2.4 billion in March.  The strong growth in March was reflected in the figures for 1999 Q1.  The twelve-month growth rate in 1999 Q1 had been 9.2%, the highest since 1996 Q4.  PNFCs’ M4 lending had grown by £1.4 billion in March.  This flow had been somewhat stronger than the monthly average for 1999 Q1  (£0.9 billion).  PNFCs’ sterling capital market issues had risen from £2.4 billion in 1998 Q4 to £6.1 billion in 1999 Q1. 12 Other Financial Corporations’ (OFCs’) M4 had fallen by £0.5 billion in March.  The total flow in 1999 Q1 was -£3.1 billion, the first negative flow since 1993 Q2.  The twelve-month growth rate had fallen sharply in 1999 Q1 to 6.6%, compared with 15.6% in 1998 Q4.  OFCs’ M4 lending had increased by £1.3 billion in March, though this had been inflated by the temporary lending to Annex:  Summary of data presented by Bank staff  Monetary Policy Committee 63 the company handling the securitisation of part of the Student Loans book.  Even without adjusting for this lending, the twelve-month growth rate in 1999 Q1 had been 8.4%, less than half the 17.5% annual growth rate in 1998 Q1. 13 Turning to price indicators of monetary conditions, there had been little reaction of short-term interest rate expectations (as measured by the near-term short sterling futures contracts) to the  25 basis point reduction in the official repo rate on April 8. Nominal forward rates had increased over the period since the April MPC meeting, with the rise concentrated at the short end of the zero-coupon gilts yield curve.  Analysis of bank and building society variable interest rates indicated that the 25 basis point reduction in the official repo rate on 8 April had been only partially passed through to standard variable rate (SVR) mortgages and savings rates. 14 Implied real forward interest rates, derived from index-linked gilts, had risen on the month, particularly following the announcement of the results of the index-linked gilt auction on  28 April. 15 Turning to measures of inflation expectations, the rise in real forward rates had been reflected in a tick down in longer-term inflation forward rates, as derived by a comparison of yields on nominal and index-linked gilts.  Survey-based measures of RPIX inflation expectations were broadly unchanged at 2.2%–2.3% for 1999 and 2000.  Data from a Consensus Economics survey in April, measuring longer-term inflation expectations, showed that inflation expectations over the period 2001–04 had risen slightly since the previous survey in October 1998. 16 Equity indices had risen sharply in April with the FT-SE 100 and All-Share indices reaching new record highs, but they had fallen below their peak by the time of the May MPC meeting.  The FT-SE All-Share index had risen by 0.3% since the April MPC meeting and by 11.5% since the February Inflation Report. 17 Turning to the exchange rate, sterling’s effective exchange rate had appreciated by 2.8% since the April MPC meeting.  This reflected an appreciation of 3.1% against the euro and 2% against the US dollar.  A decomposition based on the UIP identity implied that around half of this appreciation was accounted for by ‘monetary news’. III Demand and output 18 The preliminary ONS estimate of GDP growth in 1999 Q1 had been 0.1%, the same as in 1998 Q4.  The annual rate of growth had fallen to 0.7%, the lowest rate since 1992.  Service sector output had grown by 0.4% in Q1, compared with 0.5% in 1998 Q4. Within services, distribution output growth had picked up to 0.6% in Q1 from 0.1% in Q4 and had been implicitly offset by slower growth in other services.  The ONS press release had suggested that there had been a small decline in manufacturing output in Q1 and a sharp decline in utilities output, but that construction and agricultural output had increased in Q1.  Volatile energy output was likely to have reduced GDP in Q1. 19 Manufacturing output had fallen by 0.8% in the three months to February but growth had been strong in, for example, electrical industries.  Engineering new orders had been positive in February; home new orders had risen by 9.9% in the three months to February and export orders had risen by 5.2%. 20 On the expenditure side of the National Accounts, retail sales had grown by 0.4% in March compared with a fall of 0.3% in February, and by 1.1% in Q1 following a fall of -0.2% in Q4. Annual growth had risen to 1.9% in March and had been 1.5% in Q1.  Annual growth in car registrations had been 3% in Q1 and 95% in the year to March, following the move to bi-annual registrations.  Although the new seasonal pattern had been unknown, it was possible that underlying spending on vehicles had fallen between Q4 and Q1. 21 The March CBI Distributive Trades survey had shown a pick-up in expected sales in April, and was subsequently confirmed by the April survey.  The GfK consumer confidence balance had been +1.7 in April compared to +1.6 in March, and the MORI indicator had risen sharply towards 0 in March, in line with the GfK measure of general confidence. 22 Both the Halifax and Nationwide house price indices had shown small rises in April (0.2% and 0.1% respectively).  Regional data from the Halifax Building Society showed house price inflation had continued to slow in London and the South East in 1999 Q1.  But recent survey evidence from the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) had indicated a strong turnaround in March in house price inflation in London and the South East.   23 Housing activity indicators had picked up.  In March loan approvals had risen by 13% and net lending by 36%.  The HBF site visits and net reservations had been positive for three months and particulars delivered had risen by 6% in March.  RICS sales growth had risen in Q1.  The number of properties on estate agents’ books had been at an historic low. 24 The PSNCR had been £7.4 billion in March.  The PSNB had been £4.1 billion.  For the financial year 1998/99 the PSNCR had been -£7.4 billion, the first surplus since 1990/91.  The surplus had been £2.2 billion higher than in the Budget, with £1.3 billion lower spending and £0.8 billion higher receipts.   25 Surveys had provided evidence on investment in Q1.  The BCC Survey of manufacturers had shown a slight improvement, with a balance of +4% increasing investment in plant and machinery.  But the CBI investment intentions balance had fallen slightly to -29%.  The BCC services investment intentions balance had remained above its average at +18% in Q1.  Data on imports of capital goods and the production of investment goods had suggested increases in equipment investment in Q1.  The new orders data had contrasted with the CIPS Construction survey index which had risen to 57.4 in April, the third consecutive rise in activity.  The CIPS survey had shown increases in all sectors, other than civil engineering.  Housing had been particularly strong, with 2.9% growth in private housing starts in the three months to February and 3.3% growth in completions.    26 The Bank’s regional Agents had conducted a survey of their contacts on the effect of the Millennium on investment spending and stocks.  Millennium investment spending had already been carried out by 92% of contacts and, of these, 40% intended to spend more before the Millennium.  This had mainly been related to IT systems and the Year-2000 problem and, generally, those who had not increased spending had modern systems already.  65% of investment had been additional, 38% had been brought forward (including replacing systems early rather than tampering with existing systems) and 13% had displaced other investment.  Of investment yet to be undertaken, 44% would be additional and 23% would be brought forward.  Many contacts had not yet made a decision on Millennium stocks, but 24% planned to increase stocks and 4% already had.  Retailers had expected strong demand for food and alcohol but there had been no expectation of food shortages.  Some manufacturers would be increasing stocks of finished goods to meet demand or disruption to supply. 27 The CBI Industrial Trends reported stock balance had risen to -2, compared with -14, in Q4 but stocks had still been reported to be more than adequate in Q1.  The rise in retail sales in Q1 may have further reduced retail stocks with a relatively low +15 balance of CBI retailers reporting more than adequate stocks in March. 28 The goods and services trade deficit had narrowed slightly to £2.6 billion in February because of a narrowing of the goods  Inflation Report:  August 1999 64 deficit;  the services balance had been unchanged.  Exports and imports of goods had risen in February.  The EU goods deficit had widened in February to £1 billion from £0.7 billion in January, but the non-EU goods deficit had narrowed sharply in both February and March.  Excluding oil and erratics, export volumes to the non-EU had risen by 8.7% in February and 5.4% in March, but exports to the EU had fallen by 3.3% in February.  The rise in exports to the non-EU had been fairly widespread including rises to the US, Asia and oil-exporting countries. 29 Some surveys had provided evidence for the outlook in Q2. The BCC home sales, CBI reported output, and CIPS output survey balances appeared to have bottomed out but had still been negative. CBI and BCC domestic and export orders had picked up but remained low.  The CBI April survey had shown a loss of momentum in the recovery of export orders, which may have been related to sterling’s resilience and the European slowdown.  The BCC home sales and CIPS business activity surveys had also suggested that the service sector slowdown may have been close to its trough.  CBI business optimism had risen sharply to -6 in April compared with -40 in March;  this may have suggested a trough in GDP, but the relationship between the two had not been particularly close in recent quarters. IV  The labour market 30 LFS employment had grown by 80,000 (0.3%) in the  three months to February, compared with the previous three months.  Workforce jobs data for the final quarter of 1998 had been revised downwards, further widening the gap with the LFS measure in growth rate terms.  The absolute rise in LFS employment had been evenly split between full-time and part-time:  full-time employment had increased by 44,000 (0.2%) in the three months to February and part-time employment by 38,000 (0.6%).  Total hours worked had been flat in the three months to February, and average hours worked per person had fallen by 0.2%.  The recent expansion in employment had been offset by a decline in average hours worked per full-time worker, consistent with a fall in overtime working. 31 The CIPS April surveys reported that manufacturing employment had continued to decline, albeit at a slower rate, but employment in the construction and service sectors had increased. Forward-looking surveys had been mixed.  The BCC services survey for Q1 had shown that employment intentions were close to their historic average, while the manufacturing balance had been lower than the average.  The CBI manufacturing survey balance had become less negative.  The Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services survey had suggested that the demand for employees had risen in April. 32 The number of new notifications at job centres had fallen by 500 in March, but the stock of unfilled vacancies had risen by 400. However, the vacancy figures for Northern Ireland had been affected by a discontinuity in March caused by the introduction of  a new computer system, and problems had been discovered with past West Midlands data.  Excluding these regions, the underlying trend for vacancies had been broadly flat since early 1998.  The National Press Recruitment Advertising index had fallen in March, to its lowest level since December 1996.  The BCC survey for Q1 had suggested that recruitment difficulties had persisted, but according to the CBI Industrial Trends survey for Q1 skill  shortages had shown a sharp decline, to their lowest level since 1993. 33 LFS unemployment had increased by 32,000 in the three months to February, compared with the previous three months;  the rate had edged up to 6.3%.  Claimant-count unemployment had risen by 2,000 in March, following a revised increase of 5,700 in February, although the rate had remained unchanged at 4.6%. Inflow rates to the count had risen but remained low by historic standards, while LFS data suggested that redundancies had increased.  LFS figures showed that there had been a fall of 73,000 in the number of economically inactive people in the three months to February, which had been concentrated among the long-term sick, people looking after family/home, and students. 34 Whole-economy annual average earnings growth, as measured by the AEI, had increased to 5.0% in February, reflecting faster growth in service sector earnings inflation.  Both public and private sector earnings growth had risen in February.  The headline annual rate of whole-economy earnings growth (now referred to by the final month of the three-month period under consideration, rather than the centred three-month average) had increased to 4.6% in the three months to February, from a revised 4.5% in January. The revision in January, due to late returns, had reflected a stronger contribution from bonus growth.  There had also been a change in the survey questionnaire between January and February.  Prior to February, the questionnaire had asked respondents to identify bonuses paid to employees when the bonus had changed significantly.  With effect from February 1999, information on all bonuses had been required, irrespective of the magnitude.  Because of this discontinuity, it had not been possible to assess the contribution of bonuses to the rise in average earnings growth in February.  In contrast to the AEI, the Reward Index of annual earnings growth had continued to decline into 1999, from 4.6% in January to 4.5% in February and 4.2% in March.  35 The Bank’s measure of the whole-economy employment-weighted mean wage settlement (twelve-month moving average) had fallen to 3.6% in March, having remained at 3.7% since June.  Using a matched sample (ie only including firms where data were available for both years), the twelve-month mean settlement had decreased to an annual rate of 3.2% for the three months to March 1999, from 3.9% a year earlier.  Provisional information for April had suggested that public sector settlements for 1999 had been higher than in 1998.  There had also been reports that some settlements had been delayed to April to coincide with the implementation of the National Minimum Wage. 36 Revisions to Workforce jobs data had resulted in some minor revisions to productivity and unit wage cost growth, but the picture had been broadly unchanged.  Annual productivity growth had been 0.7% in Q4 and unit wage costs had been accelerating.  V Prices 37 The Bank’s index of commodity prices excluding oil had risen by 1.9% in March.  The total index had risen 5.5%, reflecting the very sharp increase in oil prices in March.  The monthly rises had led to the annual rates of inflation in both indices to rise, though both had remained negative.  The Bank’s measure of commodity prices had increased in the first quarter, whereas both the Economist and the Economist Intelligence Unit measures had fallen.  The difference had been explained by the use of different weights and baskets of commodities. 38 The oil price had risen sharply again in April:  the one-month future price of Brent crude rose by 20.3%.  Evidence from options prices had suggested that the oil price expected in August had increased since the previous MPC meeting, and that there was slightly greater uncertainty around the estimate, but that the risks around the expectation were more balanced (though still slightly on the upside).  Producer price inflation had increased in March:  input prices largely due to oil and food prices, and output prices because of oil prices and duties. 39 Import and export price had fallen again in February, by 0.1% and 0.6% respectively.  But annual inflation had increased to -4.1% and -3.6%, the highest rates since November and December 1996 respectively.  The annual rate of retail sales deflator inflation had fallen by 0.4 percentage points to 0.8% in March.  The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) rose by 1.7% in  the year to March, 0.2 percentage points more than in February,  Monetary Policy Committee 65 owing to the effects of the measures introduced in the March Budget. 40 The annual rate of RPIX inflation had risen by 0.3 percentage points to 2.7% in March, for the same reasons as the HICP.  The rate excluding taxes and excise duties (RPIY) had fallen by 0.1 percentage point to 1.7%, and the all-items rate of inflation (RPI) had remained at 2.1%, as lower mortgage-interest payments had offset the Budget effects. VI  Reports by the Bank’s Agents 41 The Bank’s regional Agents reported on their assessment of the economy, drawn from their discussions with contacts over the past month.  There had been continued indications that the decline in manufacturing output growth had come to an end.  Expectations for output growth in the second half of 1999 had improved. Investment plans had remained focused on cost reduction and product development.  Some manufacturers had continued to invest overseas, while others had postponed investment as demand remained subdued.  Service sector growth had increased once again, especially advisory services such as accountancy and IT. But the transport industry had continued to report declining demand and increasing fuel costs.  Consumer services activity had grown only modestly.  Some leisure industry contacts had reported that expansion of capacity was no longer planned.  Import penetration had increased, especially for commodities.  And overall export growth had been reduced by sterling’s appreciation, although certain sectors such as aerospace and telecommunications had reported export growth.  German demand had declined but demand from elsewhere in Europe and from North America had remained strong, and there had been modest signs of a recovery in orders from East Asia.   42 Retail sales growth had been subdued;  exceptions had included DIY, mobile phones and personal computers.  Annual sales growth had improved in March and over Easter, but discounting to clear unwanted stocks had persisted.  Discount store sales had continued to grow while department store sales had  fallen.  Demand for new and used cars had been flat in the first quarter of 1999.  There had been a modest increase in demand for housing, part of which had been due to strong demand for properties to rent.   43 Annual pay settlements had generally remained subdued, typically ranging from 0% to 3% in manufacturing and from 2% to 5% in the service sector.  But some individual pay settlements had been higher as companies had sought to retain key staff. Manufacturers had reported ongoing job losses.  But manufacturers had been reluctant to shed staff, preferring to rely on natural wastage or to defer decisions in the hope of an upturn in orders.  In contrast, service sector recruitment had continued. VII Market intelligence 44 Expectations of UK interest rates implied by prices from financial markets had risen significantly over the past month.  The market’s view of the level of interest rates in 2000 and 2001 in particular had increased.  Three groups of views had emerged in the market on the likely direction of future interest rate decisions.  The first was that interest rates had reached a ‘trough’ at 5.25%;  this view emphasised rising prices in asset markets and growing evidence from surveys of increasing business and consumer confidence.  The second group had noted that, while rates might be near to their lows, the risks were still on the downside, and a further reduction in rates was therefore to be expected in the next month or so.  The third group believed that the prospect remained for further interest rate reductions:  the improvement in surveys had been from a low base, there was a danger of undershooting the inflation target of 21/2%, and the exchange rate had remained strong.  Despite these differing market views, the range of interest rate expectations for the next two years had narrowed since the start of January, when some in the market had not expected rates to fall as quickly as they had now done, and others had envisaged deeper cuts in interest rates than they now thought in prospect.  This suggested that the market now had a clearer view of the UK’s position in the interest rate cycle.   45 Sterling had remained strong over the month, particularly against the euro.  Expectations of the level of the exchange rate over the next twelve months, based on forward exchange rates and surveys, suggested that sterling would remain close to its current level against the US dollar.  However, market data still suggested that the pound would weaken against the euro over the same period. The appreciation of sterling since the start of the year had surprised some forecasters.  A number of possible explanations had been advanced, including changes in the expected relative cyclical positions of the United Kingdom and Continental Europe.  Market commentators had also suggested that the risk premium on the euro had risen, with the factor most recently cited being the conflict in Kosovo.  Over the past month, there had been a number of short-term influences on the exchange rate.  There had been demand for sterling related to merger and acquisition activity. Some market participants suggested that there had been portfolio shifts in favour of sterling.  And one bank with a large share of the customer market in foreign exchange had reported that its clients had bought back large amounts of sterling over a comparatively short period of time, reversing previously underweight positions.   Inflation Report:  August 1999 66 1 At the start of the meeting on 9 June, the Committee formally acknowledged the receipt of a letter from the Chancellor (attached as an annex) setting out the inflation target at which the Committee should aim in accordance with section 12 of the Bank of England Act 1998.   2 Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee reviewed developments in sterling, the world economy, monetary and financial conditions, demand and output, the labour market, prices and other considerations bearing on its decision.   Sterling’s exchange rate 3 Sterling had been volatile over the month, but had on average remained at broadly the same level as at the time of the May Committee meeting and somewhat above the level implied in the central assumption of the May Inflation Report.  Sterling had risen against the euro since the May MPC, but had fallen against the dollar.  Much of the depreciation of sterling against the dollar seemed explicable in terms of changes in market interest rate expectations—as implied by yield curves—since the previous meeting.  The publication of the much stronger than expected Japanese GDP data on 10 June was associated with a marked strengthening of the yen, and partly as a consequence an easing of sterling.   4 The depreciation of the euro against sterling and the dollar could not be accounted for purely by movements in interest rate differentials, and was more difficult to explain.  Among short run factors, developments in Kosovo might explain some of the weakness in the euro, perhaps through increasing uncertainty and via its potential effects on business and consumer confidence in continental Europe.  The markets might also be re-assessing the policy stance in the euro area in the light of the recent discussions of the Italian fiscal deficit in the context of the growth and stability pact.  A more fundamental factor was probably continued uncertainty about the prospective strength of the euro area economy when contrasted with continuing strong growth and the pick-up in consumer prices in the United States.   5 The strength in German orders data, and a stronger first quarter GDP figure than expected by the markets, had probably contributed to the slight strengthening of the euro immediately prior to the Committee’s meeting.  But if it simply reflected an expectation of stronger German demand, this was not apparently embodied in interest rate expectations. 6 Summing up, the Committee noted that the depreciation in the euro since the turn of the year was not especially large in an historical context.  Nevertheless, looking at a rate for the synthetic euro against the dollar over a longer period, the euro was stronger than in the early and mid-eighties, but as low as at any time over the past ten years. 7 Turning to sterling, it was difficult to link recent changes in its rate against the euro to past and prospective movements in interest rate differentials.  Whether or not the Committee cut at this meeting, the market might take the view that a trough in interest rates had been reached for this cycle.  If that caused expectations of the future path of interest rates to be revised up then sterling might strengthen.  However, it was possible that a reduction in rates at the current meeting might be accompanied by a fall in sterling.  So, as always, the effect on the exchange rate of a possible reduction in interest rates was uncertain.  And, in any case, the Committee agreed that whatever the expectation in the market, the future path of interest rates would depend on what developments in the economy as a whole implied for the prospects for inflation.  8 It was also noted that an increase in US rates and further reduction in UK interest rates could eliminate the present  short-term interest rate differential.  This could be important to those with ‘carry trades’—a strategy of borrowing in low yielding currencies to buy higher yielding currencies.  There was evidence that some market participants used this strategy.  Views differed on how much weight to put on this explanation of sterling strength. 9 Overall, the Committee thought that the situation had not changed much since the previous month’s meeting.  Sterling had remained, on average, somewhat above the central assumption in the May Inflation Report over the past month, and if it were not to weaken as assumed, it raised the likelihood that inflation would undershoot the target. The world economy 10 There was not much sign of a slowdown in the US economy over the month.  The Federal Open Market Committee had recently moved to a bias to tighten.  Equity markets had been relatively stable over the month.  Taken together the news suggested that the probability of a soft landing for the US economy had improved.   11 Some of the backward looking data in the euro area continued to look quite weak.  But the recent orders and unemployment data had been better than expected.  German GDP had increased by 0.4% in the first quarter, and was slightly stronger than expected by the markets, but it contained little news relative to the Committee’s central assumption in its May projections.  The more forward-looking indicators—such as consumer and business confidence—had perhaps shown signs of stabilising. 12 Many of the recent Japanese monthly indicators had been distorted by the Golden Week holidays, which made seasonal adjustment more difficult.  But, on balance, they probably suggested that activity was broadly flat.  Growth in the monetary base had, however, increased.  The GDP figure for the first quarter—released on 10 June—had been surprisingly strong and the stock market had initially rallied.  But no analysis of the GDP data was yet available.  The Committee noted that there had been quite large quarterly volatility in Japanese GDP over recent years, so were cautious in reading much into one strong quarterly number. 13 The yields on dollar-denominated bonds issued by emerging market economy governments had risen relative to US Treasury bond yields as expectations of a tightening of US monetary policy had increased, though they had shown signs of easing back down more recently.  But prospects in Asia seemed a little brighter than a month ago, as did the situation in Brazil and Latin America more generally.  Some official Chinese interest rates had recently been reduced by 1%. 14 Overall, the news on prospects for the world economy had been mildly positive over the month, with the euro area and Japan looking a little stronger.  The prospects of a soft landing in the United States seemed to have improved, and the downside risks to emerging markets might have eased. Monetary and financial conditions 15 The strength of the housing market was evident in both price and activity data.  The Halifax and Nationwide house price indexes had both risen strongly in May, and the annual rates of increase were now rising.  The aggregate rise in house prices over recent months was probably within the bounds of what might be expected given changes in interest rates since last autumn.  There were signs of the strengthening housing market in the household sector lending Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 9–10 June 1999  Monetary Policy Committee 67 figures, which had continued to rise over recent months.  The Committee recalled that looking forward, its assumption in the central projection of the May forecast was that house prices would rise in line with nominal earnings, which would need to be reviewed in the context of the next forecasting round. 16 Forward short maturity interest rates had risen substantially over the past month, in part reflecting changing expectations about the timing of possible UK entry into EMU and in part accompanying the rise in short maturity rates in the US.  Longer maturity nominal bond yields had risen—reflecting those factors and continued fading of the after-effects of the LTCM crisis, which had depressed yields—whereas there had been little change in the yields on UK index-linked government bonds.  The Committee discussed the implications of these developments for real rates and inflation expectations.   17 As discussed by the Committee at its January meeting, there was some uncertainty about the level of real yields signalled by index-linked bonds.  In particular, past changes to rules relating to pension fund holdings of bonds had led to an increased holding of index-linked bonds by that sector.  It seemed that the changes had prolonged effects on yields, as stock holdings were adjusted following actuarial guidance.  But it was not clear that this would have significantly distorted the change in implied UK inflation expectations over the past month.  However, there had only been a slight rise in inflation expectations in the surveys of other forecasters’ projections, which on average had now risen back towards the inflation target of 2.5%.  Therefore, since it was not plausible that inflation expectations had risen by as much as short maturity forward rates, it was likely that short-term real yields had risen. 18 At the short end of the curve, there were signs that building society and other lenders had raised interest rates on fixed rate mortgages, so some tightening had occurred.  For loans advanced on variable, rather than fixed, interest rates, there had been only a small pass-through of the reduction of official rates in April.    Demand and output 19 The latest data provided no firm reasons to move away from the central projections for demand and output made at the time of the May Inflation Report.  GDP growth had been revised down 0.1% in the first quarter, and was now flat on the headline market price measure and had fallen slightly measured at basic prices. After adjusting for volatile components such as energy—which had been weak in the first quarter—growth of GDP at basic prices was still in line with the May central projection, at 0.1%.  The staff’s latest estimates, based on survey evidence on new orders, suggested a pick-up in GDP growth in Q2.  This pick-up was still broadly consistent with the May central projection.  The National Institute of Economic and Social Research had released its monthly GDP estimate following publication of the industrial production figures. It showed growth of 0.2% in the three months to May, which also suggested an increase in growth from the trough at the turn of the year. 20 Within the expenditure breakdown of GDP, there were some signs that the usually less-volatile components—such as consumption—were stronger on the quarter, while those that were typically more volatile—such as investment—were weaker. However, even in the case of consumption there were special factors.  In particular, the change in the registration date for new car sales meant that seasonal adjustment of the Q1 data was difficult and that underlying consumption was probably a little weaker than the headline numbers suggested.  That said, the figure was still likely to have been stronger than the Committee had assumed in its May projections.  There had been a continuing rise in consumer confidence over recent months.  One puzzle was the recent weakness of retail sales in both the official data and in surveys, given the strength of Q1 consumption and consumer confidence.   21 Business surveys had also shown signs of further improvement over the past month, although the tone being reported to the Bank’s regional Agents was, on balance, a little softer than this.  The latest monthly trade data had pointed to a greater weakening of exports—particularly to the EU—compared to the assumption in the May Inflation Report.  The CBI survey, while showing an improvement in domestic orders, still recorded considerable pessimism about export orders.  The corresponding question in the CIPS survey had, however, shown a recovery in export orders.  Although the latest batch of surveys had been conducted after the recent appreciation in sterling, there was some concern about the fragility of the overall rise in survey balances, especially if sterling were to remain strong.  The Bank’s regional Agents’ survey suggested that many companies were expecting sterling to depreciate. 22 The income and expenditure release of the National Accounts also included a sharp fall in the figure for companies’ operating profits in the first quarter, which followed a fall in the fourth quarter.  The latest evidence on the number of profit warnings, and analysts’ profit expectations for 1999, did not yet provide any corroborative evidence of such a sharp fall in the first quarter.  It was difficult to know how much weight to place on the fall, until firmer data on profits had been fed into the accounts by the ONS.  The operating profit figure included an adjustment, to ensure that the income, expenditure and output measures were aligned from quarter to quarter, but the details of any adjustment in Q1 would not be published by the ONS until the full National Accounts release.  The ONS had suggested that the construction output figures were less firmly grounded than usual.  As usual, in the run up to the annual re-balancing of the National Accounts there were a number of puzzles in the data, and there were likely to be revisions in due course.  It was not possible at this stage to draw any firm conclusions about the likely direction and scale of any revisions. Labour market 23 There had not been much news on labour market quantities over the past month, relative to what had been expected in the May projections.  But looking back over the past three or four months it was, perhaps, still surprising that the labour market had not weakened by as much as expected at the start of the year.   24 On the prices side, earnings growth in the year to March, as measured by the Average Earnings Index, had been in line with the assumption in the May Inflation Report.  The Reward index had continued to fall.  The disparate movements in the public and private sectors complicated the picture for settlements.  Recent public sector awards had pushed up the aggregate whole economy twelve-month employment-weighted mean to 3.9%, despite a continuing fall in private sector settlements.  A matched sample of private sector settlements also showed that they were lower in April than in the corresponding period last year.  More work would be needed on the impact on RPIX inflation of the public sector settlements, both directly and indirectly via their effects on private sector behaviour.  As the April figures were not yet available, it was still too early to judge whether the effect of the National Minimum Wage on earnings was in line with the assumption made in the Committee’s projections. 25 The continued strength in the latest employment data implied another weak productivity growth figure in the first quarter, and a corresponding rise in unit labour costs.  This would continue the pattern of weak productivity growth figures seen over the past four years.  The fact that employment continued to grow, and that there had been no significant rise in unemployment, might be consistent with the finding of the Agents’ survey.  The survey results suggested that, while many companies assumed no change in sterling, more companies were expecting sterling’s exchange rate to fall than to rise, and companies might consequently be delaying adjustments to their workforce for as long as possible.  However,  Inflation Report:  August 1999 68 this could not explain much of the apparent weakness of productivity growth in recent years.  Another possible explanation, among several discussed in recent Inflation Reports, continued to be that output was underrecorded, and that the true rate of productivity growth was stronger than recorded, although there was no firm evidence for this.  The limited data available for the service sector, relative to manufacturing, made it difficult to reach conclusions in this area. 26 Looking at productivity growth over a longer period, it was probably best to assume that the trend rate of productivity growth— which was what was important for assessing inflationary pressure—had not changed significantly over recent years.  Indeed, average productivity growth since 1990 was not out of line with its long-run historical trend. Prices 27 The Committee noted that both including and excluding oil, sterling commodity prices on the Bank’s UK demand-weighted index were now rising in annual terms.  The oil price had stabilised in recent weeks.  Brent was currently trading at around $15–$16 per barrel, and was a little below the peak reached in early May.  The oil price was now broadly in line with the assumption made in the May Inflation Report for the middle of this year.  28 RPIX inflation had fallen by slightly more than expected in April, largely on account of seasonal foods, which were usually quite volatile.  The latest ONS advance estimate of RPIX, which was not usually available at the time of the Committee meeting, suggested that the May figure would also turn out weaker than had previously been expected.  Although this seemed likely to have implications for the short-term inflation projection, it was not clear to what extent there was any news for the inflation projections looking two years or so ahead.  The recent and prospective fall in RPI inflation to levels well below RPIX, on account of previous reductions in mortgage interest rates, might further reduce pay settlements. Other considerations bearing on the policy decision this month 29 The Committee’s statement the previous month explaining its decision had said that if sterling were not to decline as assumed in the central projection of the May Inflation Report, it was likely that inflation would undershoot the inflation target over the coming two years.  And, in those circumstances, depending on other developments in the economy, there might, therefore, need to be further easing of interest rates in order to keep inflation on track to meet the 21/2% target.  At this meeting the Committee reviewed the time frame over which it might need to take action if sterling remained strong and there were no other offsetting developments affecting the inflation outlook.  One issue was how big the deviation in exchange rates from the May assumption needed to be in order to be quantitatively significant in terms of the forecast of inflation.  Another issue was the appropriate filter to use to smooth high frequency movements in the exchange rate.   The immediate policy decision 30 On one view a further reduction in the official interest rate of 25 basis points was needed to meet the inflation target.  There were various strands to this argument, to which members attached different weights. 31 The exchange rate had on average been stronger over the past month than incorporated in the May Report.  If that strength were to persist, then the likelihood of inflation falling below target would have increased.  Although the statement issued last month did not mean that action had to be taken immediately if sterling did not weaken as assumed in the central projection, there seemed to be no advantage in waiting. 32 Some members of the Committee were uneasy, on empirical grounds, about the use of the Uncovered Interest Parity assumption in the central projection, and for them sterling’s persistent strength was not a surprise.  They placed weight on the observation that a further reduction in UK rates, and the future increase in US  rates expected by the market, might mean that the UK would  no longer have the highest short-term interest rates of the G7 countries. 33 Some members were also impressed by the fact that since the turn of the year, sterling had consistently turned out stronger than assumed each month.  And although the May Inflation Report fully reflected the appreciation of the exchange rate in the first  part of the year, its persistent rise created a greater sense of underlying strength and weakened perceptions of the likelihood of the sustained fall in sterling that was assumed in the central projection.   34 Private sector wage settlements had continued to fall, although there had been a rise in public sector settlements.  The fall in RPI inflation relative to RPIX might further depress settlements. In addition to the news on the exchange rate, the recent outturns and short-term outlook for RPIX suggested that the saucer shape evident in the May central projection for inflation would, if anything, be a little deeper and more protracted than thought then. It might be possible to mitigate this slightly by prompt action, without risking too sharp an upturn in prospective inflation further ahead.   35 Although house prices were rising, so far this seemed consistent with the reduction in interest rates since October.  The yield curve had steepened over the past month, and interest rates at maturities of 1–4 years had risen substantially so that, to the extent that this represented a rise in real rates, some tightening had effectively taken place.   36 Some members thought that, although the forward-looking survey indicators were stronger over the past month, consumer and business confidence indicators were still fragile.  There was still relatively little firm evidence from official data that activity had picked up in the second quarter.  The latest trade data had suggested that the immediate outlook for exports was still deteriorating.  The recent weakness of retail sales in both the official data and in surveys, while supported by the Agents’ reports, was puzzling.  It suggested that expenditure was not yet accelerating.  A further reduction in interest rates might help to support business and consumer confidence, which would make the projected upturn in activity more likely, especially in the light of the Agents’ survey of companies’ exchange rate expectations. 37 Overall, as sterling had not fallen back and given developments in private sector wage settlements and the short-term outlook for retail prices, as well as the tightening of monetary conditions during the month through the rise in short-term market interest rates, those members who had voted for a reduction in the official interest rate the previous month remained of that view;   and some others agreed that the balance of risks to inflation  now warranted a modest reduction in the official interest rate this month. 38 On another view, there was not a convincing case for a further reduction in the official interest rate.  There were three main considerations.  First, sterling had been volatile over the month, and the level of the exchange rate index on the morning of the Committee meeting was not significantly different from that assumed in the central projection of the May Inflation Report.  It was better not to place too much weight on high frequency movements in sterling between quarterly Inflation Report projection rounds.  Second, there had not been much news to change the picture for activity over the past month.  The world economy looked a little brighter.  On the domestic economy,  Monetary Policy Committee 69 backward-looking indicators were mixed.  Output growth had been revised down a little but non-oil output was still rising.  Most forward-looking indicators—such as household and business surveys—continued to improve.  Consumption growth was strong and house prices had risen sharply over the past month.  The full effects of the earlier reduction in interest rates from 7.5% to 5.25% had yet to be seen.  There were no strong grounds for diverging from the central projection in the May Report.  Third, even though there had been little news on activity, RPIX inflation had turned out a little weaker than expected.  In consequence, the short-term outlook for inflation was if anything a little lower than a month ago, but there was only a limited amount that the Committee could do at this very short horizon.  The implications of the latest ONS advance estimate of RPIX were not clear.  In setting monetary policy it was necessary to look further ahead.  Looking further out, there was little to change the view, embodied in the May projection, that the benign effects on inflation of the rise in sterling and falls in import prices would be wearing off as domestic activity recovered.  There had also been a slight rise in inflation expectations as measured by surveys, which was an indicator that the Committee had placed weight on in the past. 39 The Governor invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate be reduced by 25 basis points to 5.0%.  Eight members of the Committee (the Governor, David Clementi, Willem Buiter, Charles Goodhart, DeAnne Julius, Ian Plenderleith, John Vickers and Sushil Wadhwani) voted for the proposition.  Mervyn King voted against, preferring to maintain the Bank’s repo rate at 5.25%. 40 The following members were present: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers Sushil Wadhwani 41 Gus O’Donnell was present as the Treasury representative.  Inflation Report:  August 1999 70 1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by the Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee on 3 June, in advance of its meeting on 9–10 June 1999.  At the start of the Committee meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and that information is included in the Annex. I The international economy 2 Strong economic growth had continued in the United States. After a downward revision of 0.1 percentage point, owing to weaker net trade, GDP was estimated to have increased by 1.0% in 1999 Q1.  The annual growth rate of industrial production had increased to 2.0% in April and the level of output in March had been revised up, bringing the official data more into line with the National Association of Purchasing Managers’ (NAPM) index.  The growth rate of export volumes had also picked up, with a noticeable rise in sales to Asian countries.  But, despite this improvement in exports, the March trade deficit had reached a record level  ($19.7 billion) owing to continued strong import growth.  More recently, however, retail sales and employment growth had slowed. The slowdown in the rate of job creation in May was sharper than most commentators had expected, but revisions to March and April data raised the level of non-farm payrolls by 185,000. 3 A few signs of price pressures had begun to emerge.  The NAPM prices-paid index rose above 50 in May, the first time it had exceeded the neutral level since December 1997.  And consumer price inflation had increased by 0.5 percentage points in April, to 2.3%.  Both of these developments were heavily influenced by higher oil prices.  More surprisingly, ‘core’ inflation had also risen and the annual growth rate of average earnings had increased to 3.6% in May.  Reflecting these developments, the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) had adopted a bias towards tightening monetary policy.  In response, financial market expectations for an increase in official interest rates had been brought forward.  On  9 June, the markets were expecting the FOMC to raise interest rates by at least 25 basis points by September and to implement a further tightening over the next two years.  The rise in interest rate expectations had led to a slight flattening in the nominal US Treasury yield curve. 4 Within the euro area, the gap between business and consumer confidence had continued to narrow in May, reflecting weaker consumer confidence and an improvement in business confidence.  Consumer confidence had been particularly weak in Italy.  Euro-area industrial production had been flat in March, though stronger in France and Spain than in Germany and Italy. Broad money growth had remained moderate but narrow money was growing rapidly.  In Q1, German GDP had increased by 0.4% and French GDP had grown by 0.3%. 5 Japanese data had been distorted by the Golden Week holiday in April, but the underlying trend appeared to be flat.  The Bank of Japan had kept overnight interest rates at 0.03%, and term rates were beginning to decline suggesting that the monetary easing was being passed through.  However, total bank lending had continued to fall, as banks had continued to write-off non-performing loans.  Industrial production had fallen by 2.7% in April, reversing the rise in March.  Housing starts had increased by 1.1% in the year to April, the first rise since December 1996. However, private construction orders had fallen sharply in April, more than offsetting the rise in public construction orders related to the November fiscal package.  The unemployment rate had remained at a record 4.8%;  employment had decreased and inactivity had increased.  The trade surplus had narrowed in April as import growth had exceeded export growth.  The deflationary trend had persisted;  in April, ‘core’ consumer price inflation was  -0.1% and domestic wholesale price inflation was -1.9%. 6 In the financial markets, the euro had continued to depreciate, while the yen and dollar effective exchange rates had appreciated over the month.  The Nikkei-225 index had fallen by 4% since the May MPC meeting while the S&P 500 had fallen  by 2%.  Spreads on emerging market bonds had widened slightly, but the nominal exchange rates of these countries were little changed. II Monetary and financial conditions 7 The growth rate of narrow money had been rising.  In May, the three and six-month annualised growth rates for notes and coin, after adjusting for the introduction of the new 50 pence and £2 coins, had increased to 7.7% and 7.4% respectively, up from around 5.0% last autumn.  Econometric work by Bank staff suggested that recent interest rate cuts were likely to have started to boost narrow money growth from around the end of last year. 8 M4 had risen by 1.1% (or £8.8 billion) in April, compared with an average monthly flow of just £2.7 billion in the first quarter of this year.  M4 lending had also been strong, rising by 0.9% (or £7.8 billion) on the month. 9 The M4 deposits of the household sector had increased by 1.1% (or £5.1 billion) in April.  This figure would have been influenced by:  the introduction of cash ISAs (which attracted deposits of £1.8 billion over the month);  windfall payments of  £0.6 billion to account-holders at Birmingham Midshires following the Halifax takeover;  and the purchase by the Prudential Corporation from a charitable trust (which is included as part of the household sector) of £0.6 billion of M&G shares.  Together these special factors had probably accounted for only around £1.5 billion of the monthly flow (some of the money going into ISAs probably came from the windfall, and some would have reflected a portfolio reallocation away from taxable savings instruments within M4). Adjusting for these considerations, the flow had been around £3.6 billion, significantly stronger than the average monthly increase over the past year (£2.4 billion). 10 M4 lending to the household sector had increased by 0.8% (or £4.0 billion) in April.  Total lending to individuals, by both M4 and non-M4 financial institutions, had also been strong, rising by £4.4 billion on the month.  Within the total, lending secured on dwellings had been a little weaker than in March, though the monthly flow (£3.0 billion) had remained well above the average for the past year.  Consumer credit growth had increased slightly to 1.4% in April. 11 Private non-financial corporations’ (PNFCs) M4 deposits had been weak in April, falling by 0.1%.  At the same time these companies had borrowed heavily:  strong sterling borrowing from UK banks and building societies was matched by strong capital issues.  Total borrowing by PNFCs had been £6.5 billion in April. The available evidence suggested that these funds were largely being used for investment, and were not an indication of distress borrowing.  Over the year to 1999 Q1, net recourse to banks (net new borrowing minus net new deposits) was much stronger in the service sector, where investment had been strong, than in the manufacturing sector, where any borrowing to cover unexpected shortfalls in cashflow might have been expected to have been concentrated. 12 OFCs’ M4 deposits had increased by 2.1% (or £3.8 billion) in April.  This strong flow followed three consecutive months in Annex:  Summary of data presented by Bank staff  Monetary Policy Committee 71 which OFCs’ M4 deposits had fallen.  OFCs’ M4 borrowing had risen by 0.6% in April. 13 Turning to price indicators of monetary conditions, there had been a marked rise in interest rate expectations implied by  longer-dated short-sterling futures contracts:  the rate implied by the September 2001 contract had increased by almost 60 basis points since the previous meeting, to 6.4%.  A variety of explanations were considered.  First, stronger-than-expected US CPI data, coupled with the FOMC’s adoption of a bias to tighten monetary policy, had increased expectations that US interest rates might soon be raised.  This could have had implications for UK interest rate expectations if, for example, market participants believed that US inflation data were a leading indicator of  world-wide inflationary pressure.  Second, some domestic data releases over the month suggested a more buoyant outlook for the UK economy. 14 It appeared that mortgage lenders had still not fully passed on the 8 April reduction in the official repo rate.  Conversely, there had been large falls in credit card rates reflecting increased competition in that sector. 15 Nominal forward interest rates had increased by some 40 to 45 basis points at the three to five year horizon since the previous meeting.  Over the same period, real forward rates had increased by around 5 basis points, so it appeared that medium-term inflation expectations (ie three to five years ahead) had also increased by 35 to 40 basis points.  It was possible that the ‘true’ rise exceeded this: demand for certain gilts to repo for cash over the Millennium period was thought to have increased and this had led to artificially low nominal gilt yields.  A measure of inflation expectations three years ahead derived from the swap curve had risen by around 65 basis points.  Conversely, survey measures of inflation expectations for the years 1999 and 2000 had either not increased or risen only moderately (by 10 or 20 basis points) and had remained below the 21/2% target. 16 The sterling effective exchange rate index had fallen by 0.1% since the May meeting, to 104.6.  This was somewhat higher than the level embodied in the central projection of the May Inflation Report.  Sterling had appreciated by 0.7% against the euro, and fallen by 1.6% against the US dollar.  Most of the fall against the dollar was probably related to monetary policy news, in particular a growing expectation that US interest rates would soon be raised.  Sterling’s rise against the euro was harder to explain in terms of monetary policy news.  Compared with the previous meeting, UK equity prices were broadly unchanged. III Demand and output 17 Quarterly GDP growth in 1999 Q1, at constant market prices, had been revised down from 0.1% to 0%, reducing the annual growth rate to 0.6%.  The weakness of GDP in Q1 had been influenced by a sharp decline in energy related output due to the mild winter—excluding the energy, utility, and agriculture sectors, GDP had grown by 0.1%.  However, measured at basic prices, output had fallen by 0.1% in Q1, the first decline in seven years.  In the first quarter, the level of the expenditure measure of GDP had been 0.7% below the average measure. 18 The downward revision to GDP growth in Q1 had reflected a lower service sector growth estimate of 0.2% (down from 0.4%). Within the service sector, distribution output had increased by 0.6%, transport and communications had grown by 0.2% and business and financial services had fallen by 0.3%. 19 Largely reflecting the weakness of energy output, total industrial production had fallen by 0.9% in Q1.  Although manufacturing output had continued to decline, the pace of contraction had slowed to 0.3% in Q1, from 1.3% in 1998 Q4. Construction output had increased by 0.2% in the first quarter but had been 3% lower than a year ago.  The ONS had noted that these figures were less firmly based than normal.  Agriculture and fisheries output had fallen by 0.5% on the previous quarter and by 0.6% on a year ago. 20 The expenditure breakdown of GDP had shown domestic demand growing by 0.4% in Q1, with inventories making a contribution of -0.2 percentage points.  However, this growth in domestic demand had been offset by a -0.5 percentage point contribution to growth from net trade.  The main differences between the expenditure outturns and the projections embodied in the May Inflation Report had been stronger consumer spending and weaker investment. 21 Consumer expenditure had grown by 1.1% in 1999 Q1, the highest quarterly growth rate for over a year.  Spending on vehicles, durable goods, clothing, communications, and financial services had all been strong.  However, it was likely that the vehicle expenditure figures had been influenced by the introduction of the changes to the vehicle registration scheme in March.  Pre-tax compensation of employees had grown by 1.9% in the same period. Government expenditure had risen by 1.4%. 22 Total investment had declined by 1.7% in Q1, but had grown by 3.1% on a year ago.  Business investment had fallen by 2%, largely owing to steep declines in construction and ‘other production’ investment.  In Q1, manufacturing investment had fallen by 2.5% while service sector investment had increased by 1.1%.  Corporate profits had deteriorated further—the gross operating surplus of corporations had fallen by 3.2% in Q1 and  by 9.4% in the year to Q1.  However, the actual size of the decline in corporate profitability in the first quarter was uncertain, since these data incorporated the quarterly statistical alignment adjustment.  23 In the first quarter, the trade deficit at constant market prices had increased to 4.3% of GDP.  Export volumes of goods and services had fallen by 1.4% while import volumes had risen by 0.3%.  The goods and services deficit at current prices had widened to £4.6 billion in Q1—the highest figure since 1990. Geographically, demand from EU countries had been particularly weak in Q1—goods exports to the EU had fallen by 4.1%, while sales to non-EU countries had been little changed.  Imports of goods had increased by 1.7% in Q1 and by 2.4% in March.  The latest monthly trade data pointed to a larger negative contribution to GDP growth in Q1 than had been assumed in the May Inflation Report. 24 Turning to developments in Q2, retail sales volumes had fallen by 0.5% in April.  However, in the three months to April, sales volumes had increased by 1.8% on a year earlier and by 0.6% on the previous three months.  Total car registrations had fallen by 3.9% in May, lowering the annual growth rate to 1.8%, from 6.6%. The CBI Distributive Trades survey had reported lower annual sales growth in May, although orders placed with suppliers had increased sharply.  According to the CBI, expected sales growth for June had been the strongest since July 1998.  The GfK consumer confidence index had also increased in May, leaving it at its highest level in twelve months. 25 The rise in consumer confidence had been accompanied by a pick-up in housing activity.  The number of particulars delivered had increased by 5% in April, and by 9% on a year earlier. Similarly, the number of loan approvals had gone up by 15% in the three months to April.  Reflecting these developments, the Halifax and Nationwide house price indices recorded monthly rises of 2.1% and 1.2% in May, with annual inflation at 5.7% and 7.4% respectively.  House price inflation in London and south-east England had exceeded the national average since the mid 1990s, and survey evidence from the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors had suggested a continuation of this trend.  Inflation Report:  August 1999 72 26 The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) manufacturing output index had been 53.1 in May, the second month in a row in which it had been above the neutral level of 50. The recovery had been led by consumer goods producers;  the index for investment goods had remained negative.  New orders, both domestic and export, had improved significantly since October 1998.  Similarly, the CBI’s survey measures of total orders and output expectations had also increased in recent months.  However, according to the CBI, export order books had shown no improvement in May. 27 The CIPS services output index had been 56.4 in May, well above the neutral level for the third month running.  The CIPS construction survey had reported a rise in construction activity for the fourth consecutive month in May, with the total activity index at its highest level for 14 months, and housing activity had grown at its fastest rate in the last two years.  28 A survey by the Bank’s regional Agents covering 140 firms had revealed that the strength of the exchange rate had affected manufacturing firms more adversely than service sector companies. The majority of firms surveyed expected that the pound would remain broadly unchanged or depreciate against the euro over the next twelve months.  But, there was little expectation that the sterling-dollar exchange rate would move much in the next year. Most of the manufacturing firms surveyed had indicated that sterling’s strength was impacting negatively on both their domestic and external market share.  In contrast, the majority of service sector firms surveyed had indicated little impact of the level of sterling on their domestic or export market performance. IV The labour market 29 Employment had continued to grow, but at a slower pace than in the second half of 1998.  According to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), employment had risen by 63,000 (0.2%) in Q1, down from 0.4% in 1998 Q4.  Most of the slow-down had reflected slower growth in part-time employment.  Provisional data had suggested that manufacturing employment had continued to fall in Q1.  The CIPS surveys for May had also pointed to a further fall in manufacturing employment and a slowdown in the pace of service sector job creation.  By contrast, the surveys suggested that construction sector employment growth had increased.  The May Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services (FRES) survey had pointed to rising demand for permanent placements and temporary staff for the third month running. 30 Total hours worked had risen by 0.3% in the three months to March, but had been only 0.1% higher than a year earlier.  The rise in Q1 had reflected the fact that average hours worked by full-time employees had been flat, having previously been falling.  The proportion of employees who usually worked more than 45 hours per week had continued to fall in Q1, perhaps reflecting the impact of the Working Time Directive. 31 Discrepancies identified by the ONS in the official series for the number of outstanding Job Centre vacancies meant that the data had become an unreliable indicator of recent trends in vacancies. Notifications of new Job Centre vacancies—which the ONS considered a more reliable measure—had been broadly flat since late 1994.  However, the national Press Recruitment Advertising Index (which has a high proportion of professional jobs) had continued to fall quite sharply. 32 The claimant count had declined by 17,400 in April, but had been distorted by difficulties with seasonal adjustment around the Easter period related to changes in the entitlement of students to unemployment benefit.  LFS unemployment had risen by 24,000 in Q1.  Aggregate unemployment rates on both measures had remained broadly stable in recent months.  Short-term LFS unemployment (duration less than a year) had risen, as it had for the previous six months, and long-term unemployment had fallen less rapidly than in previous quarters.  The relative dispersion of regional unemployment rates had increased further, and had now returned to typical levels seen over the past 25 years, having been extremely low for much of the early 1990s. 33 The combination of higher employment and higher unemployment had been associated with a further fall in inactivity of 47,000 in Q1, according to the LFS;  rather less than in the previous quarter. 34 The official headline measure of annual earnings growth had increased to 4.8% in March.  Both public and private sector earnings had risen;  on a sectoral basis, the main contribution had come from the service sector.  By contrast, the Reward Index had suggested that earnings growth had fallen, to 4.2% in March and 3.9% in April.  But temporary divergences of this size between the Average Earnings Index (AEI) and the Reward Index have not been unusual.  According to the FRES survey, the balance of those reporting a monthly rise in pay rates for agency placements had risen slightly in both April and May.  And rough calculations suggested that growth in earnings per hour had remained stronger than that in earnings per head. 35 It was not possible to say how much of the rise in the AEI headline rate in March had reflected higher growth in bonuses. Although the official data had appeared to show a sharp rise in the contribution of bonuses to annual earnings growth and a fall in the annual growth of regular pay, both series had been distorted by a change in the method used to collect bonus data.  Investigations by the ONS had shown no evidence that the change in bonus reporting had had any distorting effect on the reporting of total gross pay, so the headline AEI rate should have been unaffected.  The decline in profits growth in recent quarters suggested that profit-related bonuses could be growing more slowly than previously.  But bonuses were also influenced by other factors, including labour market tightness and structural changes in the use of bonus and performance-related pay. 36 The Bank’s average twelve-month whole-economy wage settlement measure had increased from 3.6% in March to 3.9% in April.  But no settlement information had yet been received from about a quarter of the firms usually in the sample, and the Bank’s database over-represented the public sector.  Applying the AEI weights to the sectoral indices suggested that weighted settlements had risen only 0.1 percentage point, to 3.7%, in the twelve months to April.  A matched sample had suggested that private sector settlements had continued to fall in April, compared with a year earlier.  Other reports had also suggested a further slight easing in wage settlements.  The Bank’s Agents had reported that upward pressures on wages were limited, although some employees were being awarded above-inflation increases because of skills shortages. V Prices 37 Oil prices had stabilised in May, averaging $15.83 per barrel. The Bank’s non-oil commodity index had increased by 1.7% in the year to April, the first positive annual inflation rate since 1996. This had been mainly the result of higher domestic food and fuel prices (83% of the non-oil index). 38 Largely reflecting the effects of higher oil prices, input price deflation had moderated;  in the year to April the index had fallen by 1.3%, following an annual decline of 3.8% in March.  Similarly, output prices had increased because of higher petroleum prices and duties, but annual producer price inflation excluding duties (PPIY) had stayed subdued, at -0.3%.  Both the CIPS and the CBI surveys had suggested continued producer price deflation.  Import and export prices had risen slightly in March, mainly because of higher oil prices. 39 Annual retail sales deflator inflation had remained at 0.7% in April while annual GDP deflator inflation had fallen to 2.0% in 1999 Q1, from 2.6% in 1998 Q4.  The fall had been largely  Monetary Policy Committee 73 accounted for by lower contributions from the household expenditure and net export categories.  Indicators of domestically generated inflation had also fallen in Q1—the GDP-based measure declined to 2.5% and the RPIX-based measure to 4.2%. 40 RPI and RPIX inflation had declined to 1.6% and 2.4% respectively, reflecting the dropping out from the twelve-month comparison of the 1998 Budget road-fuel price effects and weaker food price inflation.  In April, annual HICP inflation had fallen by 0.2 percentage points to 1.5%. VI Reports by the Bank’s Agents 41 The Bank’s regional Agents reported on their discussions with contacts over the past month.  Confidence levels in the manufacturing sector had risen, following subdued activity in Q1, but there had been little evidence of increasing orders. Manufacturers had expected limited growth in the second quarter. Demand from export markets had improved;  US demand had remained strong and demand from East Asian and Middle East countries had increased.  But sterling’s appreciation had forced exporters to cut prices to retain market share and had caused greater import penetration.  Manufacturing investment intentions had remained concentrated on productivity gains rather than capacity increases.  An increasing number of manufacturers had begun to consider investing abroad. 42 Annual retail sales growth had been sluggish.  Retail contacts had expectations of limited sales growth in the second quarter and retail property investment intentions had declined. Sales volumes growth had been largely dependent on price discounting.  Sales of fashion and homeware goods had been  below normal for the time of year, but strong mobile phone and personal computer sales growth had persisted.  Car dealers had reported weak annual sales growth, heavy discounting and a reluctance to build stocks for the new registration in September.  In contrast, annual leisure sector growth had continued;  restaurants, entertainment venues and tour operators had all reported increased consumer spending.  Investment intentions had remained strong. Housing market activity had risen overall;  new building had increased, with many first-time buyers evident.  That said, growth had been strongest in London and south-east England;  elsewhere, significant pockets of negative mortgage equity had persisted. 43 Manufacturing employment had continued to fall and skill shortages to ease.  Any labour hoarding had tended to reflect  short-term factors, such as waiting for enquiries to become orders, rather than longer-term concerns about replacement of skills. Manufacturing wage growth had fallen, despite the continued need, in many cases, to buy out profit-related pay schemes.  Service sector wage growth had remained stronger, though with wide variations depending on individual performance and sector.  Skill shortages had continued to ease, even in competitive sectors such as IT, suggesting less upward pressure on future service sector wage settlements.   VII Market intelligence 44 The expected UK interest rate curve implied by prices from financial markets had steepened significantly.  In particular, the market’s view of the level of interest rates in 2000 and 2001 had increased.  This reflected three main factors.  First, market expectations of an increase in US interest rates had increased during the course of the month, with US markets pricing in a rise of at least a 1/4 percentage point in the Federal Funds target rate by September 1999.  Second, the market had interpreted recent  UK data, such as the CIPS survey and Halifax price index, as  strong.  Third, some market players’ perceptions of the likelihood and timing of UK entry into EMU had changed.  This had  changed their expected path of UK interest rates over the next five years. 45 The increase in market expectations of UK interest rates had been one factor behind sterling’s continued strength in effective terms over the month.  Several other factors had influenced market sentiment, including market concern over fiscal discipline in the euro area.  Developments in Kosovo had had an impact at particular moments, but were probably less influential than in the previous month.  Information from the foreign exchange options market suggested that the downside risk to sterling had increased slightly following the statement accompanying the May MPC meeting, although the effect had not been great and had subsequently been offset by other factors.  Some market participants reported that portfolio shifts into sterling and out of the euro had continued, and that this formed part of a readjustment which brought the composition of these portfolios back closer to their historic averages.  Inflation Report:  August 1999 74 Treasury Chambers, Parliament Street, London, SWIP 3AG 0171-270 5000 18 May 1999 Mr Eddie George Governor Bank of England Threadneedle Street London  EC2R 8AH Dear Eddie REMIT FOR THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE The Bank of England Act requires that I specify what price stability is taken to consist of and the Government’s economic policy objectives at least once in every period of 12 months. The framework has performed well in its first two years.  Both you, as Chairman, and the members of your committee should be congratulated.  Inflation has remained at or around the Government’s target, within 0.2 percentage points over the last ten months.  Inflation is expected to remain close to target:  long-term interest rates are close to their lowest level for over 40 years. I believe the framework’s success reflects a number of factors.  First, the objective of monetary policy is clear and unambiguous, a symmetric inflation target.  Second, the monetary policy framework is open and transparent allowing the public to scrutinise the decisions that are made. Third an equally clear framework for fiscal policy, together with the presence of the Treasury representative at MPC meetings, has ensured the effective coordination of monetary and fiscal policy.  Finally, the high quality of the decisions made reflects the benefits of selecting members on the basis of relevant skills and expertise. Considering the above, I confirm that the MPC’s remit will remain unchanged.  I attach a copy of last year’s remit for ease of reference. Yours sincerely GORDON BROWN  Monetary Policy Committee 75 REMIT FOR THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE The Bank of England Act came into effect on 1 June 1998.  The Act states that in relation to monetary policy, the objectives of the Bank of England shall be: (a) to maintain price stability, and (b) subject to that, to support the economic policy of Her Majesty’s Government, including its objectives for growth and employment. In order to comply with the Act, this remit sets out what price stability should be taken to consist of and what the economic policy of the Government should be taken to be. Price stability I confirm that the operational target for monetary policy remains an underlying inflation rate (measured by the 12-month increase in the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments) of 21/2 per cent.  The inflation target is 21/2 per cent at all times:  that is the rate which the MPC is required to achieve and for which it is accountable. My intention is to lock into our policy making system a commitment to consistently low inflation in the long term.  The real stability that we need will be achieved not when we meet the inflation target one or two months in succession but when we can confidently expect inflation to remain low and stable for a long period of time. The framework takes into account that any economy at some point can suffer from external events or temporary difficulties, often beyond its control.  The framework is based on the recognition that the actual inflation rate will on occasions depart from its target as a result of shocks and disturbances.  Attempts to keep inflation at the inflation target in these circumstances may cause undesirable volatility in output. But if inflation moves away from the target by more than 1 percentage point in either direction I shall expect you to send an open letter to me, following the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee and referring as necessary to the Bank’s Inflation Report, setting out: — the reasons why inflation has moved away from the target by more than 1 percentage point; — the policy action which you are taking to deal with it; — the period within which you expect inflation to return to the target; — how this approach meets the Government’s monetary policy objectives. You would send a further letter after three months if inflation remained more than 1 percentage point above or below the target.  In responding to your letter, I shall, of course, have regard to the circumstances prevailing at the time. The thresholds do not define a target range.  Their function is to define the points at which I shall expect an explanatory letter from you because the actual inflation rate is appreciably away from its target. Government’s economic policy objectives The Government’s central economic objective is to achieve high and stable levels of growth and employment.  Price stability is a precondition for these high and stable levels of growth and employment, which in turn will help to create the conditions for price stability on a sustainable basis.  In the recent past, instability has contributed to the UK’s poor growth performance, not least by holding back the long-term investment that is the foundation for a successful economy. The monetary policy objectives of the Bank of England are to maintain price stability and subject to that, to support the Government’s economic policy, including its objectives for growth and employment. Accountability The Monetary Policy Committee is accountable to the Government for the remit set out in this letter.  The Committee’s performance and procedures will be reviewed by the Court on an ongoing basis (with particular regard to ensuring the Bank is collecting proper regional and sectoral information).  The Bank will be accountable to Parliament through regular reports and evidence given to the Treasury Select Committee.  Finally, through the publication of the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meetings and the Inflation Report, the Bank will be accountable to the public at large. Restatement of the Remit The inflation target will be confirmed in each Budget.  There is a value in continuity and I will have proper regard to that.  But I will also need to consider the case for a revised target at these times on its merits.  Any changes to this remit will be set out in the Budget.  The Budget will also contain a statement of the Government’s economic policy objectives. GORDON BROWN  Inflation Report:  August 1999 76 The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee today voted to reduce the Bank’s repo rate by 0.25% to 5.0%. The Committee considered recent economic developments against the background of the May Inflation Report.  Taking into account all the evidence on the inflation outlook, the Committee judged that it is now more likely that inflation will undershoot the 21/2% target, and therefore voted to reduce the Bank’s repo rate by 0.25%. The minutes of the meeting will be published at 9.30 am on Wednesday 23 June. Text of Bank of England press notice of 10 June 1999 Bank of England reduces interest rates by 0.25% to 5.0%  Monetary Policy Committee 77 Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 7–8 July 1999 1 Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed the world economy;  monetary and financial conditions;  demand and output;  the labour market;  prices and costs;  and other issues relevant to its decision. The world economy 2 The Committee considered whether the gradual improvement in the outlook for the world economy had continued over the past month. 3 In the United States activity had remained robust, although consumption growth had slowed a little.  The Federal Open Markets Committee had raised rates by 25 basis points, accompanying this with a statement that it no longer had a bias to tighten policy.  This had been interpreted by the markets as a sign that the prospect of further increases in official rates was now less immediate than they had believed before, and equity prices had reached new highs.  The timing and extent of any slowdown in activity in the United States remained unclear, and it was possible that growth might stay above trend for longer than previously thought. 4 Business confidence had picked up a little in Germany and France, with orders in Germany and Italy also showing some signs of recovery.  While the steepening of the euro yield curve might reflect some upwards revision in views on activity, this explanation was not consistent with the recent depreciation of the euro.  There was market comment that these recent movements might be explained by an increase in concerns related to the fiscal position in the euro area. 5 In Japan the recorded path of output was likely to be volatile. GDP figures indicated growth of 1.9% in the first quarter of 1999. Adjustments to reflect a variety of factors, such as seasonal adjustment techniques, might lead to the initial estimate of growth in Q1 being revised down, though it might still be above most earlier forecasts.  Even if such a revision were made, GDP might contract in the second quarter.  Nevertheless base money growth continued to pick up, equity prices had risen again and business confidence was a little less weak. 6 GDP forecasts compiled by Consensus Economics for the emerging market economies had generally been revised up over the last month.  However, this was not so for some countries, such as Argentina, where yield spreads for government debt over US Treasuries had also increased.   7 The Committee agreed that the prospects for growth in the world economy were now a little stronger than a month ago, although arguably the uncertainties in the United States had if anything increased.  If growth in the United States remained strong, and if the Asian recovery gathered pace, this might begin to put pressure on non-oil commodity prices, some of which had already begun to rise, as had commodity-related currencies and equities.  It was also argued that the level of world output remained below capacity and no major area except the United States was expected to grow significantly faster than its long-term trend during the coming year or two;  such a persistence of spare capacity in both OECD and emerging market economies would continue to restrain global prices for the time being. Monetary and financial conditions in the United Kingdom 8 Growth in narrow money had risen, with notes and coin growing at their highest rate since end-1996.  This appeared to be consistent with a pick-up in retail sales in Q2.  While broad money growth had eased overall, this had not been reflected in the household component.  It might be that the reductions in official rates were feeding through into broad money growth for households rather faster than expected, but this was by no means certain.  Total household borrowing remained robust, despite some slowing in consumer credit growth. 9 Market expectations for interest rates at the shortest maturities were if anything a little lower than a month ago. However, at the two to three year horizon, interest rates implied by short-sterling futures contracts had increased by around 40 basis points.  This might reflect a market view about the cyclical path of interest rates, particularly if market participants believed that the United Kingdom was now less likely to be part of Economic and Monetary Union in the near future.  Alternatively, the rise in expected UK interest rates might simply reflect the fact that euro rates had risen at the same maturity;  it was not clear whether such a high correlation was warranted.  Standard variable mortgage rates had moved little over the month;  there was not yet much  pass-through into retail rates from last month’s reduction in official rates.  With the steepening in the yield curve, further increases in fixed rates on new mortgages were possible. 10 The effective exchange rate index had fallen a little over the month, and was now close to the central assumption in the May Inflation Report.  It was difficult to tell how much significance should be ascribed to this decline.  Sterling had moved little against the euro, which accounted for two thirds of the exchange rate index, and was of considerable importance for many UK exporters. Sterling had fallen more against the dollar and was outside the range within which it had traded for some time.  The question was raised of whether the significance of such a decline was fully captured by the dollar’s weight in the effective index.  To the extent that the linkage between sterling and the dollar had weakened, sterling’s effective exchange rate might be less susceptible to future movements in the dollar against third currencies. Demand and output 11 While the estimate of GDP growth was unchanged for the first quarter, revisions had been made to the expenditure components.  Growth in consumption was higher than had been thought earlier, and remained strong even when adjusted for a number of special factors, such as a shift in the registration date for new vehicles.  The decline previously indicated for business investment had been reversed, although in overall terms investment was flat because of a steep fall in the general government component, which might reflect erratic timing factors.  Final domestic demand had been revised up, and was now estimated to have grown by over 1% in the quarter.  Much slower stockbuilding and a more negative contribution from net trade (reflecting higher imports) had offset these revisions, leaving the level of GDP unchanged.  It was likely that the lower starting point for stock levels would represent a more secure base for output growth in the coming quarters. 12 Retail sales volumes in the three months to May were over 1% higher than in the previous three months, and survey data also indicated a strengthening in activity, not only in services but also in manufacturing and construction.  However, reports from the Bank’s regional Agents did not suggest much of an improvement in retail conditions, with demand sluggish in many areas. 13 Data from surveys and other published sources had been used to produce estimates for GDP in the second quarter, both by  Inflation Report:  August 1999 78 the National Institute for Economic Research and by Bank staff. These suggested that growth in Q2 could be marginally higher than in the central projection in the May Inflation Report.  Such estimates were subject to error, but appeared to indicate that the recovery in output growth was on track, and that the prospects for activity were slightly better than had appeared a month ago.  One complication, however, was that the annual Blue Book dataset would be published later in July, together with the full Quarterly National Accounts for Q1, and might alter the measured profile of activity for recent years.  But the size and direction of any revisions were not yet known. 14 Indications from the housing market, reflecting data on prices, lending and transactions, all suggested a continuing recovery from the previous autumn.  Developments in this area would require continued monitoring, although they were not yet a cause for concern. 15 On balance, the Committee agreed that the news over  the past month suggested that the projected recovery in activity seemed to be underway and was if anything a little faster than expected. The labour market 16 Data on labour market quantities were also consistent with a somewhat stronger path than had been expected for activity in Q2. Employment had continued to grow, if at a slower pace, with the increase more than accounted for by full-time workers. Unemployment had again declined slightly, reflecting a fall in the numbers of the short-term unemployed.  Despite the slowdown in GDP growth over the past year, the unemployment rate was little changed from its mid-1998 level.  Overall, labour market conditions remained somewhat tighter than had been expected, and the possibility of a substantial rise in unemployment had diminished. 17 By contrast, growth in nominal earnings appeared to be slowing more than expected, with the Average Earnings Index (AEI) showing a decline in earnings growth in the private sector and in services.  The fall in the twelve-month growth rate to April was particularly marked, in part reflecting a fall in bonus payments by comparison with a year ago.  It would be unwise to place too much emphasis on a single month’s figure for the AEI, but there were other signs of a deceleration in private sector nominal earnings, for instance in the Reward index.  The Bank’s matched sample of private sector settlements also showed a decline, from 3.7% a year ago to 3.1% in April, in contrast to the rise in public sector settlements. 18 Reports from the Bank’s regional Agents and the Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services provided less evidence of downwards pressure on pay.  Nor was there any clear downward trend in the growth of earnings on a per hour basis.  In addition, one-year-ahead inflation expectations of trade unionists—as given by the Barclays Basix survey—had fallen by 0.8 percentage points over the past year, rather more than the fall in settlements, indicating that real wages were growing a little faster than a year ago.  Developments in the growth of nominal and real wages therefore seemed to be rather different.  An explanation might be that the effect of a change in inflation expectations on wage settlements was typically less than one-for-one in the short-term. 19 The Committee noted that the National Minimum Wage had come into effect in April and had been expected to raise measures of average earnings.  However, around half of those affected were thought to work in firms which were too small to be covered in the AEI sample.  This increased the difficulties of assessing the impact of the minimum wage on earnings more generally.  It was possible that more of the effect from the National Minimum Wage had been reflected in earnings before April than had previously been assumed. 20 It was possible, however, that any deceleration in nominal earnings might prove temporary.  First, during the past year, RPI inflation had fallen from over 4% to 1.3%.  If this was the measure on which wage bargainers focussed, rather than RPIX, it might help explain the slowdown in earnings growth.  But as the impact of the reduction in interest rates began to fade, growth in RPI would become closer to that of RPIX.  Second, the fall in settlements might reflect the plunge in business confidence in the autumn, when expectations of future profits had been revised down, or the sharp fall in consumer confidence, perhaps due to increasing fears of unemployment.  Since then, survey data pointed to a recovery in business and consumer confidence.  Third, lower bonus payments might reflect lower profits;  if so this might reverse as the economy recovered. 21 However, a temporary downward shock to inflation might persist for some time in so far as the settlements sought by wage bargainers were determined by recent inflation outturns.  It was also possible that supply-side factors, such as the increasing importance of the services sector, falling union membership, and labour market reforms, might have reduced the rate of unemployment at which wage inflation would tend to increase. Prices and costs 22 RPIX inflation had fallen by more than expected in May, foreshadowed by the ONS advance estimate available to the Committee at its June meeting.  This was largely accounted for by food prices, and to that extent the impact on prices two years ahead was unclear.  That depended, in part, on whether the weakness in non-seasonal food prices was transient or reflected a trend towards a compression of retail margins.  Even if the food price weakness were transient, its impact on RPIX two years out would depend on the degree of persistence of the effect of a temporary shock to inflation.  In May, other goods inflation had been marginally weaker than expected and services inflation marginally stronger. The annual retail sales deflator had fallen in the year to May—the first fall since the series began in 1986. 23 Both oil and non-oil commodity prices were higher than a year ago and continuing to rise, and evidence from the Bank’s regional Agents suggested that downwards pressure on import prices might be moderating.  But imported materials prices continued to fall in May, and it was likely that some of the lagged effects of earlier declines in import prices were still to come through to retail prices. 24 Figures for unit labour costs (derived from the wages, employment and output figures), when taken together with price data, suggested that margins might be coming under pressure.  But margins might rise again if demand picked up.  An alternative possibility was that output (and hence productivity) was higher than suggested by present estimates.  In that case potential output could also be higher;  if so, there would be no implications for inflation. 25 The Committee noted that, in the short term, RPIX was likely to remain below 2.5%, but that the extent and duration of any undershoot was uncertain.  It would depend on the extent to which this fed through into inflation expectations, on future movements in margins and the terms of trade, on changes in the output gap, and on how changes in productivity fed through into real wages.  More generally, the outlook for prices given the prospective profile of activity was less clear than the prospects for activity itself, which seemed to be somewhat stronger than earlier expected. Other issues 26 The Committee noted that the analysis and projections to be carried out for the August Inflation Report would allow it to reassess some of the puzzles in the data over the next month:  in particular the contrast between activity, which was somewhat stronger than expected, and prices, which were somewhat weaker.  Monetary Policy Committee 79 In addition, later in July new national accounts data would be published, more information on earnings would become available, and it would be easier to assess the significance of sterling’s recent movements, particularly against the dollar.  While not of themselves conclusive, these were reasons for waiting another month to get a clearer picture of the way in which the economy was developing. The immediate policy decision 27 The Committee identified a variety of arguments for leaving the repo rate unchanged at 5%.  Indicators of activity had strengthened over the past month, both in the United Kingdom and overseas.  The pattern of revisions to GDP in the first quarter, with stronger final domestic demand and imports, and weaker stockbuilding, suggested stronger growth in subsequent quarters. Indications from surveys and retail sales, as well as the money and employment data, also suggested that growth in Q2 would be a little stronger than expected last month.  However, price indicators were weaker than expected.  The sharp fall in the twelve-month growth rate of the Average Earnings Index needed more corroboration, but private sector settlements also appeared to be slowing in nominal terms.  Finally, the exchange rate had eased slightly over the month, particularly against the dollar.  The implication of these factors for inflation over the next two years or so would be examined through the work to be carried out for the August Inflation Report. 28 Further arguments for leaving the repo rate at 5% were advanced.  One was that given the impact of earlier interest rate reductions had yet to be fully seen, official rates should be kept at 5% until evidence emerged of price pressures in either direction.  A second was that rates were now close to their neutral level, and that this was appropriate given the state of the economic cycle and the evidence on employment.  A third argument was that against a background with a significant probability for inflation to undershoot the target in the short term, the Committee might be able to wait and see whether some of the developments, for instance in the labour market, as was looking increasingly likely, reflected structural changes in the economy. 29 On another view, it might have been preferable last month to have left the repo rate unchanged for the reasons set out at the time. Developments over the month had probably strengthened that argument.  Although cost increases were lower than expected, other indicators, such as domestic demand, money data and housing market activity, were pointing to a less benign inflation outlook further ahead, and the exchange rate was back in line with the central assumption in the May Inflation Report.  But there were two reasons for not reversing last month’s reduction.  First, to do so might affect business and consumer confidence disproportionately. A reduction followed by an immediate rise in interest rates, in the absence of significant news about the economy, did not necessarily have the same impact on confidence as a constant level of rates. Second, a reversal might wrongly be interpreted as a stronger signal of the future path of interest rates than was warranted.  It was desirable, therefore, to leave the repo rate unchanged this month. 30 The Governor invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate be maintained at 5.0%.  The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the proposition. 31 The following members of the Committee were present: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy David Clementi, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Willem Buiter Charles Goodhart DeAnne Julius Ian Plenderleith John Vickers Sushil Wadhwani 32 Gus O’Donnell was present as the Treasury representative.  Inflation Report:  August 1999 80 1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by the Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee on 2 July, in advance of its meeting on 7–8 July 1999.  At the start of the Committee meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and that information is included in the Annex. I The international economy 2 The international environment had improved a little over the month.  Activity in the United States had remained strong, and survey data for the euro area had been largely positive.  Growth forecasts for Asia had been revised up. 3 The final estimate of Q1 GDP growth in the United States had been revised up to 1.1% quarter on quarter, reflecting a slightly less negative contribution from trade.  In Japan, the estimate for Q1 GDP growth had been surprisingly strong, at 1.9% quarter on quarter.  But this most probably overestimated underlying activity. Monthly activity data had suggested weaker growth, and it is possible that some of the public investment reflected orders booked in Q1 that would materialise in Q2.  In the euro area, the preliminary estimate of Q1 GDP growth was 0.4% quarter on quarter, in line with the May Inflation Report projection. Consumption and investment had grown strongly, while net trade and destocking each subtracted from growth.  In Italy, GDP had increased by 0.2% in Q1. 4 The pattern of growth in the major industrialised economies reflected ongoing adjustment to the emerging market crises of the past two years:  net trade had made a negative contribution to growth in the major industrialised economies over the past two quarters.  Industrial production in the United States had remained steady at around 2% at an annual rate.  Data for the euro area as a whole were available only to February.  More timely data were available for some individual economies;  German industrial production had risen by 1.0% in April, but that was still 1.3% lower than a year ago, while French industrial production had fallen by 0.3% in April, and had been flat on the year-on-year comparison. Retail sales data had showed no sign of a slowdown in consumer spending in the United States.  In Japan, retail sales had been stronger than last month, but still lower than a year ago.  In the euro area, lack of timely data and distortions caused by the timing of Easter made retail sales data hard to read;  German retail sales had risen by 4% in March and fallen by 4% in April. 5 In the United States, the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) had increased the Federal Funds target rate by 25 basis points to 5.0% on 30 June and reverted to a neutral stance towards monetary policy.  Interest rates implied by futures contracts had fallen after the FOMC announcement.  Short-term inflation expectations had picked up recently, possibly reflecting the rise in energy prices, but long-run inflation expectations had remained flat. Overall the data suggested that consumption had perhaps slowed a little in Q2, but nevertheless remained robust.  Consumption had risen in May, but sales data suggested a slowdown in June. Consumer confidence and employment, however, had risen further in June.  Some signs of slowing had been apparent in housing sales, but mortgage growth, which appeared to have fuelled consumption, had remained high. 6 The forward-looking information available from surveys indicated a further narrowing of the gap between business and consumer confidence in the euro area in May and June.  Business confidence had risen a little (from a low level) and consumer confidence had fallen slightly (from a higher level).  The IFO survey of business confidence in western Germany and the French INSEE business survey had both risen in May, partly reflecting improvements in foreign orders.  Italian orders had also picked up. In the United States, the National Association of Purchasing Managers Index had risen above market expectations in June, reflecting rises in the sub-indices for production and new orders. The export orders index had also risen.  In Japan, the Tankan survey had shown a small improvement in business sentiment, reflecting better financial conditions. 7 International data on consumer price inflation in  May suggested that the pick-up in April had been temporary.   In the United States, consumer price inflation fell to 2.0%, from 2.3% in April;  for Japan, May’s figure was -0.4%;  and in the  euro area inflation on the harmonised measure had fallen back to 1.0%. 8 Turning to global financial markets, the yen had reached a high of 118 against the dollar around the time of the release of Q1 GDP.  Since then, several rounds of intervention had brought it back into the 120–122 range.  Implied volatility had subsequently fallen sharply.  Japanese bond yields had risen slightly, and equities more markedly, over the month, following the strong GDP data.  In the euro area, expectations of short-term interest rates had risen over the past month. II Monetary and financial conditions 9 Narrow money growth had remained robust.  The  twelve-month growth rate of notes and coin, after adjusting for the introduction of the new 50 pence and £2 coins, had risen to 7.0% in June, the highest rate since December 1996. 10 M4 had risen by £3.4 billion (0.4%) in May.  The annual rate of growth had slowed to 7.0%.  The slowdown in aggregate M4 and aggregate M4 lending had been largely driven by Other Financial Corporations’ (OFCs’) M4 and M4 lending.  OFCs’ M4 deposits had fallen by £2.0 billion in May, and lending to OFCs had fallen by £1.8 billion in May. 11 The M4 deposits of the household sector had risen by 0.6% (or £2.9 billion) in May.  The growth rate of households’ M4 deposits had increased generally since 1998 Q2.  M4 lending to the household sector had remained strong;  it had risen by 0.6% (or £3.1 billion) in May, leaving the twelve-month growth rate unchanged at 7.9%.  Total lending secured on dwellings had fallen from £3.1 billion in April to £2.7 billion in May, although gross lending had remained strong.  Approvals in May had been strong and, reflecting  the current ‘tight’ state of the housing market, many banks and building societies were now allowing consumers to carry approvals forward if their offers were rejected.  This had caused the stock of loan approvals outstanding to rise sharply, and could have altered the relationship between the stock of approvals and secured lending.  Monthly consumer credit growth had fallen from 1.3% in April to 0.6% in May, though this in part could have reflected a switch to mortgage equity withdrawal leaving total borrowing for consumption still strong in 1999 Q2.  Compared with a year earlier, consumer credit growth remained robust at over 17%. 12 Private Non-Financial Corporations’ (PNFCs’) M4 deposits had been strong in May, rising by 2.1% on the month (or  £2.6 billion).  However, this figure had been inflated by a large temporary item;  adjusting for this, the flow in May was negative. Lending to PNFCs had fallen by 0.4% on the month (or £0.8 billion).  The sharp rise in capital issues since the beginning of the year had continued. Annex:  Summary of data presented by Bank staff  Monetary Policy Committee 81 13 Turning to price indicators of monetary conditions, interest rate expectations implied by longer-dated short-sterling futures contracts had risen since the previous MPC meeting:  the rate implied by the September 2001 contract had risen by close to 40 basis points to around 6.80%.  Expectations of interest rates in the euro area and Japan had risen over the month, which might have contributed to the increase in interest rates implied for the United Kingdom. 14 Nominal forward rates at maturities of 3 to 5 years had risen by between 35 and 45 basis points since the previous meeting;  this rise had been in line with the rise in longer-dated short-sterling futures contracts.  Longer rates (beyond about 9 years) had fallen by up to 55 basis points.  This pattern had also been reflected in swap rates and corporate bond yields which rose by similar amounts at 3 to 7-year maturities. 15 Real interest rates derived from the index-linked gilt market had been broadly unchanged since the previous meeting, suggesting that the rise in nominal rates largely reflected increased inflation expectations.  Survey-based measures of inflation expectations available each month had also risen, but by less than those  implied by yield curves.  According to the survey measures, the  rise in nominal interest rates could be split approximately half  and half between a rise in real rates and a rise in inflation expectations. 16 The Consensus Economics Forecasts measure of the expected average inflation rate over the next two years had risen since 1999 Q1 by 20 basis points, to 2.3% in 1999 Q2.  But over the same time period, the Barclays Basix survey suggested that inflation expectations for the next two years had ticked down.  In particular, trade union expectations for the year ahead had fallen from 2.7% in Q1 to 2.5%. 17 The Bank’s survey of advertised interest rates suggested that the 25 basis point cut in the repo rate in June had not been passed through to standard variable mortgage rates.  Moreover, fixed-rate mortgages had risen over the month:  for example, average 5-year fixed mortgage rates with no lock-in had risen by around 20 basis points to 6.20% in June.  Furthermore, spreads between fixed-rate mortgages and swap rates had narrowed in recent months, suggesting that further increases in mortgage rates were possible. Unsecured loan rates and savings rates had been broadly unchanged on the month. 18 The FT-SE All-Share index had risen by around 3% to 3069 since the previous meeting, with small and mid-capitalisation stocks continuing to outperform the FT-SE 100.  Information technology, resources and cyclical consumer goods stocks had performed relatively well over the month. 19 The sterling effective index had fallen by 1.0% since the June meeting to 103.5, approximately 0.1% below the level implied by the central projection of the May Inflation Report.  Sterling had fallen by 0.6% against the euro and 2.6% against the dollar. Movements in sterling over the month appeared largely unrelated to changes in UK yields relative to overseas. III Demand and output 20 According to the latest ONS release, quarterly growth of GDP at constant market prices had been unrevised at 0.0% in 1999 Q1.  But the annual rate had been revised up by  0.1 percentage points to 0.7%, and there had been revisions to the expenditure composition of growth in Q1.  No revisions had been made to previous quarters, pending the release of the full 1999 Q1 National Accounts.  Stronger household consumption and investment in Q1 had been offset by weaker contributions from net trade and stockbuilding.  The difference between final domestic demand and GDP growth had widened in Q1. 21 Quarterly growth of gross value added at constant basic prices had been revised up from -0.1% to 0.0%, with service sector growth revised from 0.2% to 0.4%, largely the result of an upward revision to the transport and communications sector (up from 0.2% to 1.3%).  Excluding the erratic energy and agriculture sectors, the quarterly growth rate of GDP had been 0.2%.  22 Household consumption growth in Q1 had been revised up from 1.1% to 1.4%, the highest quarterly growth rate since 1997 Q2.  Within this, spending on vehicles, household goods, clothing and footwear, and financial services had been particularly strong.  The strength of spending on vehicles had probably been affected by the timing change to new vehicle registrations.  But this had not accounted for all the strength in spending in Q1. 23 Government consumption growth had been unrevised at 1.4% on the previous quarter.  Investment growth in Q1 had  been revised up from an unexpectedly low -1.7% to 0.0%.   Higher business investment, revised up from -2.0% to 1.7%,  had offset a sharp fall in general government investment (-19.2%). The increase in investment had been concentrated in the service sector. 24 On the income side of the accounts, the gross operating surplus of corporations had been revised up from -3.2% to -3.0%. The sharp fall in Q1 had been the largest since 1974 Q1, and was the result of a 4.2% fall in private non-financial corporations, only partially offset by a 4.8% rise in financial corporations.  The fall in gross operating surplus had looked sharp, relative to survey evidence and profits warnings, but the inclusion of the alignment adjustment had had a downward effect on the growth of the  gross operating surplus.  Excluding the alignment adjustment,  the gross operating surplus of private non-financial corporations was flat, although the annual rate was little different (at around 5%). 25 The contribution from stockbuilding to GDP growth had been revised down from -0.2 percentage points to -0.4 percentage points.  But excluding erratic items, the contribution to GDP growth from stockbuilding was estimated to have been around -0.2 percentage points. 26 The Bank’s regional Agents had conducted a survey of their contacts about trends in stock-to-output ratios, both in the recent past and looking to the future.  The contacts had been from the manufacturing, retailing and wholesale sectors.  The Agents had asked how firms’ stock-to-output ratios had changed over the last five years.  The majority of respondents (56%) had reported falling ratios.  When the responses had been weighted according to firms’ turnover, the balance of those reporting rising and falling ratios had been more even.  A majority of retailers had reported a rise in stock-to-output ratios on this basis, while manufacturers had continued on balance to show a fall. 27 The Agents had also asked about the future trend of  stock-output ratios over the next few years—excluding cyclical influences.  A clear majority of respondents had expected their stock-output ratios to fall.  This result had been seen across all three sectors.  In the retailing sector, increased competition, pressure on profit margins and improvements in information technology had been seen as the drivers of the expected reduction in stock levels as a proportion of sales.  A majority of respondents had expected future falls in stock-output ratios to be similar to those in the past, with the exception of retailers. 28 The contribution of net trade to GDP growth had been revised down to -0.7 percentage points from -0.5 percentage points. This had reflected an upward revision to import growth, from 0.3% to 1.1%, which had more than offset the upward revision to export growth (from -1.4% to -1.0%).  The Q1 net trade deficit, at 4.5% of GDP, had been the second highest on record.  Inflation Report:  August 1999 82 29 Retail sales volumes had risen by 1.0% in May, following a revised fall of -0.3% in April.  The three month growth rate (on the previous three months) had risen from 0.6% to 1.1%.  The CBI Distributive Trades survey had suggested continued strength in June with the balance on reported sales at +22, up from +11 in May.  The GfK measure of consumer confidence had suggested robust spending growth in Q2;  the index had been broadly unchanged in June at 5.8. 30 Most indicators had suggested continuing strength in the housing market.  The Nationwide house price index had risen by 0.8% in June;  the Halifax index had risen by 1.8%.  The annual rates of the two indices had moved closer, at 7.5% and 6.6% respectively.  Housing starts had continued to rise from their trough in the autumn of 1998, and the House Builders’ Federation survey balance on net reservations had remained at a strong level despite a slight fall in May.  The improvement in starts was expected to feed through to higher completions and investment in dwellings over time.  Particulars delivered in the three months to May had risen by 3.5% compared with the previous three months, but were 5.4% up on a year earlier.  The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors’ survey had shown a rise in the number of sales per agent in May for the second consecutive month. 31 Construction output had risen by 0.2% in 1999 Q1 and had been broadly flat over the last three quarters.  The volume of orders for new work had been slightly weaker over the last two quarters, but was expected to underpin construction output in the short term. The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) construction survey had indicated rising optimism and orders:  the construction activity index had risen to 64.5 in June from 62.4. Within this, housing activity had risen faster than total construction, consistent with the pick-up in housing market indicators. 32 The outlook for manufacturing output had improved in June. The CIPS activity index had been above 50 for the third consecutive month.  The expected output balance from the CBI survey had been positive in June, for the second month running.  The CBI new orders balance had fallen slightly in June, with manufacturers citing the strong pound and weak European demand.  Industrial production had risen by 0.1% in May.  The CIPS services activity index had been broadly unchanged in June at 56.6.  The new business index, at 58.5, had been at its highest level since March 1998. IV The labour market 33 Employment growth, as measured by the Labour Force Survey (LFS), had slowed further in the three months to April compared with the previous three months, rising by 46,000 (0.2%). Workforce jobs had fallen by around 4,000 in Q1.  There had been an increasing divergence between the two employment measures over the past year.  During this period, LFS employment had risen by around 300,000 whereas Workforce jobs were only 85,000 higher.  The increase in LFS employment during February-April had been more than accounted for by a rise of 57,000 in full-time employment and, consequently, the slowdown in employment growth was less evident in full-time equivalent terms.  Higher employment had been offset by average hours per worker falling by 0.3% from the previous three months.  Total hours had therefore fallen slightly over the quarter (by 0.2%), but overall, had been broadly flat for a year. 34 Turning to survey information, the CIPS manufacturing survey for June showed that employment had fallen further during the month, though the rate of decline had slowed.  In the construction and service sectors employment had expanded further, and at slightly faster rates than they had in May.  The Manpower survey of employment prospects for Q3 had shown little change, with the service and public sectors weaker and the manufacturing sector stronger.  Information from the Bank’s regional Agents suggested that further manufacturing redundancies would be offset by job creation in services, especially in the hotel and transport sectors, where the Working Time Directive was having a significant impact. 35 Data problems persisted with the stock of unfilled vacancies in Northern Ireland and the West Midlands.  Notifications of vacancies had fallen by 15,700 in May, although the trend had been flat.  Overall, there had been no clear news in the vacancies data. 36 Both measures of unemployment had fallen.  LFS unemployment had fallen by 23,000 to 6.2% in February-April, while the claimant count had fallen by 6,500 in May with the  rate unchanged at 4.5%.  On both measures, unemployment  rates had changed little since mid-1998.  The latest fall in LFS unemployment had been mainly among the short-term unemployed. Long-term unemployment had been flat.  Changes in the regional pattern of unemployment had been consistent with the strong growth in service sector activity and the decline in manufacturing activity. 37 Inactivity had risen by 25,000 in the three months to April compared with the previous three months, which represented the first increase since mid-1998.  This increase had been driven by a rise of 50,000 in the number of people who did not want a job. 38 Annual headline earnings growth for the whole economy had fallen from 4.8% to 4.6% in April.  The fall in the headline rate was accounted for by private sector earnings growth, which had fallen by 0.4 percentage points.  Public sector earnings growth had risen by 0.1 percentage points.  The fall in private sector earnings growth had been particularly surprising given the introduction of the National Minimum Wage (NMW) in April, which had been expected to push up earnings growth.  However, it was possible that some firms may have anticipated its introduction and had raised wages before the introduction date.  The largest fall in earnings growth was in the services sector, where earnings had fallen  1.1 percentage points in the twelve months to April.  In manufacturing, on the other hand, annual earnings growth had increased by 0.2 percentage points.  The ONS had said that the fall in earnings growth was partly the result of a broadly based fall in bonuses in the business services sector, and partly the result of some firms paying their bonuses in Q1 rather than in April, as they had done last year.   39 Information from private surveys had suggested that earnings growth was either flat or had fallen slightly.  The Reward index had fallen from 3.9% in April to 3.6% in May.  The Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services survey on salaries and wage rates in June indicated that earnings growth was unchanged, although the survey was based on a small sample.  40 Wage settlements in May had changed little from the previous month.  The twelve-month mean for the whole economy had been unchanged at 3.8%.  The private sector mean had fallen by 0.1 percentage points to 3.7%, while the public sector mean had been unchanged at 4.1%.  In a matched sample, the mean private sector wage settlement in April had fallen by 0.6 percentage points from the same time last year, somewhat less than the fall in inflation expectations over the same period. 41 The annual growth rate in the ONS measure of labour productivity in Q1 had been the weakest since 1991, rising by only 0.5%.  A new productivity survey produced by NTC Research and the Institute of Management Services had suggested a sharp pick-up in productivity growth in Q2.  Growth in unit wage costs had risen again in Q1, as wages and salaries had grown faster than productivity. V Prices 42 The Bank’s index of commodity prices including oil had risen by 0.6% in May, following strong rises in March and April.  Monetary Policy Committee 83 The index excluding oil had also risen, by 0.2%.  But annual inflation in both indices had fallen:  to 3.4% (from 4.0%) for the oil-inclusive index and 1.4% (1.7%) excluding oil.  The oil price had risen slightly over the month and exceeded $18 per barrel on  6 July. 43 Producer input prices had fallen by 0.5% in May and the year-on-year inflation rate had fallen back to -2.6% from -1.1% in April.  Imported materials prices had continued to fall.  Evidence from the CIPS survey had suggested continued but slowing deflation in the near future.  The output price level, whether including or excluding excise duties, had been unchanged in May.  Total import prices had risen by 0.2% in April, but prices for imports from the non-EU countries had fallen by 0.1% in May.  Export prices had risen more sharply—by 0.7% to all countries in April and by 0.5% to non-EU countries in May. 44 The rate of GDP deflator inflation in the first quarter had been revised up by 0.1 percentage points on both a quarterly and annual basis (to 0.4% and 2.2% respectively) in the third release  of the GDP data.  The retail sales deflator fell for the third consecutive month in May, leading to negative annual inflation  for the first time in the series’ history.  The annual rate of inflation on the harmonised index had fallen by 0.2 percentage points to 1.3% in May, equalling its lowest rate since the series started in 1988. 45 The annual rate of RPIX inflation had fallen sharply, to 2.1%, in May.  The rates of RPIY and RPI inflation had also fallen to 1.5% and 1.3% respectively.  The fall was largely due to lower food and other goods prices, and had continued the recent pattern where goods price inflation had fallen but services inflation  had remained fairly constant.  Inflation in April and May had  been markedly weaker than the central projection in the May Inflation Report forecast.  This was entirely because of goods price inflation. VI Reports by the Bank’s Agents 46 The Bank’s regional Agents had reported on their general discussions with contacts.  The manufacturing recovery had been fragile, but business expectations had improved.  And whereas business and financial services had shown ongoing growth, the outlook for consumer services had remained weak. 47 Retail sales had stayed weak.  Only discount stores had recorded significant strengthening in activity.  Generally, discounting had continued to be widespread.  The evidence for other non-retail consumer expenditure had been mixed. 48 Exports to the United States had continued to be strong.  The East Asian market on the other hand remained depressed, though the outlook had improved.  Demand from Europe had remained weak, particularly from Germany and Italy.  Sterling’s persistent strength was seen as the main obstacle to rising European orders. 49 Manufacturing employment had fallen further, in contrast to the service sector where employment intentions had firmed.  Skill shortages and pay pressures had persisted.  50 Overall, the view had been that activity in Q2 had turned out stronger than in Q1, though the latter had been perceived as very weak. VII Market intelligence 51 Short-term expectations for UK interest rates had fallen since the previous MPC meeting.  For longer maturities, however, rates had risen by around 40 basis points, having been up by 70 basis points or so at one stage.  Changes in the shape of the yield curve could be partially attributed to international influences, such as the decision by the FOMC to raise rates, and to shifts in the market’s view on UK entry to EMU and hence the future path of UK rates. In the more immediate future most market participants did not expect a further cut in the repo rate this month, given the retail sales data, evidence from surveys and house price data, although some believed that it was possible in the next few months if inflation continued to be below expectations. 52 Sterling had, over the last month, continued to depreciate against the dollar, reaching its lowest level since September 1996, with talk that it had moved into a new trading range.  The changing pattern of differentials in official interest rates internationally was thought by many to be an important factor, as were signs of growth in other economies.  For these reasons corporate demand for sterling had been less apparent at these levels than before.  Data from options markets had suggested that the market saw risks as being on the downside for sterling against both the euro and the dollar.

2002-11-13,"Inflation Report November 2002 The Inflation Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff under the guidance of the members of the Monetary Policy Committee.  It serves two purposes.  First, its preparation provides a comprehensive and forward-looking framework for discussion among MPC members as an aid to our decision making.  Second, its publication allows us to share our thinking and explain the reasons for our decisions to those whom they affect. Although not every member will agree with every assumption on which our projections are based, the fan charts represent the MPC’s best collective judgment about the most likely paths for inflation and output, and the uncertainties surrounding those central projections. This Report has been prepared and published by the  Bank of England in accordance with section 1 8 of the  Bank of England Act 1 998. The Monetary Policy Committee: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy Andrew Large, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Christopher Allsopp Kate Barker Charles Bean Marian Bell Stephen Nickell Paul Tucker The Overview of this Inflation Report is available on the Bank’s web site at www.bankofengland.co.uk/inflationreport/infrep.htm  The entire Report is available in PDF at www.bankofengland.co.uk/inflationrep/index.html  i The global economic recovery remains patchy.  In the United States, output growth picked up in the third quarter, as consumers increased purchases of motor vehicles in response to generous financing deals.  But that stimulus is likely to prove temporary and a drop in consumer confidence suggests household spending could moderate.  The euro area has experienced below-par growth in output, with sluggish consumer spending and weak business investment holding back domestic demand.  Japan has seen a modest pick-up in activity, led by external demand, but prospects there remain subdued. However, strong domestic demand has ensured output growth has held up relatively well in a number of other Asian economies. Global equity prices fell sharply again during late summer, but regained most of that lost ground in October.  Notwithstanding the recent rise, equity indices stand well below their levels at the start of the year and there is considerable uncertainty about the impact of that correction on future consumer spending and investment.  The Federal Reserve has cut official interest rates by 0.5 percentage points, while official rates have remained unchanged in the other major economies.  In the face of the continued accommodative monetary stance, market interest rates have softened and that will help to counteract any weakness in global activity.  The Committee continues to expect UK-weighted world demand to strengthen gradually.  But although prospects are broadly the same as in the August Inflation Report, there are significant risks to the outlook. In the United Kingdom, GDP is provisionally estimated to have risen by 0.7% in Q3, slightly up on the second-quarter growth rate, although the impact of the Jubilee holidays has masked the The recovery in the world economy remains fragile and global stock markets have continued to be volatile. In the United Kingdom, quarterly output growth has picked up to around trend.  The consumer continues to be the primary engine of growth in demand.  That has been associated with rapid house price inflation and accelerating household borrowing.  The Committee’s central projection at the current level of official interest rates is for four-quarter GDP growth to settle at around trend over the next two years.  Pay pressures remain subdued.  Annual RPIX inflation averaged 2.0% in the third quarter.  It is projected to move above the 2.5% target in the near term, dip slightly below it towards the end of next year, and then edge back up towards target as the two-year horizon approaches.  Significant risks to the outlook for growth and inflation remain. Overview  Inflation Report: November 2002 ii underlying trends in some of the constituent series.  So while output in the manufacturing sector expanded by over 1% in the third quarter, the underlying trend since Q1 appears to have been broadly flat.  The Jubilee effects were probably rather less significant for the services sector, which grew by 0.8% in Q3. Taking the second and third quarters together, the underlying picture is one of around-trend output growth. The growth in consumers’ expenditure picked up sharply to 1.3% in the second quarter, though some of that may reflect the timing of Easter.  More muted growth is likely to have occurred in Q3, but record levels of consumers’ confidence in their own financial position and rapid growth in borrowing suggest that the outlook is for spending to remain strong in the near term. The resilience of consumer spending in recent quarters has been associated with a rise in annual house price inflation to around 25%–30%.  That has allowed owner-occupiers to increase their secured borrowing, thus supporting consumer demand and offsetting the impact of lower equity prices.  But recent rates of house price inflation are unsustainable. Together with slowing growth in real disposable incomes and lower equity wealth, slower house price inflation would act to dampen future spending growth. Underlying government spending has been rising strongly, though recent quarterly movements have been erratic. Government consumption in Q2 was 4.6% up on a year earlier, while capital spending was almost 12% higher.  Continued strong growth in public expenditure is planned for the next two years. Business investment was little changed in Q2, but around 1 1% lower than a year earlier after especially sharp falls around the turn of last year.  Sufficient capacity, weak profitability, pressures on corporate balance sheets and subdued investment intentions all point to a sluggish near-term outlook for capital spending.  Destocking reduced second-quarter growth, but that may have been partly related to the Jubilee and some reversal is likely to have happened in Q3. Net exports boosted growth in the second quarter, but recent movements in exports and imports have been erratic and trade data point to a return to a negative contribution in Q3.  In every year since 1 996, net exports have detracted from growth, though improved terms of trade have limited the impact on the current account deficit. Chart 1 shows the MPC’s assessment of the outlook for GDP growth, on the benchmark assumption that the official interest rate remains at 4.0%.  Under the central projection, robust consumer demand pushes four-quarter GDP growth up to a  Overview iii little above trend early next year.  Growth then settles back, as a deceleration of household spending offsets a recovery in external demand, higher public expenditure and a modest  pick-up in business investment.  The profile for output growth is broadly similar to that shown in the August Report. Among other factors, inflationary pressure depends upon the balance of demand relative to supply in labour and product markets.  The employment rate has changed little through the slowdown, as job losses in manufacturing have been offset by increased recruitment in the public sector and construction, though some easing in underlying labour demand is suggested by the decline in total hours worked.  In the three months to August, the ILO unemployment rate was 5.2%, just  0.3 percentage points above its May 2001 trough.  Along with other indicators, that suggests only a slight easing in labour market tightness.  Headline earnings growth has been running at a little under 4% since May, but may soon edge up as the delayed local authority pay settlement takes effect. Growth in productivity per head had been unusually weak during the slowdown—though productivity per hour held up better—but the growth of unit wage costs has eased as output growth has picked up.  Concerns about the possibility of military action in Iraq produced a spike in oil prices, and increases over the course of this year are now working through into input costs.  While there are significant differences across sectors, survey measures and other indicators suggest that capacity utilisation is, on average, a little below normal.  RPIX inflation ticked up to 2.0% in Q3, though monthly movements remain volatile.  The marked divergence between goods and services price inflation has persisted, reflecting sectoral differences in market conditions as well as in productivity growth. Chart 2 shows the Committee’s assessment of the outlook for RPIX inflation.  In the central projection, inflation rises above the 2.5% target by the end of this year reflecting the impact of higher oil prices and an unusually high contribution from housing depreciation.  It remains at that higher level for most  of next year, and then drops a little below target as those influences unwind, subsequently edging back up as the two-year horizon approaches.  Compared with the August Report, the profile is rather higher in the first year and slightly lower during the second year. Among the many uncertainties surrounding these projections, the Committee identified a number of particular risks.  First, that US consumer spending might falter and the euro area remain sluggish, thus threatening the global recovery.  Second, that the exceptional rate of house price inflation might Chart 2 Current RPIX inflation projection based  on constant nominal interest rates at 4% 0 1 2 3 4 5 Percentage increase in prices on a year earlier 2.5 1998 99 2000 01 02 03 04 The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for RPIX inflation in the future.

Inflation Report: November 2002 iv continue for a while yet, leading ultimately to a more abrupt slowdown in both house price inflation and consumer spending growth.  Third, that the pass-through into wages and prices of the increase in National Insurance contributions next spring might be greater than in the central projection.  The crystallisation of any of these risks could have material implications for the prospects for growth and inflation, and thus for policy.  But, overall, the Committee judges that, relative to the central projection, the balance of risks to growth is weighted somewhat to the downside, with those to inflation slightly on the upside. At its November meeting, the Committee noted that, although uneven, the profile for inflation under the central projection remained close to target over the forecast period.  Bearing in mind the substantial risks, the Committee judged that it was at present appropriate to leave official interest rates at 4%.  But the Committee observed that prompt action might be required if any of those risks appeared to be crystallising.

In the period between 3 1 July and 6 November, the price of a broad basket of UK equities varied by almost 20%—the FTSE All-Share index reached a peak of 2 1 47 in late August, and a low of 1783 in late September.  For most of the time, other major equity price indices followed paths similar to that of the FTSE All-Share, which suggests that some of the factors driving equity markets were global in nature (see Chart 1.1).  Equity price movements have been large in comparison to news about some of the factors that ought to be driving them—for example, expectations of corporate earnings growth over the medium term have changed little in recent months.  This, together with high measures of implied volatility as derived from options prices, suggests that market participants have been very uncertain about the valuation to place on equities.  The average of the FTSE All-Share index in the 1 5 working days up until 6 November was 1 955, close to its average of 1 985 in the 1 5 working days up until 3 1 July.  The starting point for the equity price projection contained in this Report is a little below the starting point used in August. Although the overall change in UK equity prices during the past three months has been small, by 6 November, when data for this Report were finalised, the FTSE All-Share index had fallen more than 20% since the beginning of the year, and was 40% below its value at the end of 1 999.  Chart 1.2 shows how Global equity prices rose a little following publication of the August Inflation Report, but then fell sharply during September.  Most indices have now recovered to stand at levels close to those seen three months previously.  There have also been large fluctuations in the prices of government bonds, with equity prices and bond yields tracking each other closely. Some early indicators point to a possible slowdown in housing market activity.  But this has not yet fed through to weaker house price inflation—the annual rate in October looks to have been somewhere in the range 25%–30%.  Household borrowing has accelerated.  In Q2, less than half the total amount of secured borrowing was invested in the housing stock.  It is likely that most of the remainder was used to fund additional consumption.

Inflation Report: November 2002 4 UK equity prices have changed, in real terms, since 1 91 5. Although dominated by the collapse in real equity prices during 1 973 and 1 97 4, the recent decline has been large by post-war standards.  And it unwound much of the real increase that had occurred between January 1 992 and December 1 999. Monetary policy On 7 November, the MPC maintained the Bank of England repo rate at 4%.  This two-week official interest rate has now been left unchanged for a year.  On 6 November, the  US Federal Open Market Committee reduced its target for the federal funds rate by 0.5 percentage points to 1.25%.  Official interest rates in the euro area have remained unchanged since the August Report. Policy-makers have an interest in knowing what financial market participants expect will happen to the official rate of interest.  These expectations affect the terms on which individuals can both lend and borrow money.  Moreover, when policy-makers are informed about what people expect them to do, it can help them to judge whether the actual policy decision will be a surprise, and hence what influence it might have on other financial market prices, and on the economy. Each day, Bank staff estimate two nominal forward interest rate curves—known as the government liability curve and the commercial bank liability (CBL) curve—from which information about financial market expectations can be obtained.(1) But this is not a straightforward exercise. The government liability curve is based on a combination of general collateral (GC) repo rates with a maturity of up to six months, and gilt yields.(2) Interest rates implied by the government liability curve are often thought to approximate risk-free interest rates.  The commercial bank liability curve is fitted through a sequence of rates at which commercial banks lend money to each other on an unsecured basis, known as London Interbank Offer Rates (or Libor), and a number of derivative instruments that settle against Libor.  In the period since the August Inflation Report, both curves have shifted down and to the right (see Chart 1.3).  One interpretation is that, by 6 November, financial market participants believed that the timing of an official interest rate rise had been further delayed. The government liability curve, as derived, can be an imperfect measure of expectations about the official two-week repo rate, if the yields on particular gilts are affected by fluctuations in Chart 1.3 Two-week forward interest rates(a) 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0 July 2002 Jan.  03 July  Jan. 04 July  Per cent CBL 31 July (b) CBL 6 Nov.

(a) Equity prices are measured at the end of each month and deflated by an RPI series that has been seasonally adjusted by the Bank.   The chart ends in September 2002, which is the final data point for the RPI. (1) The government liability curve has previously been referred to in the Inflation Report as the GC repo/gilt curve.  Estimates of both the government liability curve and the commercial bank liability curve are published daily on the Bank of England web site at www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/yieldcurve/main.htm (2) A GC repo rate is the rate that one financial institution pays to borrow money from another when it effectively offers any gilt as security against the risk of default.

Interest rates implied by the commercial bank liability curve incorporate a time-varying credit risk premium, to compensate for the risk of default on unsecured loans to private sector organisations.  In addition, both curves are affected by term premia, which tend to widen the gap between the implied forward rate and the expected policy rate at longer maturities. Each curve can give misleading signals about market expectations of official rates from time to time, but the large movements down and to the right shown in Chart 1.3 are likely to be significant nonetheless. In the week before each regular monthly meeting of the MPC, Reuters conducts a survey of economists working in the financial sector.  Such surveys, though less timely than information obtained from financial market prices, are still helpful because they provide a direct measure of expectations. In the most recent survey, published on 3 1 October, 1 8 of the 32 respondents expected that the Bank of England repo rate would be left unchanged at the meeting on 6 and 7 November. The average expected rate for the end of 2002, at 3.87%, was a little below the current repo rate.  The rate expected for the end of 2003 was 4.45%.  These forecasts were both around half a percentage point lower than the equivalent forecasts published on 25 July.  All of the available evidence suggests that expectations of the two-week Bank of England repo rate during the next twelve months or so, have fallen since the August Report.  Survey-based measures of inflation expectations have tended to fall too (see Section 4), though by a smaller amount, so the short-term real rate of interest has probably fallen. Government bond yields The Government liability curve, and a real forward interest rate curve derived from index-linked gilt yields, provide measures of the implied rates, both nominal and real, at which financial markets would be willing to lend to the UK government at different points of time in the future.  The rates at which households and firms can borrow money will be related to these forward interest rates, but will generally be higher. Chart 1.4 shows that, by 6 November, nominal forward interest rates had fallen by around 0.2 percentage points at maturities up to five years, but were broadly unchanged further out.  There had been little movement in real forward interest rates. Just as equity prices have varied substantially during the past three months, so too have gilt yields, with the ten-year nominal Chart 1.4 Nominal and real forward rate curves(a) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 5 10 15 20 25 Nominal 31 July Nominal 6 Nov.

Inflation Report: November 2002 6 yield reaching a high of 4.8% and a low of 4.4%.  Chart 1.5 shows how UK equity prices have moved closely in line with gilt yields since May, with both tending to fall.  This pattern is consistent with an increase in equity risk resulting from greater uncertainty about equity returns.  If investors started to demand less risky assets, such as gilts, that would lead to a rise in their price and a fall in their yield.  News about growth prospects might also produce the kind of relationship apparent in Chart 1.5, with a weaker economic outlook leading to expectations that dividend payments would be lower and monetary policy looser. Exchange rates With the exception of the Japanese yen, effective exchange rate indices for most major currencies have been broadly stable since the August Report (see Chart 1.6).  This is also consistent with the view that the major events driving financial markets have been international in nature.  The amount of uncertainty surrounding the position in twelve months’ time of the sterling/US dollar, and particularly the sterling/euro bilateral exchange rates, as measured by implied volatilities, has declined since the beginning of the year (see Chart 1.7). Property prices When preparing the projections published in the August Inflation Report, the Committee judged that house price inflation would slow markedly over the next two years, to reach a level a little below the growth rate of nominal earnings.  Are there any signs that a slowdown in the housing market has begun? The diagram opposite, based on a survey conducted on behalf of the former Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR), depicts the approximate timing of events that led up to a typical house purchase in 1 998.(1) According to the survey, the median time interval between deciding to look for a property and completing the transaction was then around five months.  The median time interval between securing a mortgage approval and completing the transaction was five to six weeks. Table 1.A lists some measures of housing market activity.  Some of the early indicators in the chain began to slow down in the third quarter.  In particular, the balance of respondents to the House Builders Federation survey reporting more net reservations was lower in July and August than during the first half of the year.  Although there was some rebound in the September figure, it remained below the averages for Q1 and Q2.  There was a small reduction in the number of loan approvals in Q3.

Money and asset prices 7 Because lenders record house prices at the mortgage approval stage, one might expect to see an approximately contemporaneous relationship between housing market activity, as measured by the number of approvals, and the  rate of change of house prices.  But monthly house price inflation can be quite erratic.  It declined, on the Halifax measure, from 1.8% in July to 0.2% in August, only to rise again to 4.4% in September, and 4.7% in October—the strongest one-month increase since the data were first collected in 1 983 (see Chart 1.8).  Consequently, economic commentators tend to focus on annual measures.  Chart 1.9 shows that mortgage approvals have tended to lead annual house price inflation. Putting together data from both the Halifax and the Nationwide, house price inflation in the year to October appears to have been somewhere in the range 25%–30%.

Inflation Report: November 2002 8 the time of the August Report, and is clearly unsustainable. By region, house price inflation in London and the South East has recently been a little below the national average.  In  the year to Q3 the most rapid house price increases  occurred in the Midlands, followed by the South West and  East Anglia (see Chart 1.10).  In light of the tentative signs  of an easing in housing market activity, the Committee continues to anticipate that house price inflation will soon begin to slow. According to the Investment Property Databank, the capital value of commercial property rose by just 2.0% in the year to September.  Commercial property prices have risen much more slowly than residential property prices for the past  two years, reflecting the relative weakness of the corporate sector. 1.2 Money and credit(1) Monetary aggregates The rates of growth of seasonally adjusted notes and coin and M0 have been quite volatile in recent months, largely reflecting unusual patterns of economic activity associated with the timing of Easter and the Jubilee celebrations  (see Section 2).  In the year to 2002 Q2, the stock of M0 rose by 9.5% (see Table 1.B).  At the same time, nominal household expenditure increased by just 4.7%.  The box on page 9 of this Report suggests that M0 could continue to grow more quickly than consumption for some time to come. Aggregate M4, the sum of notes and coin and sterling deposits with UK banks and building societies held by households, private non-financial corporations (PNFCs) and other financial corporations (OFCs), rose by 5.4% in the year to 2002 Q3 (see Table 1.B).  Its major counterpart, M4 lending (excluding the effects of securitisations), which measures sterling lending by UK banks and building societies to those same three sectors, rose by 9.6% during the same period.  The growth rates of these two aggregates have been declining for the past two years or so.  However, much of the decline can be accounted for by the OFCs sector.  Changes in OFCs’ money and credit are thought to have fewer direct implications for nominal demand than those of households and non-financial corporations.  Excluding the OFCs component, growth in M4 and M4 lending has been steadier in the recent past (see Chart 1.1 1).

Money and asset prices 9 Developments in the velocity of narrow money  During the past two years, the annual rate of growth of M0 has averaged 8.0%.  By contrast, the annual rate of growth of nominal consumption has averaged just 5.0%.  Should policy-makers be concerned by this rapid growth in the quantity of narrow money?  Does it signal that inflation will soon pick up, or perhaps that consumption is being underrecorded?  Not necessarily—the relationship between economic activity and M0 is complicated by changes in interest rates and the associated process of financial innovation. Chart A compares the velocity of circulation of narrow money, defined here as the ratio of nominal consumption per annum to M0, with a nominal interest rate.  The nominal interest rate is a measure of the opportunity cost of holding cash.  It measures the cost of the interest foregone (represented here by the return on eligible bills) when an individual chooses to hold cash in preference to other forms of wealth.  When the opportunity cost of holding cash is high, then other things equal, narrow money holdings should be low relative to consumption—in other words velocity should be high. For most of the period since 1 870 the two series have moved together.  During the early part of the 1 970s, the nominal interest rate began to rise sharply, reaching a peak of 17 .4% in 1 980 Q1.  This unprecedented increase in the opportunity cost of holding narrow money may have contributed to the development of cash-saving innovations, such as the introduction of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), encouraged payment of salaries by cheque, or by direct money transfer, and promoted the introduction of credit and debit cards.  These innovations were associated with a significant upward shift in velocity. But since the early 1 990s, interest rates have fallen precipitously.  Chart A suggests the puzzle is not the current strength of M0 growth, but rather its weakness.  Why has M0 not grown more quickly to bring velocity back into line with the low levels seen before the high inflation/high nominal interest rate era of the 1 970s and 1 980s?  Part of the explanation is perhaps that people have grown accustomed to holding less cash, and that the technology enabling them to do this, while expensive to set up, is relatively cheap to maintain. It can be instructive to look at narrow money velocity trends in other countries.  Nominal interest rates also rose sharply during the early part of the 1 970s in the United States and Canada, but these countries did not experience, to the same degree, a second period of high nominal interest rates at the end of the 1 980s.  In the United States, narrow money velocity has now returned to pre-1 970s’ levels (see Chart B). However, this series may have been distorted by the increasing use of dollar bills outside the United States.  In Canada, narrow money velocity began to decline around ten years after the peak in nominal interest rates.  Although it has not yet returned to pre-1 970s’ levels, it has fallen further than in the United Kingdom (see Chart C).  Given the current low rates of interest, and the experience of other low nominal interest rate economies, it seems plausible that M0 could continue to grow in excess of nominal consumption for some time to come, without necessarily jeopardising the inflation target.

(a) Average duration is calculated as the outstanding stock of credit  card debt divided by the monthly flow of repayments.  The series is  presented as a three-month moving average. Households Households’ M4 deposit growth has remained firm.  Annual growth in Q3, at 8.1%, was close to rates seen for the past year or so.  Growth in lending to individuals continued to strengthen.  Total lending to individuals, which measures lending by a broader set of institutions than just banks and building societies, rose by 1 3.1% in the year to Q3, the fastest rate of growth since 1 990.  Lending secured on dwellings grew by 12.4% while the remainder, which includes credit card and store card lending, as well as personal loans and overdrafts, grew by 1 5.8%. House price rises boost secured lending through two separate channels.  First, for a given loan-to-value ratio, first-time buyers will require larger mortgages than before.  Second, existing homeowners will see an improvement in their net housing wealth, giving them the scope to undertake further secured borrowing at lower rates than on unsecured debt.  Of the £1 8.6 billion net secured borrowing by individuals in Q2, it is estimated that £10.6 billion, or more than half, was not invested in the housing stock.  It is likely that some of this £10.6 billion, known as mortgage equity withdrawal (MEW), was used to purchase financial assets, and some used to repay existing unsecured debt.  But a further portion will have been used to fund additional consumption.  Chart 1.12 shows how, in recent years, the fraction of net housing wealth that is withdrawn each quarter, has varied closely with the quantity of net housing wealth.  A box on pages 12–1 3 of this Report examines the relationship between changes in house prices and consumption in different countries. Credit cards have become an increasingly popular source of finance.  Their share in the flow of total unsecured lending to individuals rose from around 30% in the mid-1 990s to around 40% so far this year.  It is sometimes argued that the rapid growth in credit card debt reflects their greater acceptance as a means of payment.  But this seems to be only part of the story.  Since the mid-1 990s, the average time taken to repay credit card debt has increased from a little over three months to nearly five months (see Chart 1.1 3).  People have come to rely increasingly on credit cards as a means to borrow money for a period of time, and not just as a convenient alternative to using cash or a cheque.  This may be because, over the past few years, the effective interest rate on credit card debt has fallen by more than the equivalent rate on personal loans or overdrafts (see Table 1.C). The ratio of household sector liabilities to annualised household sector income reached a new record high in  2002 Q2 (see top panel of Chart 1.1 4).  But household sector liabilities are dwarfed by household sector assets.

Money and asset prices 11 housing is excluded, and even after sharp falls in equity prices, household sector financial assets are still worth more than three times as much as household sector liabilities (see bottom panel of Chart 1.1 4). Of course, the fact that the household sector has far more assets than liabilities is not necessarily cause for comfort. First, the capital value of the majority of household assets, such as equity and housing, is uncertain.  The sums of money owed to banks, building societies and other lenders vary by comparatively little from quarter to quarter.  This is evident from the chart.  Second, when thinking about the risks to consumption from an excessive build-up of household debt, the distribution and type of assets and liabilities held by individual households matters, as well as the financial balance sheet of the sector as a whole. The British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), conducted in 2000, records the responses of more than 5,000 households to questions about the nature of their assets and liabilities. The survey showed that people with significant liabilities also tended to own valuable assets.  The correlation between the total liabilities and the total assets of individual households was 0.39.  This positive correlation is not surprising—people with large mortgages also tend to own expensive houses.  But housing and similarly illiquid assets may be difficult to realise at short notice.  In evaluating the potential vulnerability of households, it may make better sense to compare total liabilities with liquid assets. Chart 1.1 5 shows the distribution of total liabilities and liquid assets across a randomly chosen 10% sample of the BHPS for the year 2000.(1) A large number of respondents were positioned on at least one of the axes:  40% had no liabilities and 33% no liquid assets.  The correlation between the liabilities and the liquid assets of individual households was just 0.01.  In the event that house prices were to fall, or unemployment were to rise, then the observed distribution of total liabilities and liquid assets across households might indicate that the financial position of the household sector would be less resilient than suggested by the aggregate balance sheet data. Private non-financial corporations The rate of growth of PNFCs’ M4 deposits picked up from 4.4% in the year to Q2 to 6.1% in the year to Q3.

Inflation Report: November 2002 12 International housing-market developments Movements in equity markets and housing markets reflect underlying shocks to the economy, and are themselves important influences on economic activity and thus inflation.  The sharp gains and subsequent falls in real equity prices(1) over the past few years have been highly synchronised across most industrialised countries (see Chart A).  In contrast, movements in real house prices have been less uniform across countries (see Chart B), so they may have supported activity in some countries and weakened it in others. Looking across countries, changes in house prices are typically associated with changes in household consumption (see Chart C).  Consumer confidence and income expectations will determine households’ desired consumption of both housing and other goods and services.  To the extent that the supply of housing is not perfectly elastic in the short run, higher housing demand will be translated into higher prices.  So consumption and house prices can be correlated because they share a common cause. A rise in house prices may also stimulate an increase in consumption.  Owner-occupiers both own and consume the housing services provided by their dwellings, so a change in the price of a claim to this flow (ie a change in house prices) will not have the same effect as a change in the value of other wealth, such as shares.  But an increase in house prices may facilitate cheaper borrowing, as housing wealth may be offered as collateral for loans.  This will make it easier for households to bring forward consumption of future income, and also to smooth consumption against temporary shocks to income flows.  So higher house prices may encourage higher consumption in the short run as well.   The strength of this ‘collateral effect’ will depend on how easy it is to extract housing equity for consumption (mortgage equity withdrawal).  This has changed over time, varies widely across countries, and depends on the institutional and regulatory characteristics of mortgage finance institutions.  In countries such as the United Kingdom where it is relatively cheap and easy to extract housing equity, rising house prices may be providing support for consumption, and thus mitigating the negative effects of the recent stock market falls.

In some areas, an increase in the demand for housing, due to an increase in incomes, population or credit availability, will lead to the construction of new houses.  In other areas, where either land availability or planning constraints inhibit increased supply,the price of houses must rise to bring demand back in line with the fixed supply. Evidence from the United States(2) suggests that the price of housing is close to marginal costs of construction in most areas, with land constituting a small share of total costs.  Where land availability or planning restrictions prevent additional supply of similar dwellings, house prices are far above physical replacement cost. To the extent that the supply of land with planning approval, relative to the demand for it, varies across countries, the long-run response of national average house prices to an increase in housing demand will differ.  In countries and regions where land availability and planning regulations facilitate new construction, real house prices will rise in line with construction costs in the long run.  Where new construction is in some manner constrained, real house prices may rise faster, as rising real incomes bid up the price of the scarce factor (land with planning permission).  Long-term trends in house prices indeed vary widely across countries (see Charts D and E) as well as across regions, although problems of quality adjustment make international comparisons only tentative, and the low frequency of the cycles make it difficult to assess the trend.

Nevertheless, it remains at a historically high level.  Capital gearing at market value rose sharply in Q2, reflecting the fall in equity markets (see Chart 1.1 6).

US GDP grew by 0.3% in Q2, compared with 1.2% in Q1.   The advance estimate for Q3 was 0.8%.  Growth in the euro area in Q2 was 0.4%, unchanged from Q1.  Japanese GDP  rose by 0.6% in Q2, following a revised figure of no growth in Q1. Euro area Growth in the euro area reached a trough in 2001 Q4, but the subsequent pick-up has been modest, reflecting prolonged weakness in consumption and investment (see Table 2.B).  The falls in equity prices since 2000 have dampened consumption growth in the major economies.  But consumer spending in the euro area has weakened more sharply than in the United Kingdom and the United States (see Chart 2.1).  And it seems unlikely that the predominant cause of weak euro-area consumption has been the decline in equity wealth. Households’ direct share ownership remains less widespread and the ratio of equity market capitalisation to GDP is lower than in the United Kingdom and the United States.(1) So although equity prices fell further in the euro area, they probably had a smaller impact on consumption.  Moreover, these equity price falls cannot have been the initial cause of the consumption slowdown, as that started in early 1 999, when stock prices were still rising rapidly.  By contrast, the start of Economic growth in the major overseas economies slowed in the second quarter, in line with the MPC’s assessment in the August Report.  Net trade made a large positive contribution to UK GDP growth in Q2, compared with a mostly negative contribution during the past six years.  Private investment has remained weak, with little sign of an imminent turnaround.  Consumer spending was strong in the second quarter and confidence remains high.  However, recent UK data have been affected by the timing of Easter and the Jubilee Bank Holidays, which have obscured the underlying trends.  The unravelling of these effects is likely to depress consumption growth temporarily in Q3.  But relatively robust consumption growth is expected in the following six months.

Inflation Report: November 2002 16 the US and UK consumption slowdown coincided more closely with the peaks in their respective equity markets. Which other factors could account for the weakness of consumption in the euro area?  In answering this question it may help to focus on recent developments in Germany. Although consumption growth has slowed in the main  euro-area economies, it has been particularly weak in Germany, where the level of consumer spending actually contracted between 2001 Q3 and 2002 Q1.   Households are typically assumed to consider consumption and saving decisions in the light of expectations of income over the longer term (or ‘permanent’ income), rather than simply their income in the current period, which may be prone to short-term fluctuations.  Nevertheless, consumption might still move in line with current income if this was thought to contain news about future income, or if households were unable to borrow or liquidate assets to fund consumption when income was temporarily low.   German consumer spending appears to follow real household disposable income more closely than in other countries (see Chart 2.2).  So the weakness in German household income (which has, on average, grown in real terms by less than half that in France and the United States since 1 999) has probably been a key factor behind the consumption downturn there. Energy and food price increases, as well as the depreciation of the euro against other major currencies, may have depressed German real incomes in 2000 and 2001.  In 2002, the continued rise in unemployment may have further weakened them.  And perceptions of price increases resulting from the changeover to euro notes and coins in January may have encouraged households to believe that their real incomes had fallen by more than they actually have (see Chart 2.3), possibly also putting some downward pressure on their spending. Not all consumption in Germany has been financed out of current income.  When bank lending to households grew quickly in Germany during 1 999, consumption growth peaked and exceeded income growth.  But households’ bank borrowing has slowed in Germany since end-1 999 (and also, although less so, in the whole euro area), whereas it remained robust in the United States and rose vigorously in the United Kingdom (see Chart 2.4).  Some of the slowdown in German households’ bank borrowing may have reflected a downward adjustment of their long-term income prospects.  Falling house prices may also have been a cause of the weak borrowing. House prices in Germany have fallen in real and nominal terms over the past decade, in contrast to the rises in the Chart 2.2 Consumption and real household  disposable income 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 1991 93 95 97 99 2001 Percentage changes on a quarter earlier Consumption Real disposable income + _ Germany Source:  Thomson Financial Datastream. 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 1991 93 95 97 99 2001 United States Percentage changes on a quarter earlier Consumption Real disposable income + _ 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 1991 93 95 97 99 2001 France Percentage changes on a quarter earlier Real disposable income Consumption + _ Chart 2.3 Actual and perceived inflation in Germany 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 1991 93 95 97 99 2001 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Balance Percentage change on a year earlier Perceived (b) Actual (a) _ + + _ (left-hand scale) (right-hand scale) Sources:  European Commission and Thomson Financial Datastream.

To some extent, the decline in German house prices may have been related to excess supply, resulting from subsidies for construction investment in the early 1 990s.  Borrowing secured against the value of their home enables households to raise finance more cheaply than at unsecured rates.  So part of the fall in credit and hence consumption growth in Germany may be explained by weakness in the housing market reducing the value of households’ collateral.   Euro-area retail sales increased by 0.4% in the three months to August compared with the previous three months, suggesting somewhat faster consumption growth in Q3.  But, looking further ahead, consumer confidence data for October suggested that consumers have become more pessimistic about the outlook for the economy as a whole and their own financial situation during the next twelve months. Investment in the euro area continued to fall in Q2 and was 2.7% lower than a year earlier.  This was mainly accounted for by a 6.4% annual fall in German investment (see Chart 2.5). German investment has been falling since 2000 Q4, largely as a result of a decline in construction investment (which represents around 50% of the total) following the  post-reunification boom.  But reconstruction work following the floods in August may provide some temporary stimulus to investment in the near future. Partly reflecting flood-related disruptions, the recovery in euro-area industrial production remained weak in Q3. Although production was higher than its November 2001 trough, it was still down on levels of a year ago.  Industrial activity in the euro area, as measured by the Reuters manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (a weighted average of the survey balances for new orders, output, employment, suppliers’ delivery times and the stock of items purchased), rose to 49.1 in October, still below the 50 ‘no change’ level.   The Committee continues to expect a small pick-up in  euro-area GDP growth early next year.  But the recovery is likely to be slightly more subdued than was expected at the time of the August Report. United States US GDP increased by 0.3% in Q2, compared with unusually fast growth of 1.2% in Q1, which was partly due to a large contribution from inventories (see Table 2.C).  The Q2 slowdown reflected lower contributions from all components.

Inflation Report: November 2002 18 The advance estimate showed that growth picked up to 0.8% in the third quarter, reflecting a rise in consumption growth. The latter was largely accounted for by strong new auto  sales in July and August.  The widespread availability of  zero-per cent finance deals on new auto purchases reduced the average interest rate on auto loans (see Chart 2.6) and may, in part, have brought forward future spending on autos. But data for September suggest a fall-back in new auto sales as incentives have been withdrawn.  The strength of the US housing market has helped to underpin consumer spending by encouraging increased mortgage refinancing.  But refinancing has begun to fall back recently.  And consumers appear to have become more gloomy about the future.  Consumer confidence fell sharply on both the University of Michigan and Conference Board measures in October.   The preliminary estimate suggested that US fixed investment rose by 0.1% in Q3, following seven consecutive quarters of decline.  But spare capacity, high corporate debt levels, weakening credit flows, credit-rating downgrades, wider credit spreads and lower equity prices suggest that recovery will be sluggish. US industrial production fell in August and September, following seven months of growth.  But the longer-term profile continued to show a gradual recovery.  In its central projection, the Committee expects US GDP growth to ease back in the fourth quarter, with a slowdown in consumer spending.  Thereafter, growth should strengthen gradually, underpinned by continued improvements in productivity and the low level of interest rates. Asia Japanese GDP grew by 0.6% in Q2.  GDP growth in Q1 was revised to 0.0%, from 1.4% in the original release, reflecting the adoption by the Japanese authorities in August of a new method for calculating GDP .  The recovery in Japan in  2002 Q2 was largely driven by a strong contribution from net trade, and in particular a sharp rise in exports to other  Asian economies.  Investment was the only component to  make a negative contribution to GDP growth.  In recent months, industrial production growth has picked up significantly, though output fell in September.  But despite these signs of recovery, there is little change to the Committee’s view that the prospects for Japan remain weak in the near term. GDP in other Asian countries continued to grow rapidly in the second quarter, reflecting the strength of domestic demand.

The region accounts for around 6% of UK exports, and for around 17% of international trade (see Table 2.D).  So the strength of demand in the region may stimulate world activity and UK growth. Net trade Economic activity overseas affects UK growth via its contribution to net trade.  In Q2, UK export volumes rose at a faster rate than import volumes, although both may have been affected by the Jubilee Bank Holidays.  The net trade contribution to GDP growth rose to 0.9 percentage points, compared with a negative contribution of 0.6 percentage points in Q1.  But the Q2 fall in the terms of trade (the ratio of export to import prices) led to a slight increase in the current account deficit to 1.6% of GDP .  The current account has been in deficit for most of the period since 1 986 (see Chart 2.7). Developments in trade volumes and prices in Q2 were unusual relative to trends over recent years.  During the past six years, import growth has outstripped that of exports almost continuously, so net trade has detracted from UK growth.  But the impact on the current account has been mitigated by a steady improvement in the terms of trade (see Chart 2.8).   In the three months to August, goods export volumes fell by more than goods import volumes, compared with the previous three months, suggesting that net trade will make a negative contribution to Q3 GDP growth.  Survey measures of export orders weakened in Q3 (see Table 2.E). 2.2 Domestic demand Growth of real final domestic demand in the United Kingdom slowed to 0.3% in 2002 Q2 (see Table 2.F).  Consumer spending grew strongly after a subdued first quarter, but government consumption fell back sharply following a very marked increase in Q1.  Quarterly growth of domestic demand in the second quarter was the weakest since 1 995, in part because of a significant negative contribution from inventories.  However, recent data may not be a good guide to underlying trends because of the impact of the timing of Easter and the two Jubilee Bank Holidays.   Consumption Consumer spending rebounded in 2002 Q2, to grow at its fastest quarterly rate since early 2000 (see Chart 2.9), following a muted first quarter which saw the slowest growth since 1 997 .  Nevertheless, the four-quarter growth rate has been consistently above 3% since 1 995.

A reading above 50 suggests expansion;  below 50 suggests contraction.  Inflation Report: November 2002 20 below, the effects of the timing of Easter and the Jubilee Bank Holidays mean that quarterly consumption growth is expected to fall back sharply in Q3.  If it does so, the average growth rate over the first three quarters of 2002 might be somewhat lower than for any comparable period over the previous few years, though still above the long-run trend rate. Recent Reports have highlighted the extent to which durable goods, and especially vehicles, have underpinned the strength of consumption.  But the latest data contain indications that spending on durables may be weakening.(1) The contribution to consumption growth in 2002 Q2 from durable goods other than vehicles was the lowest for nearly five years.  A substantial factor in this weak performance was a 9.5% fall in purchases of major household appliances—the weakest quarterly growth in this component for nearly ten years.  However, this fall in spending on major household goods sits uneasily with the present strength of the housing market, as the two markets are generally assumed to be complementary.  Vehicle purchases rebounded strongly in the second quarter, and accounted for around half of the increase in quarterly consumption growth (see Chart 2.10).  But there are signs of a sharp slowing in the third quarter.  Private vehicle registrations in Q3 were 2% lower than a year earlier, down from 10.4% growth in the year to Q2. The ONS monthly retail sales index covers around 35% of household consumption—the latter also includes vehicles, energy and consumer services.  The most recent retail sales data, up to September, have shown some slowing in growth (see Chart 2.1 1), with quarterly growth of 0.7% in Q3—the lowest since 2000 Q2.   However, retail sales data and consumer spending this year have been affected by the timing of Easter as well as the two Jubilee Bank Holidays.  A box in the May Report highlighted how seasonal patterns and other factors can affect economic data.  A particular challenge this year was presented by the timing of the Easter holiday period, straddling the first and second quarters rather than the more usual timing of being exclusively in April.  Although the ONS attempted to take account of this timing change, it would appear that the seasonal adjustment this year may still have given too much of a boost to sales in April, and perhaps too little in March.  On seasonally adjusted data, retail sales this year rose by 0.1% in March and 1.7% in April.   Although the retail sales data were adjusted for the Bank Holiday falling in June rather than May, the ONS did not Table 2.F Expenditure components of demand(a) Percentage changes on a quarter earlier Average Average 2001 2002 2000 2001 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Consumption: Household 1.2 1.0 1.0 1.1 0.5 1.3 Government 0.3 1.3 2.7 1.8 2.9 -2.7 Investment: 1.1 -1.7 -0.7 -3.3 -1.5 -0.6 of which, business  investment 1.4 -2.2 -1.0 -4.5 -5.4 -0.2 Final domestic demand 1.0 0.6 1.0 0.5 0.6 0.3 Change in inventories (b) -0.2 -0.1 -0.5 0.3 0.1 -0.6 Excluding alignment  adjustment (b) -0.2 -0.2 -0.1 -0.5 0.7 -0.4 Domestic demand 0.8 0.6 0.5 0.8 0.7 -0.3 Exports 2.1 -1.3 -3.2 -1.6 -0.1 3.5 Imports 2.6 -0.6 -2.3 0.3 1.4 0.6 Net trade (b) -0.3 -0.2 -0.2 -0.6 -0.6 0.9 GDP at market prices 0.6 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.6 (a) At constant 1 995 market prices.

Demand 21 adjust the retail sales data for the additional Bank Holiday in June, as this was a one-off event.  It seems likely that the level of sales in June was reduced because some shops closed for an extra day.  Nevertheless Chart 2.1 1 suggests that the positive effect in April may have outweighed the negative effect in June, leaving an overall positive impact on the level of sales in the second quarter.   Table 2.G summarises the potential overall direction of these timing effects on the quarterly levels and growth rates of retail sales.  In particular, the timing of Easter may have boosted quarter-on-quarter growth in the second quarter because of both lower sales in the first quarter and higher sales in the second.  The level of sales in the third quarter should be largely unaffected, but the quarterly growth rate would be reduced because of the exceptionally higher level of sales in Q2. Such timing effects increase the difficulty of judging the underlying trend in retail sales.  Although recent three-month growth rates have been low, Chart 2.12 appears consistent with a broadly constant underlying trend in retail sales growth during the past year.  The value of household assets can have an important influence on consumption.  Section 1 explains that recent house price inflation has been higher than projected in the August Report. That is helping to support strong borrowing and consumption growth through mortgage equity withdrawal.  Equity prices fell sharply during late summer, but have since recovered much of that lost ground.  As yet, however, there has been little apparent effect of equity market weakness on consumption or consumer confidence.  The GfK consumer confidence survey has not picked up any large effect on consumer sentiment from equity prices.  Households remain optimistic about their own financial position over the next twelve months (see Chart 2.1 3), with the September survey recording the highest ever balance and only a small decrease in October.  The reading for the general economic situation has been close to its long-term average since the start of the year. As discussed above, households are likely to look beyond income in the current period when making spending decisions.  But Chart 2.1 4 shows that consumption growth has been correlated with income growth, although the relationship has been less strong since 1 990.(1) This may be because progressive financial innovation and deregulation have made it easier for households to borrow in order to smooth their consumption.

Inflation Report: November 2002 22 Household real post-tax income growth slowed during the first half of 2002 (see Chart 2.1 5).  This was mainly due to more volatile components, including a significant reduction in net property income in Q2.  As such, consumers may have viewed it as a temporary change more than a reduction in their permanent income, particularly given the climate of greater macroeconomic stability since the early 1 990s.  However, some of the reduction in net property income reflected lower dividend receipts—which consumers could potentially regard as a more persistent change if it were accompanied by reduced expectations of future earnings from equity holdings.  Looking ahead, the Committee expects a sharp, but temporary, slowdown in consumption growth in the third quarter, reflecting a likely fall in spending on vehicles and the timing effects discussed above.  But relatively robust growth is expected in the following six months, followed by a moderation through next year to a little below long-run trend rates. Public sector spending For some while, general government spending has been rising strongly, although there have been volatile movements from quarter to quarter.  Government consumption rose by 2.9% in 2002 Q1 and then fell by 2.7% in Q2—the largest quarterly increase since 1 97 5 followed by the largest quarterly fall since 1 985.  Despite the fall in 2002 Q2, the level of government consumption was 4.6% higher than a year earlier. Government investment was even more volatile, but followed the same pattern of a very strong first quarter and a fall-back in the second quarter.  Nevertheless, the level in 2002 Q2 was 1 1.6% higher than a year earlier.  Government spending data for the second quarter may have also been affected by the Jubilee Bank Holidays, for instance reflecting some public services being closed for an extra day in June.  So there might be some bounceback in the third quarter.  The MPC’s projections are based on the Government’s nominal spending plans, which imply continued robust growth in government spending over the forecast period. Investment Business investment is estimated to have edged down slightly in 2002 Q2, following sharp falls in the preceding two quarters.  These were the most severe falls in business investment for nearly ten years, and the Q2 level was almost 1 1% lower than a year earlier.  Moreover, Chart 2.1 6 shows that such a large year-on-year decrease in business investment is unusual at a time when GDP growth has remained positive. The recent fall in business investment is on a comparable scale Chart 2.14 Consumption and income growth 1964–2001 4 2 2 4 6 8 10 4 2 2 4 6 8 10 1964–89 1990–2001 Consumption growth, per cent Real post-tax income growth, per cent + – Chart 2.15 Contributions to real household post-tax  income growth(a) 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 2000 01 02 Contribution to quarterly growth, percentage points + – Other Prices Wages and salaries Net property income Taxes and social contributions Total (a) Deflated by the household consumption deflator.

The previous episode when business investment dropped sharply while GDP growth remained positive was in the mid-1 980s, and was a special case reflecting the effects of phased abolition of tax allowances for investment.  Revisions to the data since the August Report have  changed the profile of business investment through 2001. Chart 2.17 compares the quarterly growth rates of business investment in the latest data with those available at the time of the previous two Reports.  Although the total fall in investment is similar to that in the August Report, the quarterly profile has changed so that the decline is now estimated to have been concentrated in 2001 Q4 and 2002 Q1.  The latest data are much more consistent than the August vintage with investment plans having been put on hold because of increased uncertainty in the aftermath of the September 2001 terrorist attacks. Investment by the service sector is around 70% of business investment, so it is not surprising that it has accounted for a large proportion of the recent swings in business investment (see Chart 2.1 8).  In 2000, around one third of service sector investment was in ICT assets.  Although later data for the composition of service sector investment are not available, it seems plausible that reduced spending on ICT would have played a substantial part in the overall decline in investment, especially given the recent downturn in ICT output and imports.  Output of the electrical and optical engineering sector fell by 1 8.8% in the year to 2002 Q2, while ICT imports fell by 1 1.2%. Looking ahead, there is little sign of a turnaround in investment in the near term.  High capital gearing may impede future borrowing, and pension fund shortfalls could reduce the internal funds available for investment.  Capacity utilisation is currently close to, or possibly below, normal levels (see Section 3).  And uncertainty about the global recovery persists.  Table 2.H shows that in 2002 Q3 most survey measures of investment intentions fell to levels below the series averages.  The Committee expects business investment to dip a little further in the second half of 2002, and then to pick up gradually thereafter. Inventories  Inventories (excluding the statistical alignment adjustment) made a negative contribution to growth in four of the past  five quarters, largely driven by lower manufacturing stocks.   In 2002, the switch from first-quarter stockbuilding to  second-quarter destocking reduced Q2 GDP growth by  Chart 2.17 Business investment 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Percentage changes on a quarter earlier 2000 01 02 + _ Current August Inflation Report May Inflation Report Table 2.H Investment intentions(a) Series  2001 2002 average (b) Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 CBI Quarterly Industrial  Trends (c) Plant and machinery 0 -28 -28 -25 -1 3 -25 Buildings -17 -29 -29 -30 -1 8 -27 BCC manufacturing Plant and machinery 10 0 -5 -3 7 10 CBI/Grant Thornton  service sector survey (d) Vehicles, plant and  machinery -7 -2 1 -29 -1 5 -9 -26 Land and buildings -7 -25 -1 8 -22 -1 4 -20 Information technology 20 2 -17 4 20 -6 BCC services Plant and machinery 1 5 1 1 8 1 5 1 6 1 3 Sources:  BCC, CBI and Grant Thornton.

The choice of weights for those components affects how aggregate measures behave.  The weights are currently constructed according to the share in total output or expenditure of each component in a ‘base year’ , most recently 1 995.    There has been a five-yearly interval between base years.  At the most recent rebasing, in 1 998, the data were rebased to 1 995 prices, from 1 990 prices. Rebasing does not mean that all years of a series are recalculated using weights from the new base year. Instead, a ‘link year’ is chosen between the old and the new estimates.  The link year between 1 990 and 1 995 prices is 1 994.  The new weights are only  applied to a series from the link year onwards.   Before that, data are simply rescaled to the new  price basis. Demand is likely to grow more rapidly for goods and services whose relative prices are falling.  Hence rapidly growing sectors tend to be those with falling relative prices.  So for years after the base year, estimated real GDP growth would tend to be higher using base year weights, which are larger for the rapidly-growing sectors, than it would be using weights based on shares of current nominal GDP . Conversely, growth might be weaker in the years before the base year but after the link year.   With periodic rebasing of the National Accounts, a highly stylised version of such a pattern is shown in Chart A, on the purely illustrative assumption that the real growth rate abstracting from the effects of using base year weights would be constant.  With five-yearly rebasing, most years will be no more than two or three years away from a base year. However, as is common in the run-up to rebasing, the present year is seven years away from the base year. The potential distortion from base-weighting gets larger, the further away from the base year (see  Chart B).  In practice, however, prices and volumes move in ways that can upset the stylised assumptions above. Growth is not constant over time.  And there are many instances where the relative price of a component falls but volume growth is low, for example when  tastes change and relative demand for a product declines.  Indeed, a previous rebasing showed that growth was lower at 1 990 prices than at 1 985 prices, because of falls in oil prices and production between the two base years.  So actual GDP growth does not always follow the general pattern shown in Charts A and B.   When GDP was rebased to 1 995 prices, a number of other methodological changes were introduced, including moving to the European System of Accounts (ESA95).(1) Table 1 summarises the reasons for revisions to GDP growth in the 1 998 Blue Book.   The effect of rebasing was to reduce estimated growth, and in this case by an increasing amount  over time. Within domestic demand, the main changes in relative prices since 1 995 have been a strong general government consumption price deflator and a weak investment price deflator (see Table 2).  Using 1 995 rather than current prices would give a higher estimate of growth in 1 998, when investment was rising rapidly, because investment had a higher weight at 1 995 prices than it would have at current prices. Chart B Stylised impact of rebasing Base Base Base Constant growth Growth rate Old price basis New price basis Chart A Stylised impact of changing base years Base Base Base Base Base Constant  growth Growth rate (1) The effects of changing the base year and other revisions to the National Accounts were described on pages 1 4–1 5 of the November 1 998 Inflation Report.    Demand 25 The effect can go the other way too.  Government consumption has grown strongly recently, but its relative price has risen since 1 995.  And investment has fallen in the past six quarters despite a declining relative price.  Recent demand growth may therefore be higher at current prices than it is at 1 995 prices. This is because using current prices would give greater weight to strong government consumption, and less weight to weak investment, than using 1 995 prices. Similar considerations apply to movements within these broad components of demand.  For instance, the price of durable consumption goods has fallen relative to that of non-durable goods.  And the past few years have seen strong growth in spending on durable goods.  So real consumption growth measured using 1 995 prices is likely to be higher than it would be if measured using more up-to-date prices, which would give lower weight to the rapidly growing durables component.   If the effect of using 1 995 prices is to increase measured real consumption growth, then it also reduces the rate of increase in the consumption price deflator, which is the difference between observed nominal spending and estimated real spending.  The consumption deflator has indeed risen slowly over the past few years, when compared with other indicators of consumer price inflation, such as RPIX which is annually chain-linked. The MPC’s judgment is that the effect of weighting using base year relative prices is purely a measurement issue.  It affects estimates of both aggregate demand and potential supply, and therefore has no implications for the assessment of capacity pressures and inflation.  But, as noted in the August Report, it will need to be taken into account when comparing current forecasts, based on 1 995 prices, against subsequent published outturns on a different price basis. On the usual timetable, data for recent years would be rebased onto 2000 prices in the 2003 Blue Book. However, next year the ONS plans to introduce annually chain-linked measures to the UK National Accounts.  This will provide a more timely and accurate basis for comparisons and avoid measurement issues from base-year effects in the future.  It means that the price base will be updated each year, rather than every five years.  The ONS has suggested that the introduction of annual  chain-linking may cause estimates of real GDP growth in recent years to be revised slightly downwards.(2) This is consistent with the effects of rebasing suggested in the discussion above.

Chart 2.1 9 shows that although there was a build-up of retail stocks, manufacturing stocks fell sharply—the largest quarterly fall since 1 997 .  It is likely that there was a Jubilee effect, to the extent that manufacturers’ stocks may have been run down to compensate for lost production in June.  Despite the reductions in manufacturers’ inventories in recent quarters, the stock-output ratio has continued an increase that began in 1 999 (see Chart 2.20).  The ratio in 2002 Q1 was the highest for almost ten years.  It had been quite steady since the mid-1 990s, following a sharp fall from the early 1 980s.  If the recent rise were unintended, then it might point to further falls in manufacturing stocks in the quarters ahead.

Inflation Report: November 2002 26 the balance of firms with more than adequate stocks of finished goods was close to its long-run average (see  Chart 2.2 1).   The Committee assumes that the UK stock cycle is close to the end of the destocking phase, which would provide a one-off boost to GDP growth.  After that, inventory levels are assumed to move broadly in line with output.

(a) Balance of firms saying that present stocks of finished goods  are more than adequate against those saying stocks are less  than adequate.  27 Output and supply 3 3.1 Output The supply capacity of the economy depends on the  available factors of production (such as land, labour and capital equipment);  the work effort of labour and capital;  and the efficiency with which all the factors are used.   But the extent to which the growth of potential supply can vary, in part, depends on the horizon.  In the very short run, the number of people a business employs, the amount of physical capital it owns, and those factors’ efficiency of use  are relatively fixed.  So the business’s short-run supply decision is how much to produce given its existing  workforce and capital stock, in the light of its expectations  for demand and the price of its output.  The outcome of  these short-run supply decisions is reflected in GDP , which  is a measure of the output produced in any period.  In the medium term, businesses have more flexibility with respect  to the production process.  For example they can decide  how many people they employ and for how long and this will, in total, depend partly on the availability of labour, including the unemployed, and the number of hours people are prepared to work.  In the longer run, the economy’s  potential to grow will depend on population growth;  the profitability of capital investment;  and the extent to which innovations and ideas improve the economy’s ability to  turn labour effort into the goods and services that people demand.     Quarterly GDP growth slowed to 0.1% in 2002 Q1, but  has since picked up.  Nonetheless, GDP growth in 2002 Q2 and Q3, taken together, was lower than the Committee believed at the time of the August Report.  GDP is now estimated by the ONS to have increased by just 0.6% in  GDP growth in 2002 Q2 and Q3 taken together was a little weaker than expected by the MPC at the time of the August Report.  Capacity utilisation appears to be slightly below normal levels across the economy as a whole.  Aggregate rates of employment and unemployment have barely changed.  The  2001 Census has led the ONS to revise its estimates of the UK working-age population, but that has not affected the MPC’s judgment about growth in the near-term potential supply capacity of the economy. The Committee expects annual GDP growth to continue to pick up in the next six months.   Inflation Report: November 2002 28 2002 Q2, somewhat lower than the preliminary estimate of 0.9% reported in the August Report.  Services output and industrial production increased by 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively, in Q2.  The Jubilee holidays reduced the number of working days in June in many sectors of the economy.  In June, the ONS’ experimental index of services (IoS) fell by 1.8%, while industrial production fell by 4.3% (see Chart 3.1).  These were the lowest monthly growth rates since figures began in  January 1 995 for the IoS and since January 1 979 for industrial production.  Weighting together the IoS and industrial production (together representing 93% of GDP), overall output fell by 2.4% in June. GDP grew by 0.7% in Q3 according to the preliminary estimate.  Service sector output and industrial production grew by 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively.  Some pick-up in GDP growth might have been expected in Q3, reflecting the effects of the Jubilee holidays on the level of GDP in Q2.  Industrial production did indeed recover in July, it then fell modestly in August and September (see Chart 3.1).  Motor vehicles production was affected in June as holiday plant closures, which usually occurred later in the summer, were brought forward to the Jubilee week.  As a result, output increased strongly in July and August (see Chart 3.2), raising industrial production growth by at least 0.5 percentage points in each month, before falling back in September to around its May level.  Output in most other manufacturing industries was subdued in August and September.  In the electrical and optical goods sector, it fell by 3.9% in August, reducing industrial production growth by about 0.4 percentage points, and was little changed in September. Construction output increased by 7 .0% in the year to Q2, accounting for half of the growth of whole-economy gross value added at basic prices, despite only having a weight of 5.2% in national output.  Construction new orders were strong in Q3 and the future business activity index in the October CIPS construction survey continued to suggest rapid expansion in the sector. Growth in GDP compared with a year earlier reached a  trough of 1.0% in 2002 Q1.  It has since recovered to 1.7%  in Q3.  The Committee expects annual GDP growth to continue to pick up in the next six months. 3.2 Capacity utilisation Potential supply is difficult to estimate.  In part this is because the capital stock and the potential efficiency with which the Chart 3.1 Industrial production and the index of  services  96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 Jan. 2002 Feb. Mar. Apr.

Estimates of capacity utilisation provide an indication of whether businesses are operating above or below normal levels of supply capacity, given their existing amounts of factor inputs.  So they are potentially useful in assessing the balance between demand and supply in the economy in the short run, and hence the degree of inflationary pressure. When demand is weaker than businesses expect, initially that surprise may be reflected in some industries by a build-up in inventories.  But, thereafter, businesses may decide to lower output by reducing capacity utilisation—that is, the intensity they work their employees and capital equipment—for example by slowing the production line.  And businesses might also reduce the hours of their employees, for example by reducing overtime.  Hiring and firing costs inhibit frequent changes in employment levels.  Hence, businesses tend to hoard labour during slowdowns and only reduce employment if they revise down their expectations of demand in the medium term.  Resale values of capital equipment are often so low as to discourage premature disposal by businesses.  So it may not be worth their while to reduce the amount of capital significantly and quickly in the face of demand weakness. The CBI and British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) surveys include questions on capacity utilisation.  The CBI Industrial Trends survey asks whether businesses are working below a satisfactory full rate of operation, while the BCC survey asks if businesses are operating at full, or below full, capacity.  The CBI survey suggests capacity utilisation in manufacturing is currently well below its average level since 1 972 (see  Chart 3.3).  This is broadly consistent with the latest output figures described above.  In the service sector, the BCC survey was above its historical average in Q3, despite lower output growth in the past year. The BCC ‘manufacturing’ survey covers the rest of the economy—that is, agriculture, energy and construction, as well as manufacturing.  Table 3.A shows the BCC measure of capacity utilisation for these industries in Q3 was slightly above its average since 1 989, in contrast to the CBI survey balance for manufacturing which was well below its average since 1 972.  But recent output trends in construction have been very different to those in manufacturing, so the results from the two surveys are not directly comparable.  Moreover, the capacity utilisation questions in the respective surveys are not identical, and may be interpreted differently by respondents.  The Bank of England’s regional Agents ask businesses about their capacity utilisation.  In manufacturing, the responses are Chart 3.3 Capacity utilisation:  deviations from  average(a) 25 20 1 5 10 5 0 5 10 1 5 20 1 990 92 94 96 98 2000 02 Services (BCC) Percentage points Manufacturing (CBI) (b) _ + Manufacturing (BCC) (c) Sources:  BCC and CBI.

The October Industrial Trends survey, which was conducted between 1 9 September and 9 October, has been allocated to 2002 Q3.  Earlier surveys have been allocated to their respective quarters accordingly.   Inflation Report: November 2002 30 broadly consistent with those from the CBI survey.  Capacity utilisation is reported to be below normal levels, if somewhat higher than at the end of 2001.  In services, capacity is reported to be close to normal levels, a little weaker than that implied by the BCC survey. As much of the short-term variation in the supply of goods and services is likely to reflect changes in hours worked and work effort, the variation in labour productivity per person around its trend may also serve as a useful proxy for capacity utilisation.(1) Labour productivity is currently below its  trend level (see Chart 3.4).  So the labour productivity data, together with the CBI survey and the reports of the Bank of England’s regional Agents, suggest that, on balance, capacity utilisation is currently close to, but possibly a little lower than, normal. 3.3 Labour productivity In the medium term, potential supply will depend on, among other things, the rate of technical progress, the growth of the capital stock and improvements in the skills of the workforce. These will be reflected in the potential growth rate of labour productivity, which measures the volume of output per unit of labour input, expressed either in terms of persons employed or hours worked.   The ONS figures for whole-economy productivity are the  ratio of gross value added at basic prices to the total  number of jobs in the economy.(2) In the Bank of England’s main macroeconomic model, an alternative measure of productivity is used, based on the Labour Force Survey  (LFS) employment figures which are estimated from a survey  of households.  Output per job increased by 0.9% in the  year to 2002 Q2, while this alternative measure of output  per person was little changed in this period (see Chart 3.5). Though short-term weakness is to be expected, given movements in capacity utilisation, output per job has increased at an average annual rate of about 1.4% since  the mid-1 990s, and output per person by 1.2%.  This compares with average productivity growth of just over 2% since 1 960.  Why has productivity growth slowed in recent years? Output will depend in part on the average number of hours worked by each employee.  Average hours have fallen since the (1) See Larsen, J, Neiss, K and Shortall, F (2002), ‘Factor utilisation and productivity estimates for the United Kingdom’ , Bank of England Working Paper no. 162. (2) The ONS figures for jobs in its productivity series include employee jobs from the Workforce Jobs survey, working proprietors, the self-employed,  government-supported trainees and HM Forces.

Based on data unrevised for the effects of the 2001 Census (see the box on page 33).  Output and supply 31 onset of the recent slowdown, but they have also fallen steadily since 1 998.  Falling average hours of full-time employees have probably reflected in part the introduction of the Working Time Directive in October 1 998.(1) The growth of output per hour has thus been somewhat stronger than for output per job and per person (see Chart 3.5).  Whereas output per job has grown at an average annual rate of 1.4% since 1 995, average growth in output per hour has been 1.6% in this period. Labour productivity growth is affected by the rate of growth of capital employed, net of depreciation.  Measuring the capital stock is difficult, in part reflecting the difficulty of measuring scrapping and depreciation.  There are official estimates, but the ONS suspended publication temporarily at the time of the 2002 edition of the Blue Book.  Nevertheless, an indicator of the rate of capital accumulation is given by the ratio of business investment to GDP (measured at 1 995 prices).  This has been historically high since 1 995 (see Chart 3.6).  In part, this has reflected the fall in the price of investment goods relative to the general price level (see Chart 3.7), which has encouraged businesses to use more capital equipment rather than increase employment.  So the fall in labour productivity growth since the mid-1 990s is unlikely to have reflected, even in part, relatively low growth of the capital stock. Part of the fall in measured productivity growth reflects  weak recorded public sector productivity growth since 1 998. As with the rest of the service sector, the public sector is labour intensive and measured productivity growth is relatively low.  For example, productivity growth per job in public administration, education and health (which is mostly in the public sector) has averaged just 0.2% a year from  mid-1 980 to mid-1 998, whereas in the rest of the economy it averaged 2.6% in the same period (see Chart 3.8).  Even so, since 1 998, measured productivity growth in public administration, education and health has averaged -0.4% a year.  The decline in its average annual growth from 0.2% to  -0.4% since 1 998 has reduced annual growth of  whole-economy productivity per job by about 0.2 percentage points in this period.  But public sector output is very difficult to measure, as it is rarely marketed.  For example, estimates of output in the education sector are largely based on the number of pupils, adjusted to allow for their examination results.  Other things equal, a decline in the pupil-teacher ratio designed to improve the quality of education could therefore reduce measured productivity.  These measurement problems make the public sector productivity estimates particularly uncertain.

Inflation Report: November 2002 32 The fall in the unemployment rate since 1 993, currently to its lowest rate for 27 years (measured by the claimant count), may also have depressed productivity growth temporarily.  If, as seems likely, the unemployed have lower skills than the average employee, it may have had some temporary depressing effect on productivity growth.  Any such effect might gradually unwind as new employees benefit from additional work experience. 3.4 Employment Beyond the very short run, one way businesses can increase their collective output is by increasing employment.  The box on page 33 explains how the results from the 2001 Census will affect estimates of employment and other labour market indicators.  The ONS has so far released some provisional estimates only up to August 2001.  So the more recent  labour market data discussed in the following sections  are unaffected by the Census revisions, unless otherwise stated.   Employment measured by the household-based LFS increased by 2 1 1,000 in the period June-August compared with the same period a year earlier.  Almost all of this increase was in  part-time employment.  LFS figures show that the part-time share of employment increased to about 25% in 1 996, when it levelled off (see Chart 3.9).  It has risen again since mid-2001 and is currently at its highest level since the quarterly LFS began in 1 992.  The part-time employees’ share of total hours worked has risen fairly steadily since 1 993 (although there was a temporary decline in the second half of 2001).  This has reflected falling average hours worked by full-time employees and, until the past year, rising average hours worked by  part-time employees. The LFS figures show the number of employees in employment increased by about 1 80,000 in the year to June-August.  But employee jobs measured by the employer-based quarterly Workforce Jobs survey were almost unchanged in the year to 2002 Q2.  The apparent difference between these two trends may be reduced by future upward revisions to the Workforce Jobs estimates.  This has been the pattern of recent years when new information on jobs becomes available from the ONS’ Annual Business Inquiry in December.  Nevertheless, the Workforce Jobs survey is the most  reliable source for the industrial breakdown of  employment.  Public administration, education and  health—which is mostly public sector—accounted for the bulk of the growth of jobs in the service sector in the year  to 2002 Q2.  Jobs in construction increased by 1.8% in the Chart 3.9 Part-time share of employment 23.4 23.8 24.2 24.6 25.0 25.4 25.8 1 993 94 95 96 97 98 99 2000 01 02 10.4 10.8 1 1.2 1 1.6 12.0 12.4 12.8 Per cent of total hours worked Persons (left-hand scale) Hours (right-hand scale) Per cent of total employment 0.0 0.0 Chart 3.10 Workforce Jobs growth by sector 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 Manufacturing Public   administration,   education and   health  Other services Construction Average annual growth since 1 979 Q2 Growth in year to 2002 Q2 Per cent + _ Chart 3.11 Private and public sector employee jobs 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 1 982 84 86 88 90 92 94 96 98 2000 Public sector Private sector Percentage changes on a year earlier + –  Output and supply 33 The 2001 Census The 2001 Census estimated that the UK population was 58.8 million on Census day, 29 April.  This was about 1.2 million less than the mid-2001 projection of the population by the Government Actuary’s Department (GAD).  The ONS currently judges that most of this discrepancy is a result of underestimation of emigration(1)—in particular of men between  25 and 44 years of age (see Chart A)—although the precise causes are uncertain and other explanations are possible.  In light of the Census, the 1 991 mid-year estimate of the population has also been revised down, by about 300,000.  As a result, the annual growth rate of the population over the past two decades has also been revised down by an average of around 0.1 percentage points. Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates of the  whole-economy levels of employment and unemployment are grossed up using estimates of  the household population.  So a downward  revision to the population reduces the LFS  estimates of the levels of employment and unemployment.  Moreover, since the Census has  also revised down the estimated share of  prime-age (25–44) men in the population, who  have high participation and employment rates,  these rates are also being revised.  On 30 October  the ONS released provisional regrossed labour  market data for the period 1 992–2001.  These data show that, for example, in June-August 2001,  working-age employment was over 800,000 lower,  at about 26.6 million, and the working-age employment rate was 0.3 percentage points lower at 7 4.3%. Workforce Jobs estimates of employment will be less directly affected, as they are derived primarily from  a survey of companies rather than households and  are not grossed up using the population data.   However, the Workforce Jobs estimates for  self-employment, and employment in the agriculture and construction sectors, are based on LFS data and are therefore likely to be revised.  National Accounts data for GDP are expected to be largely unaffected.  So estimates of labour productivity based on the Workforce Jobs series should be little changed, although estimates derived from LFS employment figures, such as those used in the Bank of England’s main macroeconomic model, will be higher back to the early 1 980s. While the new population figures have important consequences for the interpretation of labour  market data, the MPC has concluded that in broad terms they should not significantly affect the inflation outlook.

(1) The number of births and deaths each year is available from registration records.  The gross flow of migrants is estimated using data from the International Passenger Survey and administrative data on asylum applications and visitors who become permanent residents.  However, there are other data—for example, on applications for permanent settlement and National Insurance numbers—which can be used to corroborate an estimate of the gross inflow.  The determinant of population about which the ONS know least is the gross outflow of migrants.  Hence, in the view of the ONS, the  Census-based revisions most likely reflect changes in the underlying estimates of the gross outflow. year to Q2 (see Chart 3.10), reflecting the buoyancy of  activity in that sector.  The increase in jobs in these two sectors fully offset the decline in manufacturing jobs in this period.   The public sector accounts for nearly 1 8% of jobs.  After  two decades of relative decline, public sector employment  has grown at a slightly faster rate than that of the private sector over the period since 1 999 (see Chart 3.1 1).  As noted above, employment growth has been particularly strong in education and health.  Public spending has risen from 37 .4%  Inflation Report: November 2002 34 of GDP in 1 999–2000 to 39.3% of GDP in 2001–02.  The 2002 Spending Review projects the ratio rising to 41.9%  of GDP in 2005–06.(1) So further significant increases in public sector employment are likely.  But reports from the Bank’s regional Agents suggest that companies’ employment intentions in the private sector have generally weakened a little since Q2. 3.5 Labour supply For a given rate of economic inactivity, an increase in the population of working age would provide an increase in  labour supply in the long term, thereby adding to potential output.  In the shorter term, the most obvious sources of additional labour are the economically inactive and the unemployed.  Working-age population The number of people of working age (1 6–59 for women  and 1 6–64 for men) has risen steadily as a share of the  total population since the early 1 970s (see Chart 3.12).  In  the following decade, an increasing working-age  population mostly reflected a rising birth rate prior to the mid-1 960s, associated with the post-war ‘baby boom’ .   Since then, births generally have been falling.  Nonetheless, the working-age population rate is higher now than in the  late 1 980s.  That reflects inward migration.  The 2001  Census has led to a downward revision in the working-age population rate in 2001 of 0.5 percentage points.  In particular, the ONS believes that the Census has cast doubt  on previous estimates of gross emigration over the past  two decades, notably of men aged 25–44 (see the  box on  page 33).  However, the Census did not change the overall picture of an increasing working-age population rate since 1 971.  The data for working-age population during the past twelve months are still to be revised using the results of the 2001 Census.  On the basis of unrevised data, the working-age population and LFS-based employment have grown at similar rates in the year to June-August and the working-age employment rate has barely changed. Participation Labour force participation trends reveal whether labour supply is rising or falling, relative to the size of the population of working age.

Output and supply 35 The participation rate(1) was broadly unchanged in  June-August compared with the same three months a year earlier (see Chart 3.1 3).  The participation rate has generally been on a modest upward trend since the mid-1 990s.  The female participation rate increased by about 2 percentage points between mid-1 994 and mid-2000.  It fell back a little in the second half of 2001 but it has since been rising again and has now returned to its mid-2000 peak.  Its increase since 1 994 has more than offset a steadily declining rate for men. Increased female participation in part reflects the rise in participation of lone parents.  The activity rate of female lone parents with children under 1 6 was 56% in March-May 2002, up from 50% six years earlier.  The rise in activity of lone parents since 1 996 explains around one third of the  1.6 percentage point increase in the female participation rate in this period.  And they have found jobs:  the employment rate of female lone parents has risen by about 9 percentage points in six years, to around 50% in March-May 2002.  In part these trends have reflected government policy, especially the New Deal for Lone Parents, the Working Families’ Tax Credit and the National Childcare Strategy.(2) The Government has targeted a 70% lone parent employment rate by 2010.  If this were met, and assuming it fully reflected increased activity, rather than falling unemployment, this would increase the overall participation rate by around  0.1 percentage points a year on average during the next eight years—the average rate of increase since 1 995. Unemployment The difference between labour supply and demand is central to the determination of wage inflation.   The most common measure of the excess of labour supply over demand is the unemployment rate.  This has barely changed in the past twelve months.  The claimant count unemployment rate was 3.1% in September and has been 3.1%–3.2% for  1 8 months.  The International Labour Organisation (ILO) definition of unemployment used by the LFS was 5.2% in the three months to August, compared with 5.1% in the same period a year earlier (see Chart 3.1 4).  Despite this small increase, ILO unemployment has been extremely stable over the past twelve months.  Other indicators are generally consistent with the unemployment figures, suggesting that the (1) The participation rate is defined as the economically active of working age as a percentage of the working-age population.  The LFS classifies as ‘economically active’ those people with a job and those who meet the International Labour Organisation definition of unemployment used by the LFS.  Chart 3.1 3 shows the participation rate prior to the revisions resulting from the 2001 Census. These generally reduced its level by about 1/4 percentage point from mid-1 993 to August 2001, mostly reflecting the downward revision to the number of working-age males, who have a relatively high participation rate.

While some surveys and reports from the Bank’s regional Agents indicate a marginal easing in recruitment difficulties, any such slackening appears to be modest.  37 Costs and prices 4 Inflationary pressures are determined by the balance of demand and supply in product and labour markets.  They are also influenced by developments in the exchange rate, overseas prices, and the inflation expectations of employers and employees.  4.1 Earnings and settlements According to the Average Earnings Index (AEI), headline earnings growth has been relatively stable at just below 4% since May.  Whole-economy pay settlements have been stable at around 3% (see Table 4.A).  Private sector earnings growth has recovered from the low rates seen at the start of the year (see Chart 4.1).  The weakness then was caused by lower bonus payments than in 2001.  But in August, for the first time in 1 8 months, bonus payments grew broadly in line with regular pay and so had no net effect on annual private sector pay growth.  Annual earnings growth in the public sector has continued to ease and settlements have remained stable.  In the twelve months to September, public sector settlements were 3.6%, unchanged from August.  Chart 4.2 shows that annual public sector earnings growth was 3.0% in August, almost  3 percentage points below its peak in August 2001.  This softening in public sector pay growth is somewhat at odds with the continued strength in public sector spending (see Section 2) and the growth in public sector employment (see Section 3).  While a number of factors can explain this profile of earnings growth, part of it reflected threshold payments to teachers in 2001, which raised the level of earnings permanently, but raised earnings growth for one year only.  Whole-economy average earnings growth has been stable at just below 4% since May.  In the past three months, oil prices have risen steeply and then fallen, probably reflecting changing market sentiment about the prospect of a military attack on Iraq.  The increase in the price of oil since the beginning of the year is putting some upward pressure on manufacturers’ input costs and output prices.  RPIX inflation rose to 2.0% in the year to Q3;  goods prices continued to fall and strong retail services price inflation persisted.  The MPC expects RPIX inflation to move above the 2.5% target by the end of the year, largely reflecting the pattern of oil price movements and an increasing contribution from housing depreciation. It is expected to remain above target during much of 2003 and then drop back. Table 4.A Average earnings growth Percentage changes on a year earlier 2002 May June July Aug. Sept.

(b) Twelve-month weighted mean.  The weights are the AEI industry shares of the wage bill.  Sources noted in Table 4.A.  Inflation Report: November 2002 38 Another factor that might explain the recent fall in public sector earnings growth is the delay to this year’s local authority (LA) settlement.  The settlement was due in April,  but not agreed until September.  The higher settlement was due to enter pay packets from October.  As this settlement affects 1.3 million workers (about 25% of the public sector wage bill), the delay has depressed public sector earnings growth.  While the recently agreed LA settlement is likely to raise public sector earnings growth, the arrears of this  settlement (backdated to April) will not.  This is because  the ONS does not include arrears in its seasonally adjusted data. Whole-economy regular pay growth per head has been falling gently since the middle of 2001 (see Chart 4.3).  When calculated in terms of pay per hour, the trend in the growth rate has been much flatter, and has perhaps picked up more recently.  Why might that matter?  If everybody were paid by the hour, then the hourly growth rate would be the more relevant for judging trends in wage pressure.  But as the August Report noted, only about 40% of employees in the economy are paid by the hour, equivalent to a third of the wage bill.  So the pick-up in pay per hour is partly related to the recent sharper fall in average hours.  The ONS presents its average hours data as a three-month moving average.  The final hours observation in Chart 4.3 refers to the three months to August.  So the final three observations in that chart may have been affected by the Jubilee holidays in June. If average hours were to recover, as Jubilee effects pass or for purely cyclical reasons, the gap between pay growth per hour and pay growth per head would narrow, probably with both a slowing in regular pay growth per hour and a pick-up in pay growth per head.  The outlook for real earnings growth depends on employers’ demand for labour relative to the available supply (see  Section 3).  But nominal earnings growth is also influenced by inflation expectations.  Employees care about the purchasing power of their earnings (the real consumption wage) and businesses care about the cost of labour relative to the price of their output (the real product wage).  But because the basic wage is typically set at discrete intervals, usually yearly, employees and employers care about future inflation.   Chart 4.4 shows two measures of inflation expectations, the Quarterly Consensus Forecasts and the Bank of England/NOP survey.(1) Both fell in Q3 from 2.4% to 2.2%.  So inflation expectations seem unlikely to give any upward impetus to wage settlements in the near term.

For the latest survey results see www.bankofengland.co.uk/pressreleases/2002/096.htm  Costs and prices 39 Looking ahead, earnings growth may edge up at the end of the year as local authority employees receive their new settlement. Thereafter earnings growth is likely to increase somewhat through 2003, given the continued tightness of the labour market.  The prices that businesses charge for their products depend, among other things, on the cost of producing those goods or services.  So price inflation can be influenced by changes in unit wage costs.  While transient changes in unit wage costs can affect inflation, it is the underlying growth that is probably more important.  This is because businesses incur costs when they change prices—for example the expense of printing new price lists.  So they are more likely to change prices infrequently and when they are confident that any change is unlikely to reverse.  Though it is often difficult to discern the underlying trend, it is likely that unit wage cost growth in recent quarters has been boosted by a temporary cyclical lull in productivity growth (see Chart 4.5).  Indeed, the MPC projects unit wage cost growth to fall next year as productivity growth is expected to recover. 4.2 Commodity prices After the publication of the August Report, the price of oil continued to increase.  It rose to a peak of $29 per barrel on 23 September.  But it has fallen sharply in recent weeks (see Chart 4.6).  The average price of oil in the 1 5 days to  6 November was $26 per barrel, similar to the 1 5-day average to 3 1 July (the day the MPC finalised its August projections). The gyrations in the price are likely to have been associated with changing market perceptions over the prospect of a military attack on Iraq, and the related risk of disruption to world oil supply.  In the first half of this year, Iraq produced 2.0 million barrels of oil a day, or 3% of world output (see Chart 4.7).  Most countries, with the exception of Saudi Arabia, do not have significant amounts of spare capacity.  In this sense, Saudi Arabia can be thought of as the marginal oil producer, able to influence heavily the price of oil.  Saudi Arabia could increase production by between 2.4–2.7 million barrels a day, within  30 days, enough to offset any Iraqi shortfall.(1) In the near term, market participants appear to expect the oil price to continue to fall to around $22 per barrel in two years’ time.  The profile of the Brent futures price over the next two years is broadly similar to what it was at the time of the August Report.  This profile implies that twelve-month oil price Chart 4.5 Whole-economy unit wage cost and  productivity growth 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 1 995 96 97 98 99 2000 01 02 Percentage changes on a year earlier Productivity growth Unit wage cost growth + _ Chart 4.6 Brent Oil futures 5 10 1 5 20 25 30 35 40 1 995 97 99 2001 03 $ per barrel   6 November (a) August Report (a) 0 Source:  Thomson Financial Datastream and Bank of England.

The impact on annual RPIX inflation is therefore likely to be positive for the remainder of this year—both directly through higher petrol prices and indirectly via the pass-through to higher costs of production—and negative in the second half of 2003. The price of non-oil commodities rose by 6.1% in Q3, mainly due to the higher price of food, which rose by 1 1.3% in Q3. But the futures curve for non-oil commodities—a weighted average of 25 separate commodities—was broadly similar to what it was at the time of the August Report.  Within the total, however, there were offsetting movements.  Food price futures rose (see Chart 4.8) and the price of metals and other  non-food agricultural commodities fell.  The rise in spot and futures food prices was quite broadly based and appears to have been driven by a combination of supply-side factors: droughts in different regions of the world have combined to reduce the supply of wheat, corn and soyabean;  cocoa prices have been affected by political conflict in the Ivory Coast—the world’s largest producer;  and the recent rise in coffee prices was in part due to producers substituting away from coffee, in response to the exceptionally low prices at the beginning of the year. 4.3 Import prices Sterling import prices of goods and services in 2002 Q2 were a little higher than assumed at the time of the August Report. The quarterly change in import prices rose sharply from -0.8% in Q1 to 1.6% in Q2.  Exchange rate changes seem to account for most of the rise in import prices.  The sterling effective exchange rate depreciated by 1.5% between Q1 and Q2.  The weighted average price of exports from the major six (M6) economies (a proxy for the prices of internationally traded goods and services) remained unchanged.  The MPC projection for annual M6 export price inflation is little different to its August Report projection, but the projection for annual UK import price inflation is a little weaker.  In part this can be explained by the around 1% higher starting assumption of the sterling effective exchange rate in the fourth quarter of this year (compared with what was assumed at the time of the August Report) which is likely to lower the sterling price of imports.   4.4 Costs and prices in manufacturing Input prices fell by 1% in the twelve months to September, compared with a fall of 1.9% in the twelve months to August (see Chart 4.9).

And it was the precipitous fall in the price of oil in 2001 (or base effects) dropping out of the annual comparison that accounted for most of the pick-up in the twelve-month rate for September.  The remainder was due to the rise in oil prices since July this year.   Headline annual earnings growth in the manufacturing sector has risen steadily since the start of the year, but manufacturing productivity growth rose more sharply.   Annual earnings growth rose from 2.9% in Q1 to 3.5% in Q2, and annual productivity growth rose from -1.9% to -0.6% over the same period.  These two effects imply that unit wage cost growth eased from 5.0% in Q1 to 4.1% in Q2.  As mentioned above, the underlying growth in costs (of both raw materials and labour) is an important influence on the prices that companies charge for their goods.  But it is not the only factor.  The pressures on capacity and the degree of competition are also important.  Faced with spare capacity (see Section 3) and intense global competition, domestic manufacturing firms have had little scope for passing on cost increases.  In the twelve months to September, output prices (excluding duties) rose by 0.4%, unchanged since August.  4.5 Costs and prices in the service sector Labour costs account for the majority of service sector input costs and so are key to determining the short-run pressures on service sector output prices.  Headline annual earnings growth in the private service sector recovered from 2.2% in Q1 to 4.2% in Q2.  Private service sector productivity growth over the same period fell a little.  Consequently private service sector unit wage cost growth rose from 0.4% in Q1 to 2.6% in Q2, raising cost pressures since the start of the year (see  Table 4.B).  This is consistent with the CIPS survey, which showed a small rise in the balance of firms reporting a rise in input costs since the end of 2001.  But private service sector earnings growth rose between Q1 and Q2 because the large negative bonus contribution to annual earnings growth diminished in Q2.  In terms of regular pay growth, annual private service sector earnings growth did not change much on the quarter.  So underlying private service sector unit wage cost growth, perhaps a more important influence on firms’ prices, was relatively flat. The only official measure of output prices in business services is the ONS’ corporate services price index (CSPI).  This index captures business-to-business transactions only.  This survey remains experimental and to date covers around 50% of its target population.  Importantly, it does not yet include insurance premia which, according to the Bank’s regional Table 4.B Measures of service sector costs and prices(a) 2001 2002 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4(b) Backward-looking CIPS average costs index (c) 51.8 53.1 53.9 54.6 54.2 CIPS average prices  charged index (c) 49.6 50.6 51.6 51.9 52.2 CSPI (d) 4.1 2.8 2.5 n.a. n.a.

The CSPI shows that business services price inflation has been falling since the start of 2001, with the fall being broadly-based across property rental payments, oil-related services (such as sea freight and road transport) and other business services (see Chart 4.10).  The fall in the ONS measure of business services price inflation stands in contrast to the increase in the CIPS balance of firms reporting a rise in prices since the start of the year and the continued strength in retail services price inflation (see Chart 4.1 1).  While a large part of the divergence between business and retail services price inflation is accounted for by the impact of the oil price on oil-related business services, some of it may reflect the differences between the state of demand in the respective sectors. Forward-looking survey indicators offer mixed signals about what might happen to service sector prices in the near future. The volatility of the CBI/Grant Thornton survey makes it hard to read the underlying trend (see Table 4.B).  The BCC survey shows that the balance of respondents expecting to raise prices over the next three months is a little weaker than it was at the start of the year. 4.6 Retail prices Annual inflation in retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments (RPIX) rose by 0.1 percentage points to 2.0% in Q3. This rise was echoed in the other main measures of retail price inflation.  Annual RPIY inflation (which also excludes indirect and local authorities’ taxes) rose by 0.1 percentage points to 1.9%; and the headline rate of inflation (RPI) rose by  0.3 percentage points to 1.5%.  The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) measure of inflation rose by 0.2 percentage points to 1.1% in the year to Q3.  What accounts for the 0.9 percentage points difference between HICP and RPIX inflation in Q3?  RPIX and HICP measure the average price of a basket of goods and services. The formula used to add together the prices in the RPIX measure is different from that used in the HICP index.(1) This ‘formula effect’ accounts for much of the persistence in the gap (see Chart 4.1 3).  The factor that explains most of the current differential is the inclusion of housing costs(2) in RPIX but not in the HICP , and recently house price inflation has been particularly strong (see Section 1). Since the Bank of England was given operational independence in 1 997 , the annual inflation rate of RPIX has been very stable;  it has averaged 2.3% with a standard Chart 4.11 Business and retail services price inflation 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 999 2000 01 02 Percentage changes on a year earlier Businesses (CSPI) Retail    (RPIX services)  Chart 4.12 Retail price inflation 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 1 995 96 97 98 99 2000 01 02 RPI RPIX RPIY Percentage changes on a year earlier (1) RPIX uses the arithmetic mean and HICP the geometric mean to aggregate price quotes at the most detailed level.

This stability has also been evident since inflation targeting was introduced in 1 992. Chart 4.1 4 shows two measures of inflation volatility:  monthly changes to the annual rate of inflation, and the two year rolling standard deviation of the annual rate.  The rolling standard deviation is considerably lower now than it was in the 1 970s.  But recently inflation volatility has ticked up a little. This can be seen from the slightly larger amplitude of the monthly changes in the annual inflation rate in 2001/02. There was also a slight rise in the rolling standard deviation. In the past year the annual inflation rate has changed by  0.5 percentage points or more (from month to month) four times.  The previous time this occurred was in 1 991, but changes then were related to changes in VAT and the council tax.  Most of the recent volatility in RPIX inflation can be attributed to a few components, notably seasonal food and petrol. Indeed, the contribution of these two components alone can explain most of the volatility in RPIX inflation, particularly over the past year (see Chart 4.1 5).  Seasonal food and petrol prices have not been particularly volatile on their own, when compared with past history.  In general, the two series are unlikely to move together because they are influenced by quite different factors:  seasonal food prices are typically affected by weather conditions, whereas the oil price is determined by the interaction of global demand for and supply of oil.  But in the recent past, seasonal food and petrol prices have moved somewhat unusually together for a prolonged period of time (see Chart 4.1 6), giving rise to the volatility in annual RPIX inflation. In September, annual retail services price inflation rose to 4.8% and goods price inflation rose to -0.9% (see Chart 4.17), maintaining the gap between goods and services price inflation at 5.7 percentage points.  The widening in the differential between goods and services price inflation seen during the past four years has not been confined to the United Kingdom;  though less pronounced, it has been a feature of the United States also (see Chart 4.1 8).  One explanation for the fall in goods prices is weak manufacturing input prices (see page 40), magnified by intense global competition in the market for tradable goods. The rise in retail services price inflation since the start of 2001 was mainly due to the increased contribution of leisure and household services.  A large part of the pick-up in leisure services inflation reflected unusually strong increases in cable/satellite TV subscription charges and package holidays abroad.  After 1 1 September 2001, holiday companies were concerned that people would be less willing to fly and so they Chart 4.14 The volatility of RPIX inflation(a) 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 1 970 7 4 78 82 86 90 94 98 2002 Percentage points + _ Rolling standard    deviation (b) Inflation targeting    introduced  Bank    independence  Monthly change    in annual     inflation rate (a) RPI inflation prior to 1 976.

Inflation Report: November 2002 44 cut back supply.  The subsequent price rise suggests that demand may not have fallen back by as much as they had expected.  Household services inflation has risen sharply mainly because telephone charges (both for mobile phones and land lines) have not fallen at the rates they had done in previous years. Looking ahead, the MPC expects that annual RPIX inflation will move above the target by the end of the year.  This projected increase is mostly accounted for by two components: petrol prices and housing depreciation.  The strength of oil prices now compared with the oil price in 2001 Q4 implies that the contribution from petrol prices to annual inflation is expected to rise in 2002 Q4.  The housing depreciation component measures the costs that owner-occupiers face to maintain the quality of their home.  It is meant to capture large infrequent renovations, like replacing a roof.  As housing depreciation is not directly measured, it is proxied by a weighted average of lagged house prices, as measured by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) house price index.  This method of calculation means that the current strength in house price inflation will continue to have a further upward impact on RPIX inflation in the coming months.  The MPC expects RPIX inflation to remain somewhat above the target of 2.5% for much of 2003.  Then inflation may drop below 2.5%, before gradually approaching the target by the end of the forecast horizon.  The projection is described in greater detail in Section 6.

Four-quarter GDP growth was expected to return gradually to around-trend rates.  The MPC judged that the risks relative to the central projection were weighted marginally on the downside for growth and slightly on the upside for inflation. At its meeting on 4–5 September, the Committee first discussed the world economy.  Equity markets had stabilised during August, above the low points reached in July, but had recorded further sharp falls in the days leading up to the Committee’s meeting.  However, equity markets remained volatile and little significance could be attached to short-term movements.  Long-term forward interest rates had fallen in the major economies, reversing increases earlier in the year.  The fall seemed largely to represent lower real rates.  It was possible that it reflected market doubts about the speed of recovery, or that the volatility in equity markets had increased the attractiveness of government bonds.  But it was not obviously related to any particular economic news. Recent data from the United States were broadly consistent with the Committee’s August projections.  Economic news from the euro area continued to be weaker than expected and it was still unclear whether sustained recovery in Japan was under way, although the rest of Asia seemed to be growing quite strongly.  A number of Latin American countries continued to face severe economic problems although there was more positive news on the month from Brazil and Argentina. UK monetary data had shown signs of slowing.  The corporate sector, including financial companies, had accounted for the This section summarises the economic developments and monetary policy decisions taken by the MPC since the August Report.(1) The Bank’s repo rate was maintained at 4% in September, October and November. (1) The minutes of the August, September and October meetings are reproduced under a separate cover, published alongside this Report.  Inflation Report: November 2002 46 easing.  Household borrowing had remained strong and mortgage equity withdrawal as a percentage of personal disposable income was close to the rates seen in the late 1 980s.  While monetary and some housing indicators suggested that consumption still had considerable momentum, retail sales growth had eased in July and survey evidence pointed to further weakening in August.  The latest data suggested that labour demand might be a little weaker than expected.  RPIX inflation had picked up sharply in July and had been stronger than expected.  In discussing the immediate policy decision, the Committee noted that the world economy was a little weaker than it had appeared to be a month earlier.  UK consumption growth and house price inflation were showing tentative signs of slowing and the key issue was how much weight should be put on these signals.  A slowing in consumption growth would be unwelcome if it were too abrupt or too early, particularly if the recovery in world activity were to be less strong.  Against this background, the Committee considered whether pre-emptive action to delay the slowing in consumption growth might be warranted.  However, the Committee agreed that it was premature to conclude that further stimulus was necessary. Once allowance had been made for the effects of Jubilee holidays on the pattern of output, there was little evidence that the UK recovery was faltering, and the evidence of consumption growth slowing prematurely was not clear cut. Reducing interest rates at this stage could encourage households to accumulate yet more debt and renew the upward pressure on house prices.   The Committee noted that a decision to maintain the repo rate at 4% did not represent a lack of policy response to the  slower-than-expected recovery in world activity and falls in equity prices.  For much of this year the prospects had been that inflation would be moving sharply above target at the  two-year horizon, and it had been widely expected that official interest rates would by now need to be on an upward path. That the repo rate had still not increased in itself represented a response to the changed prospect for inflation.  This was reflected in lower market interest rates, maintaining monetary conditions which continued to support the growth of domestic demand. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the Bank’s repo rate at 4%. At its meeting on 9–10 October, the Committee began by considering the world economy.  The main development since their previous meeting had once again been the substantial fall in most leading equity market indices.  Monetary policy since the August Report 47 The US economy still seemed to be evolving broadly as envisaged in the August Report, while economic news from the euro area had been a little weaker than the Committee had expected.  But the export-led recovery in Japan appeared to be continuing, while domestic demand in several other Asian economies was now growing robustly.  For the world economy as a whole, the latest indicators and the falls in equity prices, if sustained, suggested that prospects for activity might be a little weaker than envisaged at the time of the August Report. In the UK economy, equity prices had fallen by less than in most other major markets over the month and the sterling exchange rate had risen to 11/2% above the level assumed for the third quarter at the time of the August Report.  Since the August Report, government bond rates had fallen by less than in the United States and the euro area, while investment-grade corporate bond spreads had risen by less.  This was consistent with a relative improvement in UK growth prospects.  House prices had continued to rise sharply, although there were some tentative indications that activity in the housing market might be slowing.  The greater-than-expected rise in house prices would tend to offset the influence of falling equity prices on consumption, and might lead to stronger near-term prospects for consumption than envisaged in the August Report. Consumption had grown slightly faster in Q2 than predicted in the Committee’s forecast, but was expected to grow more slowly in Q3 as the timings of the Jubilee and Easter holidays had affected the profile of retail sales.  There had also been a very sharp decline in car sales.  But there were also signs of continuing strength.  Retail sales had risen by 0.6% in August. And the GfK survey had shown households’ confidence in their own economic position over the next twelve months to be at a record high. Business investment was broadly unchanged in Q2.  Although a further fall had been anticipated, revisions to back data meant that the level of business investment in Q2 was broadly in line with the August Inflation Report.  Manufacturing output and industrial production had been weaker than expected.  Current indicators were consistent with a very modest easing in the labour market.  There was little sign of any overall change in pay pressures, and private sector settlements were lower than this time last year.  RPIX inflation was 1.9% in the year to August, but was expected to rise towards, and possibly above, the 2.5% target by the end of the year. While discussing the immediate policy decision, the Committee noted that the news over the month suggested that the prospects for the world economy were slightly weaker than envisaged in the August Report, largely reflecting  Inflation Report: November 2002 48 developments in the euro area.  Downside risks to the world economy also appeared greater and the recent falls in equity prices, if sustained, posed a further risk to the outlook.  The Committee agreed that the key issue was whether, in the face of continuing slow growth in external demand, monetary policy should provide a further stimulus to domestic demand.   The Committee identified a number of possible reasons for reducing the repo rate.  First, the outlook for the global economy was a little weaker.  Second, equity prices had fallen further and the rise in sterling had not proved temporary. Third, the downside risks to the outlook had increased. Finally, the profile of inflation had already been expected to be below target for most of the next two years at the time of the August Inflation Report, and an interest rate reduction had been under consideration for some time, so on this view the recent news would justify a reduction in rates without waiting for the next quarterly forecast.   The Committee also identified possible arguments for leaving the repo rate unchanged:  the continued resilience of domestic demand;  a rising profile for inflation at the end of the forecast horizon in the August Report;  and the difficulty in precisely quantifying the net effect on inflation of changes to equity and house prices, the exchange rate and other news. It was not clear either that the world outlook would be significantly softer than in the August Report. The Committee agreed that the decision remained finely balanced.  Most members, weighing the arguments, preferred to leave the repo rate unchanged.  Others regarded news in the past month, together with other news since August, as sufficient to warrant an immediate reduction to official interest rates. The Committee voted by 6 to 3 to maintain the repo rate at 4%. At its meeting on 6–7 November, the Committee voted to maintain the Bank’s repo rate at 4%.  49 Prospects for inflation 6 6.1 The inflation projection assumptions Supported by macroeconomic policy, the gradual strengthening in world activity has continued in recent months.  But the recovery remains patchy and uneven, and there continues to be considerable uncertainty surrounding the pace and solidity of the global upswing.   Business and consumer confidence indicators show no clear pattern at the global level:  although some measures point to a gradual improvement in activity, others signal some loss of impetus.  Financial markets remain unsettled.  Following the steep decline in June and July, global equity prices fell further in the late summer.  Although prices have recovered ground in recent weeks, equities remain well down on levels earlier in the year.  Market volatility remains high by historical standards. Short-term market interest rates and long-term bond yields have declined again, consistent with some weakening in the near-term demand outlook, although lower interest rates should also help to promote a stronger recovery in activity subsequently.  The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to 1.25% on 6 November to provide a further stimulus to the recovery in the United States.  The resilience of the upturn in the United States remains hard to gauge.  GDP rose by 0.8% in 2002 Q3, much higher than expected three months ago.  But the strength can be largely traced to the impact of special incentives on automobile sales which provided a temporary boost to consumer spending. The Committee’s current projections for output growth and inflation are described below.  Based on the assumption that official interest rates are maintained at 4%, the central projection is that four-quarter growth in UK GDP is likely to settle around trend over the next two years, as the gradual improvement in global demand, continued strong growth in public spending, and a moderate recovery in business investment counterbalance some easing in consumer spending growth.  RPIX inflation is likely to rise above target in the coming months, reflecting the pattern of oil price movements and the effects of high house price inflation on housing depreciation.  As these unusual influences unwind, RPIX inflation may run slightly below the 2.5% target in the second year of the projection, but pick up very gradually to around target by the two-year horizon.  The medium-term outlook for inflation is marginally weaker than in August.  There remain a number of major risks and uncertainties around the central projection, principally stemming from international prospects and the outlook for UK consumer spending.  If they were to crystallise, these risks could have a material impact on UK inflation prospects.  Inflation Report: November 2002 50 High levels of secured borrowing are also supporting household demand, although consumer confidence has fallen markedly in recent months.  The sharp decline in equity wealth over the past year, weak labour market trends, and relatively subdued growth in household income may be weighing on confidence and spending plans.  The near-term outlook is for slower growth in consumer spending.  Moreover, any recovery in business investment is likely to be relatively sluggish, given little pressure on capacity and high levels of uncertainty which encourage companies to delay capital expenditure.  The Committee judges that US GDP growth will ease in the fourth quarter with a slowdown in consumer spending.  Thereafter, growth should strengthen gradually, underpinned by continued improvements in productivity and the low level of interest rates.  Taking the further easing of policy into account, the outlook is broadly similar to the August central projection. Output growth in the euro area remains sluggish, with little or no increase in domestic demand over the past year.  Consumer spending has risen only marginally over this period.  The recent pattern of household spending in the euro area is much weaker than in the United States or the United Kingdom, perhaps reflecting a combination of factors such as:  slower growth in real disposable income;  higher levels of unemployment, which may have depressed consumer confidence;  and a less buoyant housing market in the larger economies which has consequently provided less additional collateral to support a rise in household credit.  Moreover, the low level of construction investment in Germany following the post-reunification boom has exacerbated the contraction from the recent decline in the global demand for plant and machinery, and thus has amplified the investment cycle in the euro area.  The Committee continues to expect a modest recovery in euro-area GDP growth over the forecast period. But, reflecting the weaker-than-expected domestic demand outturns for this year, the prospective pick-up may be a little more muted than thought likely three months ago. There is little change to the outlook in the rest of the world. The most likely outcome in Japan is for a weak cyclical recovery;  prospects remain highly uncertain given the continuing challenge of non-performing loans.  Growth elsewhere in Asia held up relatively well during the global downswing, bolstered by robust domestic demand.  External demand nonetheless remains an important spur, and growth in the region is likely to strengthen further in line with the recovery in the major industrial economies. Drawing together the picture from different regions, the Committee continues to assume that there will be a gradual strengthening in UK-weighted world demand and trade over  Prospects for inflation 51 the forecast period, fostered by the stimulative stance of policy.  Annual global GDP growth is likely to return to around trend rates in the second year of the projection.  Taking into account the lower level of market interest rates, the global prospects are broadly similar to those in the August Report.  The upswing in the world economy is not yet durably entrenched, however, and there are downside risks to the global outlook.  Confidence in global equity markets remains fragile.  Moreover, in the United States, the high level of private sector debt and low rate of household saving continue to be sources of particular vulnerability.  Indeed, the drop in US consumer confidence in recent months could foreshadow a weaker outlook for household spending than currently envisaged, and that in turn could check the upward momentum in overall activity.  And, in the euro area, given only limited recovery in output growth to date and the absence of any sustained pick-up in domestic demand, there are risks of a renewed downturn in private sector confidence, which could prompt companies and households to rein back spending plans and thus prolong the period of below-trend growth. The most likely prospect for international prices has changed relatively little since August.  Oil prices rose during August and September, given heightened uncertainty regarding military conflict in Iraq and a possible disruption to supplies. But prices fell back in October as market concerns eased.  Oil futures prices, which are used to guide the Committee’s central projection, edge down over the next two years to around the levels expected three months ago.  The projection for non-oil commodity prices is little altered:  a stronger outlook for food prices is largely counterbalanced by a weaker picture for industrial commodities.  More broadly, global inflationary pressures are likely to remain subdued over the forecast period, given the prospect of only a moderate recovery in world output growth.  The outlook for the price of internationally traded goods and services is close to the August projection.  UK import prices also depend on the outlook for sterling exchange rates.  The sterling effective exchange rate index (ERI) has changed little over the past three months.  In the  1 5 working days to 6 November, the sterling ERI averaged 106.3.  That rate has been used as the starting point in the current projection.  It is consistent with bilateral rates of $1.55 and 63 pence against the euro, and is less than 1% above the level assumed in the August Report.  The sterling ERI is assumed to depreciate gently over the forecast period to 104.5 in 2004 Q4. UK equity prices have continued to track international developments closely.  Prices fell sharply in September, but  Inflation Report: November 2002 52 subsequently recaptured much of this additional loss as global markets have rallied in recent weeks.  In the 1 5 working days to 6 November, the FTSE All-Share index averaged 1 955, some 4% below the level for 2002 Q4 incorporated in the August projection.  Maintaining the conventional approach, equity wealth is assumed to rise in line with nominal GDP over the forecast period.   House prices have again risen more quickly than expected in recent months, with both the Halifax and Nationwide reporting increases in the 25%–30% region over the past year. The market remains very buoyant, although there are some tentative signs of moderation looking forward.  In particular, data on new housing reservations and loan approvals are running below levels earlier in the year.  This may herald some easing in activity, as recent price increases have increasingly stretched the affordability of houses in terms of average disposable income.  In the Committee’s central projection, house price inflation slows markedly, with prices broadly stable in two years’ time.  But there are major risks around the assumed path. The MPC’s projections continue to be based on the Government’s nominal public spending plans, which imply further robust growth in government expenditure over the forecast period.  In recent months, tax revenues have fallen short of expectations in the Budget.  In large part that appears to reflect the influence of weaker-than-expected economic growth and the impact of the slowdown on revenues linked to the financial services sector.  Based on recent outturns, the Committee has lowered the estimates of future tax revenue.   6.2 The output and inflation projections Output growth in the United Kingdom has continued to recover from the cyclical trough around the turn of the year. According to the preliminary ONS estimate, GDP rose by 0.7% in 2002 Q3, slightly above the revised estimate of growth in the second quarter.  However, recent monthly and quarterly data for production and demand have been affected by the timing of Easter and by the Jubilee holidays, which have clouded the assessment of trends.  Taken together, the Q2 and Q3 GDP estimates are consistent with a gradual rebound in output growth to around long-term trend rates.  Nevertheless, the pick-up in activity over the spring and summer appears somewhat weaker than assumed three months ago. Strong growth in consumer spending has provided the main support to GDP growth in the United Kingdom in recent years.  Robust spending has underpinned domestic demand and cushioned the impact of the recent global downturn. However, the resulting divergence between domestic and  Prospects for inflation 53 external demand has been reflected in uneven pressures on industrial sectors.  It has also been associated with a build-up of household debt to historically high levels in relation to income, which increases the risks of a sharp slowdown in household spending at some point.  Against this background, the outlook for consumer spending remains central to the overall assessment of future aggregate demand conditions. There are some signs of easing in consumer spending growth this year from the pace in 2001, adjusting for the impact of the timing of Easter and the Jubilee Bank Holidays which have affected the monthly and quarterly pattern of expenditure. But to date, the slowdown appears to be moderate and underlying spending growth remains quite strong.  Several factors point to near-term resilience in spending.  Real interest rates are low, and the sharp increase in house prices in recent years has enabled homeowners to borrow more cheaply and to withdraw substantial housing equity against the value of their additional collateral.  Unsecured borrowing is also growing very rapidly.  Unemployment has been maintained at historically low levels over the past year, and consumer confidence remains relatively high.  However, other influences continue to point to a slowdown in spending.  In particular, growth in real post-tax labour income has fallen from the rapid rates in recent years, and the sharp fall in equity prices this year has reduced household financial wealth considerably.   The Committee continues to expect a further slackening in the growth of consumer spending over the forecast period.  The recent strength of the housing market is likely to sustain growth in credit and spending for a while, with consumption decelerating more sharply as house price inflation slows. Moreover, real household income growth is likely to remain relatively subdued for some time, as employment growth falters, and as the increase in National Insurance Contributions in April 2003 reduces take-home pay.  And, although the links between equity prices and consumer spending are uncertain, the sharp drop in financial wealth over the past two years should encourage households to make additional savings over the forecast period in order to rebuild their balance sheet positions.  The central projection is that quarterly consumer spending growth will be relatively robust around the turn of the year, following a weak third quarter, but will then moderate through 2003 to a little below long-run trend rates.  Largely echoing changes to the assumed profile of house price inflation, consumer spending growth may be a little stronger in the first year of the projection than assumed in August, and a little weaker in the second year. Business investment remains depressed.  Investment has fallen in each of the past six quarters, and in 2002 Q2 capital spending was almost 1 1% down on levels a year earlier.  Inflation Report: November 2002 54 Cutbacks have been equally sharp across the manufacturing and service sectors.  There is little likelihood of an imminent turnaround in investment spending.  There are few signs of emerging strains on plant capacity:  although there are significant differences across sectors, capacity utilisation, on average, is marginally below normal levels.  And, although aggregate profits have edged up in recent quarters, capital gearing at market values has increased given the recent sharp fall in equity prices, which has added to pressure on corporate balance sheets. Internal funds for investment may also be lowered by additional payments to finance pension fund shortfalls brought about by falling equity values.  Moreover, uncertainty about the global recovery continues to provide companies with an incentive to postpone investment.  Reflecting these factors, investment intentions surveys have generally weakened over the past quarter.  The Committee’s central projection is that business investment will dip a little further in the second half of 2002, and will then pick up gradually thereafter. Although business investment may rise a little faster than GDP over the forecast period, the recovery in investment is likely to be restrained:  in particular, the level of business investment by the end of 2004 is expected to remain below the level at the end of 2000.  The trend in whole-economy investment is likely to continue to be a little stronger than that for business investment, primarily reflecting the vigorous growth in public sector investment incorporated in spending plans. Lower inventory investment subtracted significantly from aggregate demand in 2002 Q2.  Surveys of manufacturing firms, in particular, reported that companies were seeking to cut stock levels to lower financing costs and improve cash flow. In some cases, the shutdown in production in the Jubilee Bank Holiday week may have provided an opportunity for companies to meet final demand by reducing inventories.  The latest CBI Industrial Trends Survey suggests that the correction of manufacturing inventories may be drawing to an end, thus providing a one-off boost to total demand and output.  Combined with reports from the CBI Distributive Trades Survey suggesting that distribution firms added to stock levels, whole-economy inventory investment is likely to have supported GDP growth in 2002 Q3.  There is little sign from surveys or reports to the Bank’s Agents of any major imbalance in aggregate inventory holdings.  The Committee has consequently maintained the assumption that stock levels rise broadly in line with output over the forecast period. The monthly and quarterly pattern of trade flows has also been volatile this year.  Following a sharp bounceback in 2002 Q2, monthly data point to a fall in export volumes in the third quarter, suggesting that the Q2 outturn exaggerated the  Prospects for inflation 55 strength of the underlying recovery in international demand for UK goods.  Indeed, recent monthly outturns have been surprisingly low in relation to estimates of global demand and the relative prices of UK exports.  Although some of the unexplained weakness is likely to be erratic, the Committee judges that the low outturn may also signify a more depressed underlying position.  The Committee continues to expect a steady recovery in exports over the next two years, predicated on the assumption of a gradual strengthening in external markets.  Nevertheless, export prospects are less bright than assumed in the August Report, reflecting the combination of a weaker-than-expected starting level, and a slightly stronger profile for the sterling effective exchange rate. Import volumes have also been relatively weak in recent months and have fallen short of the level expected in the August Report.  Looking back over the past year, it appears that the lower-than-expected level of imports in relation to UK aggregate demand can largely be explained by the compositional changes within spending:  in particular, given the high proportion of capital goods that are imported, the steep fall in business investment is likely to have had a major counterpart in reduced imports.  Drawing on disaggregated information on the outlook for the main components of aggregate demand, import growth is likely to rise over the forecast period.  Moreover, import growth may rebound more quickly than export growth.  In consequence, following the erratic substantial positive contribution of net trade to GDP growth in 2002 Q2, net trade is likely to remain a brake on output growth over the next two years, although the restraint may fade by the end of the period as the global upswing gathers strength.  The Committee’s current projection for the four-quarter growth in GDP is shown in Chart 6.1.(1) It is based on the assumption that official interest rates are maintained at 4%.(2) Four-quarter growth in GDP recovered to 1.7% in 2002 Q3 from the low point of 1.0% in 2002 Q1.  On the central projection, four-quarter GDP growth is expected to pick up further to a little above long-run trend rates by early 2003, before settling around trend thereafter.  Robust household and public spending are likely to provide the main impetus to GDP growth over the next six months.  As consumer spending growth is then likely to slow, the steady upturn in global demand and the moderate recovery in business investment are expected to support the continued strong expansion in public spending, maintaining overall GDP growth around trend.  The central projection is broadly similar to the August projection, with growth a little stronger in the short run, and slightly Chart 6.1 Current GDP projection based on constant nominal interest rates at 4% + – Percentage increase in output on a year earlier 1998 99 2000 01 02 03 04 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for GDP growth  in the future.

(2) An alternative projection based on market interest rate expectations is shown in Chart 6.5 below.  Inflation Report: November 2002 56 weaker in the medium term.  The change in the profile for consumer spending largely accounts for the small difference.  As expected, RPIX inflation has bounced back from the low point of 1.5% in June.  Indeed, RPIX inflation averaged 2.0% in 2002 Q3, slightly higher than in Q2, and a little above the August central projection.  RPIX inflation has remained volatile and the underlying trend hard to determine, as the twelve-month rate has been buffeted by the emergence and subsequent unwinding of a number of temporary influences on the price of relatively erratic components such as seasonal food and petrol.  The rapid increase in house price inflation over the past year has also had a pronounced direct impact on the housing depreciation component.  The marked divergence between services and goods price inflation has persisted, related to differences in demand conditions as well as in productivity growth. The prospects for inflation depend on the pressures exerted by demand in relation to the sustainable supply capacity of the economy.  Previous Reports have spelled out the challenges and uncertainties involved in forming estimates of sustainable supply capacity.  Given little new information, the Committee has maintained the same assumption on the near-term growth in potential supply capacity as in the August Report.  Overall pay pressures remain subdued.  Whole-economy earnings growth per employee continues to run a little below 4% per annum, even though bonuses no longer appear to be falling and the downward impact on earnings growth from this source has come to an end.  Moreover, average pay settlements over the past year remain around 3%.  Underlying earnings growth may, however, be slightly higher than measured, as the delayed settlement for local government workers is not yet captured in the data.  Furthermore, average hours worked per head have fallen significantly over the past year, pressing down on total earnings:  pay per hour is consequently rising more quickly than pay per employee. Inflation expectations appear relatively well-anchored to the inflation target and seem unlikely to be a source of particular pressure on nominal earnings.  The outlook for real earnings growth depends on employers’ demand for labour in relation to the available supply, as well as on the growth of labour productivity.  There may have been a weakening in aggregate labour demand in recent months, as total hours worked have fallen, although the downward trend is likely to be exaggerated by the Jubilee holiday distortions.  In addition, LFS employment is rising less quickly.  Moreover, some surveys and reports from the Bank’s regional Agents indicate a marginal easing in recruitment difficulties, although  Prospects for inflation 57 the pattern is far from uniform, and any such slackening appears very small.  Indeed, unemployment remains stable at historically low levels.  Overall labour market conditions remain tight. Productivity growth per person has been exceptionally weak over the past 1 8 months or so, as LFS employment growth remained relatively resilient despite the slowdown in GDP growth.  Output per hour has held up better, as average hours worked have fallen, perhaps in part temporarily as firms have lowered overtime to reduce costs, but also perhaps reflecting a desire from some employees to work shorter hours and to seek part-time rather than full-time work.  In aggregate, employers have sought to retain labour and in some cases to expand their headcount, presumably on the assumption that the downturn would be relatively shallow and short-lived, and recognising that the costs of shedding labour and subsequently recruiting and retraining could be substantial in a tight market.  In addition, public sector recruitment has also increased over this period, helping to underpin demand.  Looking forward, projected growth in output at around trend rates would typically be associated with a steady increase in labour demand.  However, in the initial phase of recovery, companies are likely to be able to supply the extra output by working off any ‘hoarding’ of labour during the downswing, and by taking the opportunity to rebuild productivity to more normal levels. As a result, although public sector demand is likely to continue to rise given the planned expansion of public services, total numbers employed could be relatively little changed over the next year or so.  Given steady growth in the working-age population, labour market conditions could consequently ease slightly for a time. Drawing together the various influences on pay, nominal earnings growth is likely to edge up a little in the near term.  A number of factors are likely to provide some upward pressure: the payment of the delayed local authority settlement;  the current tightness of the labour market;  and the prospective rise in inflation outturns.  But the upward trend in earnings is unlikely to be sustained beyond 2003, as the projected slight easing in labour market conditions should help to contain any increase in pay pressure.  Unit wage costs may rise a little less quickly over the forecast period than over the past year, as the cyclical recovery in productivity growth is likely to exceed the pick-up in earnings growth.  But the benign implications for unit labour costs, which include employers’ social contributions and other non-wage employment costs in addition to wages, will be tempered by the increase in National Insurance contributions next year.  Moreover, in terms of the impact on prices, companies may well pay more attention to a smoothed or trend measure of unit labour costs which attaches less weight to cyclical fluctuations.   Inflation Report: November 2002 58 The Committee’s latest projection for the twelve-month RPIX inflation rate is presented in Chart 6.2.(1) The projection is based on the assumption that official interest rates are maintained at 4% over the forecast period.(2) It is shown alongside the August projection, which was also conditioned on interest rates remaining at 4% (see Chart 6.3). The central projection is that RPIX inflation is likely to move somewhat above target by the end of the year and may remain a little above target through much of 2003.  Inflation is then expected to edge down slightly and to run a little below the target, although inching up very gradually to around the target level by the two-year forecast horizon.  Two factors account for the near-term pick-up in RPIX inflation.  First, global oil prices in late 2002 are much higher than in late 2001, when prices dipped sharply in the aftermath of the 1 1 September terrorist attacks.  Second, the sharp increase in UK house price inflation continues to boost the housing depreciation component of RPIX.  Both influences are likely to be transitory. The twelve-month change in oil and petrol prices is likely to decline during 2003, and indeed may well reverse sign by the end of the year.  It is highly unlikely that house price inflation can persist for long at the current unsustainable pace.  So the projected near-term increase in RPIX inflation may exaggerate the strength of underlying inflationary pressure somewhat. Abstracting from these temporary influences, RPIX inflation appears likely to be broadly flat over the forecast period around the 2.5% target level.  Reflecting the prospect of UK GDP in broad balance with supply capacity, underlying Chart 6.3 RPIX inflation projection in August based on constant nominal interest rates at 4% 0 1 2 3 4 5 Percentage increase in prices on a year earlier 2.5 1998 99 2000 01 02 03 04 Chart 6.2 Current RPIX inflation projection based on constant nominal interest rates at 4% 0 1 2 3 4 5 Percentage increase in prices on a year earlier 2.5 1998 99 2000 01 02 03 04 The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for RPIX inflation in the future.  The darkest band includes the central (single most likely) projection and covers 10% of the probability.  Each successive pair of bands is drawn to cover a further 10% of probability, until 90% of the probability distribution is covered.  The bands widen as the time horizon is extended, indicating increasing uncertainty about outcomes.  See the box on pages 48–49 of the May 2002 Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents. (1) Also shown as Chart 2 in the Overview. (2) An alternative projection based on the assumption that interest rates follow market expectations is illustrated below in Chart 6.4.  Prospects for inflation 59 domestic inflationary pressures are expected to be relatively stable.  External influences on prices may be a little stronger than in the recent past, but are also expected to show no clear trend over the forecast period. Compared with the August projection, RPIX inflation is likely to be noticeably higher over the next year or so, principally reflecting the recent spike in oil prices and the direct effect, via the housing depreciation component, of the persistence of high house price inflation.  But inflation is expected to be marginally lower in the second year of the projection than in August, principally reflecting slightly softer external pressures on inflation. Financial market participants have again lowered their expectations of the likely level of official interest rates in the United Kingdom over the next two years.  Employing the  same approach as in previous Reports, and based on a  1 5 working-day average to 6 November, market expectations were consistent with the possibility of a slight reduction in official interest rates in the coming months, with the prospect of a reversal by the end of 2003 and a slight increase thereafter to around 41/2% by the end of 2004 (see Table 6.A). The Committee’s latest projections based on this interest  rate trajectory are shown in Charts 6.4 and 6.5.  The differences from the constant interest rate projections are negligible.  There remains considerable uncertainty surrounding the prospects for output growth and inflation.  The Committee has continued to calibrate the variance of the fan chart drawing on the experience of previous forecast errors.

Judgments about these risks consequently form a key consideration in gauging the appropriate level of interest rates. First, as outlined above, there is a risk that the world recovery could still falter.  A much weaker international outlook would have a substantial impact on the prospects for UK GDP growth and inflation. Second, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the outlook for consumer spending in the United Kingdom, which is closely linked to the prospects for the housing market. House price increases at current rates are clearly unsustainable.  The central projection incorporates a sharp slowdown in house price inflation, with prices broadly stable in two years’ time.  But there are large risks to this view.  Given current high levels of consumer confidence and low unemployment, there is a possibility that continued rapid house price inflation could persist for a time, fuelling a further expansion of household debt and supporting stronger consumer spending than in the central projection.  But the longer house prices rise at an unsustainable pace, and the larger the build-up of household debt, the greater the risk of a sharp correction at some point.  There are consequently both major upside and downside risks to the outlook for consumer spending and inflation arising from the potential instability in current housing market trends.

Because of the difficulties in precisely quantifying  low-probability events, probabilities of less than 5% are not shown  in this chart.  Prospects for inflation 61 Third, the Committee has maintained the view from previous Reports, that there is a risk that the pass-through into wages and prices of the increase in National Insurance contributions next year could be higher than in the central projection. There is a small upside risk to the central projection for inflation and a slight downside risk to the outlook for GDP growth from this source. The risks to the outlook are therefore substantial.  A material change in the prospects for the world economy or for the UK housing market could have a profound impact on UK inflation prospects.  But given the large and uncertain risks in both directions, the best collective judgment of the Committee is that the risks around the central projection from these factors are broadly balanced over the forecast period.  Reflecting the possible impact of the rise in National Insurance contributions, the Committee judges that, relative to the central projection, the overall risks to growth are weighted marginally to the downside, with those to inflation slightly on the upside.  The probabilities of various outcomes for RPIX inflation and GDP growth are presented in Charts 6.6 and 6.7 . The overall balance of risks to the inflation outlook at the  two-year horizon is illustrated in Chart 6.8, together with the corresponding balance in the August Report (see Chart 6.9). Bearing in mind the major uncertainties, individual Committee members hold a range of views on the overall balance of risks, although the range of opinion is relatively narrow.

Given that the central projection of inflation was close to target, and that the large and uncertain risks appeared at present to be in broad balance, the Committee voted to maintain the Bank’s repo rate at 4%.    Prospects for inflation 63 In October, the Bank asked a sample of external forecasters for their latest projections of inflation and output.  The average forecast for the twelve-month rate of RPIX inflation in 2002 Q4, based on the results of this survey, was 2.3% (with a range of 1.9% to 2.6%) rising to 2.4% in 2004 Q4 (with a range of 1.7% to 3.7%).  Compared with the survey results in the August Report, the average forecast for inflation at the  two-year horizon was slightly lower.  The distribution of the forecasters’ central projections has the greatest number of respondents expecting inflation to be between 2.1% and 2.4% (see Chart A).  In August, the most popular range was between 2.4% and 2.7%.  On average the external forecasters see a 64% probability of inflation being at or below 2.5% in 2004 Q4 (see the table below). The forecasters’ average projection for four-quarter GDP growth in 2002 Q4 was 2.1% (with a range of 1.6% to 2.5%), which was somewhat lower than the average forecast reported in August.  The average projection for GDP growth in 2004 Q4 was 2.6% (with a range of 2.2% to 3.5%). The average forecast for the official interest rate in 2002 Q4 was 4.0% (ranging from 3.8% to 4.5%), rising to 5.2% by 2004 Q4 (with a range of 4.5% to 5.9%).  The forecast for 2002 Q4 was slightly lower than the average forecast in August, but the forecast at the two-year horizon was unchanged.  On average, forecasters expect that the sterling ERI will be 105.4 in 2002 Q4 (ranging from 101.0 to 1 10.6), falling to 101.4 by 2004 Q4 (ranging from 95.0 to 1 10.7).

Arable yields were substantially above 2001 levels, contributing to continued weakness in cereals prices.     ● The recovery in manufacturing output remained slow and uneven.  Sub sectors such as civilian aerospace and telecommunications were still depressed, whereas companies producing goods for the public sector, construction or consumers reported increases in output.          ● Growth in construction output began to moderate and the balance of orders continued to shift away from commercial buildings to public sector projects.  Strong demand for new houses continued.  Though there was some easing in the secondary market for higher priced houses, there was no indication of slower demand for other types of property.  ● The picture for business services was mixed, with growth in many sectors contrasting with weakness in financial and related services in the London area.  Demand for consumer services continued to grow, although overcapacity was becoming evident for some leisure facilities.         ● Growth in consumer spending moderated slightly over the period and the outlook was more uncertain.  Sales of new cars were lower than expected in September stimulating manufacturers’ promotions the following month. Discounting of flights and hotel rooms had boosted demand for short breaks.   ● Growth in demand from some smaller export markets did not fully compensate for continued weakness in demand from Germany and the United States.  Import penetration continued to increase.   ● Low profitability, volatility in world equity markets and weaker confidence resulting from the threat of war with Iraq had led to renewed caution about investment among manufacturing and business services contacts.     ● Prices of some raw materials rose during the period, although weak global demand allowed buyers to limit the impact of increases through more efficient purchasing.  Some cost increases, such as insurance premia, were less easy to resist.  Manufacturing output prices and some professional fees were subject to downward pressure due to plentiful supply. ● Retail goods price inflation remained muted and prices of new and used cars continued to fall.  Prices of most consumer services, except rates for flights and hotel rooms, continued to rise.  ● The labour market eased slightly as autumn brought more redundancies.  But increased public sector employment contributed to continuing labour shortages in some localities.  Pay pressures remained subdued but total costs rose more substantially for employers who needed to increase pension fund contributions.      This publication is a summary of monthly reports compiled by the Bank of England’s Agents, following discussions with around 2,000 businesses in the period between mid-July and mid-October.  It provides information on the state of business conditions, from firms across all sectors of the economy.  The report does not represent the Bank’s own views, nor does it represent the  views of any particular firm or region.  The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee uses the intelligence provided by the Agents,  in conjunction with information from other sources, to assist its understanding and assessment of current economic conditions. November 2002 (1) The Bank of England has Agencies for Central Southern England, the East Midlands, Greater London, the North East, the North West,  Northern Ireland, Scotland, the South East & East Anglia, the South West, Wales, the West Midlands, and Yorkshire & the Humber.  Inflation Report: November 2002 66 OUTPUT Primary production Agricultural output continued to increase.  Substantially higher yields from the domestic cereals harvest than in 2001, and increasing competition from imports, contributed to prices remaining at long-term lows. Prices for potatoes and other root vegetables were also depressed, in some cases significantly below production costs.  Agencies reported that, as a result, many farmers would cease to grow potatoes.  Restocking of beef and lamb following the end of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) continued, generally to numbers slightly below pre-FMD levels.  Exports of livestock have not yet recovered to  pre-2001 levels.   Manufacturing The gradual and patchy recovery in manufacturing output continued.  Companies producing for the  public sector, for construction, or goods for the consumer were generally seeing some growth in output. Demand for household goods and for processed, chilled and frozen foods continued to increase.  And manufacturers of luxury goods increased their output. Manufacturers of specialist safety equipment benefited from health and safety legislation and insurers’ requirements.  However, increasing import penetration limited the gains from extra demand.  Contacts also reported increasing pressure from customers for stock  to be held by suppliers, as deferral of delivery of orders by customers became more common.  UK manufacturing capacity continued to contract as multinational companies rationalised their production sites, increasingly moving factories to China, eastern  Europe, or consolidating production into fewer European plants. Overcapacity in printing continued.  Expected recoveries in production of chemicals and plastics failed to materialise.  Orders for machine tools and capital goods generally remained weak, and the civilian aerospace and telecommunications sectors showed little sign of recovery. Construction and housing Prospects for construction output have softened since the previous Agents’ Summary.  Current activity remained high, but orders were weaker.  Little work on new commercial buildings was started, unless fully  pre-let, even though investor demand for office and industrial property continued to rise.  Demand for new distribution sheds and development and refurbishment of retail and leisure property remained strong.  However, the balance of activity was shifting more to public sector work on schools, hospitals, social housing, flood protection and transport infrastructure.  Some Private Finance Initiative projects continued to experience long gestation periods.    Growth in house building continued to be constrained by shortages of suitable land and labour.  Strong demand was maintained, with many properties selling before they were built.  In the secondary housing market, some easing in demand for the highest priced properties was apparent, but in most regions there was no indication of slower demand for mid-market properties, or from  first-time buyers.    Services Growth in output of business services remained positive overall, but performance was dependent on the nature  of the customer.  Outsourcing of work, such as recruitment and legal services by the public sector,  was underpinning strong growth for some companies. Those providing services to manufacturing were facing reduced orders, particularly for functions such as maintenance of plant, as production moved overseas  and companies deferred inessential spending. Warehousing demand at ports was in some cases at record levels, reflecting buoyant imports, especially from the Far East. Weak private sector demand was reported in sectors  such as IT services and marketing.  Investment banking and related financial services were particularly subdued in London.  Accountants reported a modest increase  in demand for insolvency and personal bankruptcy  work.          Corporate expenditure on conference facilities, contract catering, taxis, car-hire and international courier services remained depressed.  Business travellers also appeared to be cutting costs by lowering spending on corporate credit cards and increasing use of discount airlines and budget hotels. Demand for consumer services continued to grow but there were signs of overcapacity in some regions in leisure facilities, such as restaurants and fitness clubs. Bookings of long-haul holidays remained below last year’s levels, although travel services as a whole saw some growth.  Housing-related services, such as estate agencies, mortgage providers and solicitors, reported continued buoyant year-on-year growth in volume and value of business.   Agents’ summary of business conditions 67 DEMAND Consumption The rate of growth in consumer spending appeared to have eased somewhat, albeit from strong figures earlier in the year.  Spending on home entertainment electrical goods and garden centre products remained buoyant.   Although early spending on Christmas merchandise was higher than a year ago, retail contacts were nervous that consumer confidence and spending would weaken rapidly if war broke out in the Middle East. Total sales of new cars in the September new registration month were lower than a year earlier, although manufacturers’ promotions succeeded in boosting sales in October.  Over the period, only prestige marques recorded significant growth in sales.  Contacts suggested that a significant proportion of car purchases was financed through mortgage equity withdrawal. The pattern of spending on leisure services was difficult to read.  Demand for short breaks, both in the United Kingdom and European cities, grew strongly but was probably influenced by discounting of flights and rooms. Growth in membership of fitness clubs appeared to be slowing, and some restaurants reported lower average spending per meal in recent weeks.  However, there was little evidence of declining spending in pubs, and spending at tourist attractions was boosted by good weather in September.         Exports and imports There was some growth in exports to the Far East, notably China, Taiwan and South Korea;  and eastern Europe. Demand from the Middle East and Australia also increased.  However, this was insufficient to compensate for a depressed German export market, only a slight upturn from the United States, and business lost to competitors from low-wage economies.  The weaker dollar also lowered margins on US sales.  Optimism about exports in 2003 rose, although an outbreak of hostilities with Iraq would dampen prospects. Import penetration increased further.  German manufacturers targeted the UK market to compensate for weak demand domestically.  And some UK-based companies switched from manufacturing products themselves to sourcing from China or eastern Europe.          Investment The climate for investment has deteriorated since the previous Agents’ Summary.  Cash conservation has increasingly been prioritised, following falls in world equity markets and low profitability.  Weakening confidence resulting from geopolitical uncertainty also led many firms to postpone investment.  In some cases funds earmarked for investment projects were diverted to top up company pension schemes.   Investment in extra capacity by larger manufacturing companies was often directed overseas, to economies with lower labour costs.  Within the United Kingdom, capital expenditure failed to keep pace with depreciation in many cases and some businesses were restricting investment to what was necessary to comply with health and safety legislation.  Projects with substantial and quick paybacks were proceeding, often involving increased automation to reduce labour costs. Agencies reported that many business services companies were deferring capital expenditure due to uncertainty about future levels of demand from their manufacturing customers.  Consumer services companies, however, continued to invest in refurbishment and upgrading of premises in order to retain or improve market share.       COSTS AND PRICES Input prices Contacts continued to report that prices of a variety of raw materials rose during 2002, mitigated in part by changed purchasing practices as weak global demand increased buyers’ negotiating power.  Contacts were increasingly concerned about rising overhead costs.  The most significant increases were in public, product and employers’ liability insurance premia, with the prospect of further substantial rises in the coming year.  Security costs also continued to rise due to insurer requirements or contacts’ own perception of a need for greater protection. Output prices Plentiful supply, increased competition through expanding use of on-line auctions, and customers’ demands for discounts continued to exert downward pressure on manufacturing output prices.  Some manufacturers of niche or luxury products, or those with a dominant market share, were able to raise prices on renewal of contracts, or increase margins on new lines. Most manufacturers, however, were subject to increased competition, including from imports, and had to concede small annual price reductions.  Retailers expected manufacturers to fund an increasing  Inflation Report: November 2002 68 proportion of multibuy promotions, and fashion suppliers were under pressure to concede discounts, because autumn stock had not been selling well in the shops. Service sector output prices continued to rise overall, although there was less upward pressure on some professional fee rates, for example as competition increased among providers of standard accountancy services.  However, consultancy and legal fees continued to increase, by around 5% annually in most cases. Cleaning and security contractors were increasing their prices to reflect an increase in the National Minimum Wage (NMW) to £4.20 in October.                     Retail prices Consumer goods price inflation remained muted with prices of electrical goods continuing to fall.  Weak sales of clothing due to unseasonably warm weather in September resulted in deeper discounting and earlier starts to some mid-season sales.  Contacts reported intensified competitive pressure between supermarkets and the re-emergence of loss leaders.  Use of two-for-one offers increased in health and beauty products, as well as food.   Agencies reported that new car prices were lower  year-on-year.  This had a knock-on effect on prices of used cars, which were already falling as a result of high stock levels.   Price inflation for consumer services continued to reflect increased labour costs.  Price increases of more than 3%, compared with a year earlier, were reported for pub and restaurant meals, theatre tickets, hairdressing, and car leasing and servicing.  Hotel room rates in parts of the United Kingdom had been discounted to boost occupancy rates.  Air fares also fell year-on-year as a result of increased competition. Pay Settlements remained subdued, except in areas of significant skills shortages.  Pay awards in manufacturing were mostly around 2% to 3%, and slightly higher in services, between 2.5% to 4%.  Higher settlements were made where retention of scarce skills was an issue.  Some graduate starting salaries, in areas such as IT, were lower than in Autumn 2001.  There were continued reports of pay freezes and deferral of settlements in both manufacturing and services companies.  Other factors caused total employment costs to rise. Falls in investment values led many employers to review their pension funds, with reports of increases of between 3% and 5% in employer contributions.  Some employers also faced pressure to restore pay differentials following the increase in the NMW.  Firms adjusting pay to meet the increased NMW were mainly outside the South East and included those in cleaning, security, retail, leisure and care.         EMPLOYMENT Another wave of job cuts in manufacturing and professional services companies took effect during the autumn.  This was particularly the case for professional services in London and the South East as the anticipated upturn in mergers and acquisitions work failed to materialise.  Non-replacement of staff choosing to leave or retiring has become a standard policy for contacts in a growing number of areas.  More generally, job creation in the private sector slowed because of uncertainty about future demand.  Evidence of easing in the market included lower voluntary turnover rates among staff and a significantly higher number of applications per advertised vacancy. However, increased public sector employment, notably  in administration, education and health, contributed  to continued labour shortages in some localities. Employment in leisure services, retail and call centres also continued to increase, partly as a result of longer opening hours.  But contacts reported that it remained difficult to recruit for jobs that require working in the evenings and/or weekends.  In some regions of continued labour market tightness, contacts were recruiting from abroad, to acquire specialist skills or simply to ensure adequate levels of low-skilled labour.

2011-05-11,"Inflation Report May 2011   BANK OF ENGLAND Inflation Report May 2011 In order to maintain price stability, the Government has set the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) a target for the annual inflation rate of the Consumer Prices Index of 2%. Subject to that, the MPC is also required to support the Government’s objective of maintaining high and stable growth and employment. The Inflation Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff under the guidance of the members of the Monetary Policy Committee.  It serves two purposes.  First, its preparation provides a comprehensive and forward-looking framework for discussion among MPC members as an aid to our decision making.  Second, its publication allows us to share our thinking and explain the reasons for our decisions to those whom they affect. Although not every member will agree with every assumption on which our projections are based, the fan charts represent the MPC’s best collective judgement about the most likely paths for inflation and output, and the uncertainties surrounding those central projections. This Report has been prepared and published by the Bank of England in accordance with  section 18 of the Bank of England Act 1998.

Financial markets were relatively resilient in the face of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami and the political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa.  Market participants lowered their expectations of the near-term path of Bank Rate.  The sterling effective exchange rate fell slightly, but remained within its range of the past two years.  UK banks continued to make steady progress in replacing maturing funding.  Bank lending to businesses declined again, and the availability of bank credit to households and smaller businesses remained tight.  Money growth was weak.   Demand The world economy continued to grow at a solid pace, but some recent indicators were more mixed and risks remain.  The recovery in the euro area was maintained, although market concerns about the fiscal sustainability of some euro-area periphery countries intensified.  US unemployment declined, but GDP growth slowed in 2011 Q1 and significant headwinds persist.  Activity in emerging economies grew robustly, although several tightened policy in response to heightened inflationary pressures and growth is likely to slow modestly as a consequence.  UK exports have grown briskly over the past year and business surveys pointed to continued strong growth. CPI inflation remained well above the 2% target but the recent weakness in underlying output growth persisted.  The recovery in the world economy was maintained and is expected to support growth in the United Kingdom, as should the considerable stimulus from monetary policy and the current level of sterling.  But the continuing squeeze on households’ real incomes is likely to weigh on demand, especially over the next year or so.  Further ahead, the chances of four-quarter GDP growth being either above or below its historical average rate are judged to be roughly balanced.   CPI inflation is likely to rise further this year and is more likely than not to remain above the target throughout 2012.  The near-term profile is markedly higher than in February, largely reflecting renewed increases in energy prices.  Inflation is likely to fall through 2012 into 2013 as the impact of external price pressures and the increase in VAT dissipates and some downward pressure from a margin of spare capacity persists.  But the timing and extent of that decline in inflation are both highly uncertain.  Under the assumptions that Bank Rate moves in line with market interest rates and the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remains at  £200 billion, the chances of inflation being above or below the target in the medium term are judged to be about the same.   6 Inflation Report  May 2011 At home, private domestic demand growth slowed sharply in 2010 Q4, in part disrupted by heavy snow.  During 2010, private domestic spending grew moderately, largely driven by higher corporate spending, including a material boost from stockbuilding.  In contrast, consumer spending stagnated as real incomes fell, reflecting subdued wage growth and the impact of the lower level of sterling and higher commodity prices on import prices.  The contrasting fortunes of the household and corporate sectors continued into 2011: households’ purchasing power is likely to have fallen further, and surveys suggest that households’ confidence was somewhat weaker than that of businesses.  Imports grew rapidly during 2010, despite the rise in import prices relative to domestic prices.   The fiscal consolidation continued.  The Committee’s projections are conditioned on the tax and spending plans set out in the March Budget, which were little changed relative to the previous plans.   The outlook for GDP growth Despite the rebound in activity following the heavy snow at the end of last year, GDP was provisionally estimated by the ONS to have risen by only 0.5% in 2011 Q1.  That was a weaker outturn than expected in the February Report, accounted for by a reported large fall in construction output. Business surveys and the growth in employment over recent months suggest that underlying activity may have been stronger than indicated by official output data.   Chart 1 shows the Committee’s best collective judgement for four-quarter GDP growth, assuming that Bank Rate follows a path implied by market interest rates and the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remains at £200 billion.  The projection during the first half of the forecast period is weaker than in February, reflecting the dampening effects of both further increases in energy prices and recent disappointing outturns for productivity on households’ future real labour incomes and hence consumption.  Fiscal consolidation is likely to continue to weigh on activity throughout the forecast period.  But the considerable stimulus from monetary policy, together with strong growth in global demand and the current level of sterling, should support recovery by shoring up private sector spending and encouraging a rebalancing of the economy towards exports and away from imports. There are some key uncertainties surrounding the likely strength of the recovery.  Private domestic demand growth could be boosted if more of the historically large corporate financial surpluses were spent on capital investment or transferred to households in the form of higher wages or dividends.  But there are significant downside risks to consumers’ expenditure.  In particular, some households may cut their spending further if they are still adjusting to past falls 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 2007 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 Percentage increases in output on a year earlier + – Projection Bank estimates of past growth ONS data Chart 1 GDP projection based on market interest rate expectations and £200 billion asset purchases The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for GDP growth.  It has been conditioned on the assumption that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remains at £200 billion throughout the forecast period.  To the left of the first vertical dashed line, the distribution reflects the likelihood of revisions to the data over the past;  to the right, it reflects uncertainty over the evolution of GDP growth in the future.  If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that the mature estimate of GDP growth would lie within the darkest central band on only 10 of those occasions.  The fan chart is constructed so that outturns are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter green areas on 10 occasions.  In any particular quarter of the forecast period, GDP is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fan on 90 out of 100 occasions.  And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions GDP growth can fall anywhere outside the green area of the fan chart.  Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey background.  In any quarter of the forecast period, the probability mass in each pair of identically coloured bands sums to 10%.  The distribution of that 10% between the bands below and above the central projection varies according to the skew at each quarter, with the distribution given by the ratio of the width of the bands below the central projection to the bands above it.  In Chart 1, the probabilities in the lower bands are slightly larger than those in the upper bands at Years 1, 2 and 3. See the box on page 39 of the November 2007 Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents. The second dashed line is drawn at the two-year point of the projection.  Overview 7 in their real incomes or to the uncertain economic outlook. That uncertainty may be especially pronounced for those households most exposed to the effects of the fiscal consolidation.  The extent to which net trade improves will depend on the durability of the expansion in world demand and on the degree and pace of rebalancing prompted by sterling’s past depreciation.   There remains a wider than usual range of views among Committee members about the outlook for growth.  The Committee judges that relative to the most likely path — contained within the darkest band in Chart 1 — the risks to growth are skewed to the downside.  Taking into account that skew, the Committee’s best collective judgement is that GDP growth is likely to be below its historical average rate over the next year or so.  Thereafter, growth is about as likely to be above its historical average rate as below it.   Chart 2 shows the distribution for the level of GDP corresponding to the Committee’s growth projection, which is somewhat lower than in February.  The Committee continues to judge it likely that some margin of spare capacity, although diminishing, will persist throughout the forecast period. Costs and prices CPI inflation was 4.0% in March.  That elevated rate of inflation reflects the temporary impacts of three factors:  the increase in VAT to 20%;  higher energy prices;  and higher import prices.  Recent increases in the prices of energy and other commodities are likely to put further upward pressure on inflation as they work through the supply chain.  These cost pressures were evident in manufacturers’ output prices. Some measures of households’ near-term and longer-term inflation expectations increased further, although the increases in near-term expectations over the past year were less than the upward revision to the MPC’s own view of near-term inflation. In contrast, longer-term inflation expectations of professional forecasters and those implied by financial market prices were stable.    Labour productivity has been broadly unchanged since the middle of 2010, some way below its historical trend path.  That might suggest that the degree of spare capacity within companies has increased and that there is considerable scope for rapid productivity growth in the future.  In contrast, survey evidence points to a more limited amount of spare capacity within companies.  Unemployment remained broadly unchanged at an elevated level.  Private sector regular pay growth was muted, at close to 2%, reflecting both weak productivity growth and continuing slack in the labour market. The outlook for inflation Chart 3 shows the Committee’s best collective judgement for the outlook for CPI inflation, based on the same assumptions 300 310 320 330 340 350 360 370 380 390 400 2007 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 £ billions 0 ONS data Bank estimates of past level Projection Chained-volume measure (reference year 2006).  See the footnote to Chart 1 for details of the assumptions underlying the projection for GDP growth.  The width of this fan over the past has been calibrated to be consistent with the four-quarter growth fan chart, under the assumption that revisions to quarterly growth are independent of the revisions to previous quarters.  Over the forecast, the mean and modal paths for the level of GDP are consistent with Chart 1.  So the skews for the level fan chart have been constructed from the skews in the four-quarter growth fan chart at the one, two and three-year horizons.  This calibration also takes account of the likely path dependency of the economy, where, for example, it is judged that shocks to GDP growth in one quarter will continue to have some effect on GDP growth in successive quarters.  This assumption of path dependency serves to widen the fan chart.

The dashed line is drawn at the two-year point.  8 Inflation Report  May 2011 as Chart 1.  There is a good chance that inflation will reach 5% later this year and it is more likely than not to remain above the 2% target throughout 2012, boosted by the increase in VAT, higher energy and import prices, and some rebuilding of companies’ margins.  The projection over that period is markedly higher than in February, mainly reflecting the recent increases in energy prices, including the likelihood that they will lead to higher utility bills.  Inflation is likely to fall back through 2012 and into 2013 as the temporary impact of those factors raising inflation wanes and some downward pressure from spare capacity persists.  The extent of that fall is likely to be moderated by upward pressure on nominal wages, as the continuing squeeze in real wages is resisted and inflation expectations drift up further.  The prospects for inflation remain highly uncertain. Domestically, the degree of spare capacity and its dampening impact on inflation will depend on:  the strength of demand; the growth of productivity;  the performance of the labour market;  and the sensitivity of wages to labour market slack. There is also considerable uncertainty about the strength of the forces opposing the impact of spare capacity.  The magnitude of both the squeeze on real wages and the overshoot of the inflation target are exceptional, so it is hard to be sure how households and companies will respond. Externally, continued strong global growth may increase the upward pressure on import prices, particularly those of commodities.  And plausible alternative paths for domestic utility prices would have significant implications for the inflation outlook. The range of views among Committee members over the outlook for inflation is wider than usual.  In the current uncertain environment, modest differences in judgements regarding the factors above can have a material impact on the outlook.  On balance, the Committee’s best collective judgement, based on the monetary policy assumptions described above, is that the chances of inflation being either above or below the 2% inflation target in the medium term are roughly equal (Chart 4).   The policy decision At its May meeting, the Committee judged that the pace of recovery was more likely than not to pick up from its recent soft patch.  The near-term outlook for inflation had worsened further, primarily reflecting renewed increases in energy prices. But under the assumption that Bank Rate rose in line with market yields, inflation was still likely to fall back in the medium term, as the temporary impacts of the factors currently raising inflation diminished and some downward pressure from a margin of spare capacity persisted.  In the  light of that outlook, the Committee judged it appropriate at that meeting to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5% and the stock  of purchased assets at £200 billion, in order to meet the  2% CPI inflation target over the medium term.  0 20 40 60 80 100 12 13 14 Per cent Q2 Q2 Q2 Q2 2011 Q3 Q3 Q3 Q4 Q4 Q4 Q1 Q1 Q1 February Inﬂation Report  May Inﬂation Report  The May and February swathes in this chart are derived from the same distributions as  Chart 3 and Chart 5.4 on page 39 respectively.  They indicate the assessed probability of inflation being above target in each quarter of the forecast period.  The width of the swathe at each point in time corresponds to the width of the band of the fan chart in which the target falls in that quarter, or, if the target falls outside the coloured area of the fan chart, the width of the band closest to the target.  The bands in the fan chart illustrate the MPC’s best collective judgement that inflation will fall within a given range.  The swathes in Chart 4 show the probability within the entire band of the corresponding fan chart of inflation being close to target;  the swathes should not therefore be interpreted as a confidence interval.  The dashed line is drawn at the two-year point of the May projection.  The two-year point of the February projection was one quarter earlier. Chart 4 An indicator of the probability inflation will be above the target  1 Money and asset prices Section 1 Money and asset prices 9 Between the February and May Reports, interest rate expectations fell back a little (Section 1.1) and there were only modest movements in most financial market prices (Section 1.2).  UK banks issued a substantial amount of debt in early 2011 (Section 1.3) and there was some improvement in credit conditions between the February and May Reports (Section 1.4).  Aggregate broad money growth remained weak compared with pre-crisis rates (Section 1.5).   1.1 Monetary policy The MPC maintained Bank Rate at 0.5% and the stock of purchased assets financed by central bank reserves remained at £200 billion.  The reasons behind the MPC’s decisions in March and April are discussed in the box on page 10. Market participants’ interest rate expectations for the next three years, implied by overnight index swap (OIS) rates, were a little lower in the fifteen working days to 4 May than at the time of the February Report (Chart 1.1).  On average, market participants expected Bank Rate to increase to around 0.8% in 2011 Q4 and to rise by around a percentage point in each of the following two years.  Most respondents to the Reuters survey of economists expected Bank Rate to increase first in 2011 Q3.  Since the February Report, Reuters have asked respondents when they expect the MPC to begin asset sales. In the latest survey, around two thirds of respondents expected asset sales to begin in either 2012 or 2013. At its April meeting, the European Central Bank (ECB) Governing Council increased the key ECB interest rates by 0.25 percentage points.  In the United States, the Federal Open The MPC maintained Bank Rate at 0.5% and the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at £200 billion.  Market participants’ expectations for the future path of Bank Rate were a little lower than at the time of the February Report.  In general, financial markets continued to function normally, despite developments in the Middle East and North Africa and the Japanese earthquake and tsunami.  But market concerns about the fiscal positions of some euro-area periphery countries intensified.  UK banks’ debt issuance was strong in early 2011, but further substantial issuance will be required during the remainder of 2011 and beyond to replace maturing debt.  Some indicators pointed to a modest improvement in credit conditions, although conditions remained restrictive for households and some businesses.  Bank lending to businesses and households remained weak in 2011 Q1.

(a) The February 2011 and May 2011 curves are estimated using OIS rates in the fifteen working days to 9 February 2011 and 4 May 2011 respectively.  10 Inflation Report  May 2011 Monetary policy since the February Report The MPC’s central projection in the February Report, under the assumptions that Bank Rate followed a path implied by market interest rates and that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remained at £200 billion, was that growth was likely to resume following the contraction in output at the end of 2010.  Under the same assumptions, the MPC judged that inflation was likely to rise further above the 2% target in 2011 before falling back.  But the extent and timing of that fall were uncertain. At the time of the MPC’s meeting on 9–10 March, it was too early to assess the extent to which activity had recovered since the slowdown in growth at the end of 2010.  Evidence from the latest business surveys pointed to some recovery.  By contrast, indicators of consumer spending and sentiment had been much weaker.  The available data had remained consistent with buoyant growth in global activity continuing into the first quarter of 2011. CPI inflation had risen to 4.0% in January.  That elevated rate of inflation reflected higher energy and other commodity prices, the increase in the VAT rate and the past depreciation of sterling.  A substantial development during the month had been the increase in oil prices, reflecting heightened political tension in the Middle East and North Africa.  Unless the increase in the oil price was quickly reversed, inflation was likely to rise further above target in the near term than had been previously expected.  Higher oil prices related to supply concerns might also be expected to worsen global growth prospects. Overall, recent developments had appeared to increase uncertainty over the medium-term outlook for both activity and inflation.  Nevertheless, the balance between the downside and upside risks to the medium-term inflation outlook had probably not shifted significantly over the month. On the downside, continued weakness in activity, relative to the supply capacity of the economy, could cause inflation to fall materially below the target in the medium term.  On the upside, inflation could remain elevated for longer than the Committee expected if the period of persistently above-target inflation in the near term caused expectations of higher future inflation to become ingrained.  Inflation might also remain above the target if externally generated pressures continued or if there were further pass-through from the past depreciation of sterling. For some members, the upside risks to the medium-term inflation outlook meant that the case for an immediate withdrawal of some of the current monetary stimulus remained compelling.  Other members concluded that an increase in Bank Rate was not yet appropriate.  There remained merit in waiting to see how developments in the oil market and household spending evolved before altering the stance of monetary policy.  For one member, the balance of risks continued to warrant an expansion of monetary policy, because it was likely that inflation would fall below target in the medium term. Six members of the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%.  Two members voted for a 25 basis point rise in Bank Rate and one member voted for a 50 basis point increase. Eight members voted to keep the stock of asset purchases at £200 billion.  One member preferred to increase the size of the programme by £50 billion. Indicators received over the course of the month leading up to the MPC’s meeting on 6–7 April still did not provide clear guidance about the extent to which activity had recovered following the slowdown at the end of 2010.  Despite the natural disasters in Japan and continued unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, movements in asset prices had been limited and normal trading conditions had quickly returned in most financial markets. Although CPI inflation had fallen from 4.4% in February to 4.0% in March, recent movements in the prices of energy, imported commodities and other goods indicated that the most likely near-term path of inflation would be higher than at the time of the February Report.  The most recent indicators of inflation expectations had been mixed. The risks to medium-term inflation in both directions were substantial.  The key risk to the downside still surrounded the outlook for private final demand.  The key upside risks related to inflation expectations and global price pressures.  Overall, the balance of risks had not changed sufficiently over the month for Committee members to change their views of the appropriate stance of policy. Six members of the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%.  Two members voted for a 25 basis point rise in Bank Rate and one member voted for a 50 basis point increase. Eight members voted to keep the stock of asset purchases at £200 billion.  One member preferred to increase the size of the programme by £50 billion. At its meeting on 4–5 May, the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%.  The Committee also voted to maintain the stock of asset purchases financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at £200 billion.  Section 1 Money and asset prices 11 Market Committee continued with its programme of asset purchases, which was announced in November.  1.2 Financial markets A number of events since the February Report might have been expected to affect asset prices and increase financial market uncertainty.  Those included heightened political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa and the Japanese earthquake and tsunami on 11 March.  Despite those events, financial markets generally continued to operate normally with little sign of excessive volatility.  Measures of uncertainty related to oil and equity prices increased somewhat during the second half of February and in March, but they subsequently fell back (Chart 1.2).  And other measures of uncertainty, such as those for short-term interest rates and foreign exchange, did not rise. These relatively modest movements in measures of uncertainty contrast with the sharp movements in 2008 and the first half of 2010, relating to the financial crisis and euro-area periphery sovereign debt concerns respectively.  The more limited impact of recent events could indicate that market participants perceive them to be less significant for asset prices, but it is also possible that financial markets have become more resilient.  The remainder of this subsection discusses developments in a range of asset prices.  Government bonds Market concerns about the fiscal positions of some euro-area periphery countries have intensified in recent months.  There have been several developments since the February Report.  In late March, the European Council met to consider a package of measures, including an increase in the effective lending capacity of the temporary European Financial Stability Facility and the establishment of the permanent European Stability Mechanism from 2013, both of which are expected to be finalised by the end of June.  The Irish banking sector stress-test results, released at the end of March, suggested that an additional €24 billion of capital would be needed by the Irish banking sector.  And in early May, Portugal agreed a €78 billion support package with European authorities and the IMF. Government bond yields in Greece, Ireland and Portugal have all increased relative to German government bond yields in recent months.  Spreads on Spanish government debt — which rose following events in the first half of 2010 — appear to have been less affected by recent events, and in the run-up to the May Report were at a similar level to three months earlier (Chart 1.3).  UK ten-year government bond yields were a little lower than at the time of the February Report and remained at historically low levels.  The low level of bond yields has been driven by Chart 1.2 Indicators of market uncertainty 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 2008 09 10 11 Equities(a) Foreign   exchange(c) Short-term   interest rates(d) Oil prices(b) Indices:  2 January 2008 = 100 February Report  Sources:  Bloomberg, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, NYSE Euronext and Bank calculations.

Corporate bonds and equities Over the period since the February Report as a whole, there has been little change in corporate bond and equity prices. Non-financial companies’ bond yields fell slightly, although spreads over comparable-maturity government bond yields were broadly flat.  The FTSE All-Share index was at a similar level in the fifteen working days to 4 May as in the period leading up to the February Report.  Equity prices were also broadly unchanged in the euro area, but rose a little in the United States.  Japanese equity prices fell by more than 15% after the earthquake and tsunami, but prices subsequently recovered somewhat, and in the fifteen working days to 4 May were 9% lower than three months earlier (Chart 1.5).   Exchange rates The sterling ERI was around 2% lower than at the time of the February Report.  That reflected a 4% depreciation against the euro — which is likely to have reflected, in part, market participants’ anticipation of the ECB’s policy tightening in April — partly offset by an appreciation against the US dollar.  In the run-up to the May Report, the sterling ERI stood around 25% lower than in mid-2007 (Chart 1.6).  In the days following the Japanese earthquake and tsunami on 11 March, the yen appreciated sharply.  But on 18 March, G7 Finance Ministers announced co-ordinated intervention in foreign exchange markets, and the yen subsequently depreciated.  In the run-up to the May Report, the yen ERI was around 3% lower than three months earlier.  1.3 The banking sector The sustainability and strength of the recovery in the UK economy will depend, in part, on developments in the banking sector.  In aggregate, UK banks improved their capital ratios during 2010, but banks continue to face challenges, including the need to replace a significant amount of maturing wholesale funding.  The Independent Commission on Banking published its interim report on 11 April.  The report set out a number of recommendations aimed at:  making banks better able to absorb losses;  making it easier and less costly to sort out banks that get into trouble;  and curbing incentives for excessive risk-taking.(2) Capital UK banks have increased their core capital ratios significantly since 2007, despite experiencing losses during the recession. Most increased those ratios during 2010 through both earnings (1) See the discussion on page 11 of the February 2011 Report.

But banks, in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, will need to increase capital ratios further, in part in response to regulatory developments.   Banks’ willingness to lend will depend, in part, on their assessment of the credit risk associated with lending.  And the performance of past loans may affect that assessment. Write-off rates on lending to UK corporates remained elevated at the end of 2010.  The rise in the write-off rate during the recession appears large relative to the limited increase in the corporate liquidations rate (Chart 1.7).  That might indicate that banks have faced a larger proportion of losses from companies that have not entered formal insolvency procedures.  It is also possible that banks have faced significant losses from a relatively small number of companies with large amounts of debt.   As discussed in previous Reports, developments in the commercial real estate sector continue to pose a risk to banks’ balance sheets.  Commercial property values remain around 35% below their mid-2007 peak and a significant number of commercial property loans are in breach of loan to value conditions.  Market contacts remain concerned that a deterioration in income streams or increases in debt-servicing costs could reduce borrowers’ ability to service their debts and could in turn reduce banks’ willingness and ability to continue to show forbearance.  Banks have, however, made provisions against future losses on commercial property where there is clear evidence to suggest losses will occur, and so any impact on their balance sheets will depend on the extent to which those provisions prove insufficient. Funding During 2010, major UK lenders replaced a substantial amount of maturing wholesale funding by issuing new term debt.  Reports from banks’ treasurers suggest that the funding requirement in 2011 is larger than in 2010.  The banks made good progress in early 2011, issuing around £56 billion of term debt in public markets in the first quarter (Chart 1.8), and at least a further £13 billion in April.  In addition to funds raised in public markets, contacts reported that private markets continued to be an important source of funding, with at least £20 billion raised from this source in Q1.  Banks’ funding costs have drifted up since late 2009.  Many lenders report that their marginal funding source is typically long-term wholesale debt since this is the market in which it is possible to raise a large amount of funding over a short period. One proxy for UK banks’ marginal long-term funding cost is the sum of three-month Libor and the average of credit default swap (CDS) premia for the major UK lenders (Chart 1.9).(1) Chart 1.8 Term issuance by the major UK lenders in public markets(a) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 2007 08 09 10 11 Guaranteed senior debt(b) Other ABS RMBS CMBS Subordinated debt Unguaranteed senior debt Medium-term notes Covered bond £ billions 90 100 Sources:  Bank of England, Dealogic and Bank calculations.

But since Autumn 2007, the spread over Bank Rate has generally been much higher.  And the recent upward drift in funding costs has occurred despite improvements in the capital ratios of UK banks.  That upward drift in funding costs will have put upward pressure on rates charged to businesses and households (Section 1.4). 1.4 Credit conditions Some indicators have pointed to a modest easing in credit conditions since the February Report, but conditions remained restrictive for households and some businesses.   Corporate sector finances During and following the recession, businesses undertook a significant amount of financial restructuring.  For example, during 2009, companies collectively paid down bank debt significantly faster than they took out new loans, while gross corporate bond issuance was strong, as some companies switched from bank to non-bank debt.  In addition, companies collectively issued a significant amount of equity, and reduced share buybacks. Even including positive net issuance of bonds and equity, overall net external finance raised by private non-financial corporations (PNFCs) has been persistently weak since early 2009 (Chart 1.10).  In part, that is likely to have reflected weak demand for finance:  companies reduced their capital expenditure very sharply during the recession.  But restrictions to the supply of credit are also likely to have played a role, making bank credit unaffordable or unavailable for some companies.(1) More recently, there has been evidence of some improvement in the supply of bank credit.  Overall, lenders reported that credit availability to the corporate sector had improved a little in 2011 Q1, the ninth consecutive quarter that an improvement was reported.  The spreads charged on loans to medium-sized and large businesses were reported to have fallen in 2011 Q1, although they rose a little on loans to small businesses (Chart 1.11).  Consistent with that pattern, reports from the Bank’s network of Agents have typically distinguished between gradually improving credit conditions for large businesses but conditions remaining tight for small businesses.(2) Investment picked up during 2010 (Section 2) and that would typically be associated with increased demand for credit.  But to date, net external finance raised has remained negative. That could be because some companies have been able to (1) For more details see ‘Understanding the weakness of bank lending’, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Vol. 50, No. 4, pages 311–20.

(a) The estimated marginal funding cost of extending variable-rate sterling-denominated loans. This is calculated as the sum of three-month Libor plus a weighted average of the five-year CDS premia of the major UK lenders (Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide, Northern Rock, Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander UK).  For April 2011 the weights are held fixed at March 2011 values.  Marginal funding costs may vary across lenders.  Lenders with a greater proportion of retail funding may consider the cost of deposits when setting their marginal funding cost.  Section 1 Money and asset prices 15 finance investment from internal funds:  in aggregate, the corporate sector has been running a substantial financial surplus (Section 2). Some companies may also be using that financial surplus to repurchase equity:  share buybacks increased in 2011 Q1, perhaps indicating that some companies had become more confident about their cash flow.  But share buybacks remain below the levels seen in the years immediately preceding the financial crisis.  Household sector finances  Secured lending makes up the vast majority of lending to individuals.  Flows of net secured lending have been weak in recent years (Chart 1.12).  That reflects a sharp fall in gross new lending for house purchase, which in turn is likely to reflect in part tight credit conditions:  for example, first-time buyers have found it difficult to obtain credit.  Increased debt repayments by households could also reduce net lending, but regular repayments of secured debt have been little changed since late 2007.  And other lump-sum repayments — an indicator of early repayments of secured debt — have actually fallen somewhat (Chart 1.12).  Moreover, the major UK lenders reported that they had not observed widespread overpayments of mortgages in 2010. The outlook for the demand for borrowing depends in part on the interest rates charged by banks.  The interest rate that banks charge to new borrowers will be affected by the cost of funding that lending (Section 1.3) and banks’ perception of the credit risk attached to making the loan.  Prior to the financial crisis, spreads over Bank Rate for quoted fixed-rate mortgage products were small and there was little difference between lending rates according to loan to value (LTV) ratios.  But as the crisis unfolded, the quoted rates on mortgage products fell only modestly, despite the large falls in Bank Rate, as banks’ funding costs rose relative to Bank Rate (Chart 1.9).  And most lenders withdrew very high LTV ratio products.  In addition, spreads between different LTV ratio products widened, suggesting that banks came to view the credit risk on those products quite differently. In the early months of 2011, the spread between 90% and 75% LTV ratio products narrowed a little (Chart 1.13).  Given that the funding cost of these products is likely to be similar, that small narrowing might reflect a reassessment by banks of the relative credit risks of different types of borrowers, or possibly an increase in competition for mortgage lending at high LTV ratios.  In addition, respondents to the Credit Conditions Survey suggested that there had been a pickup in the availability of credit to borrowers with LTV ratios over 75% in 2011 Q1, with availability expected to improve further in 2011 Q2.  But the spread between 75% mortgage products and those with higher LTV ratios remains significantly greater than before the crisis.

Indicators of housing market activity, such as housing transactions and mortgage approvals, remained well below their post-2000 average levels at the beginning of 2011 (Table 1.A).  RICS data suggest that new buyer enquiries continued to fall in 2011 Q1, while new instructions to sell picked up a little.  Indicators of house prices were mixed in early 2011 (Table 1.A). 1.5 Money Broad money growth remained well below pre-crisis norms and significantly weaker than nominal GDP growth (Chart 1.14).  Four-quarter growth in broad money, as measured by M4, excluding the holdings of interbank intermediaries, fell to 1.7% in 2011 Q1.  Some of the weakness in money growth relative to the growth of nominal spending could reflect banks continuing to increase their capital and companies becoming less reliant on bank credit.  These factors are likely to persist in the near term, suggesting that a given rate of growth in nominal spending is likely to be associated with weaker growth in broad money than was typically the case before the crisis.(1) Twelve-month growth in households’ broad money weakened to 2.0% in March, significantly below the growth rates seen in the years preceding the financial crisis.  PNFCs’ money holdings picked up somewhat during 2009, but more recently growth has fallen back (Chart 1.15), and in the twelve months to March 2011, money holdings of PNFCs increased by only 1.2%.

The latest observation is 2011 Q1. (c) At current market prices.  The latest observation is 2010 Q4.  In 2010 Q4, GDP fell by 0.5% (Table 2.A) although output was disrupted by the impact of heavy snow (Section 3).  Provisional data from the ONS indicate that output rose by 0.5% in 2011 Q1, but excluding the boost from the unwinding of snow effects, output remained flat.  Over the four quarters to 2010 Q4, consumer spending fell by 0.1% but business spending on investment and stockbuilding together increased by around a third.  With a major fiscal consolidation now under way (Section 2.2), growth will depend heavily upon the path of private sector domestic demand (Section 2.1).  Developments in the world economy will also play a significant role in determining the path of the UK recovery (Section 2.3).  Exports and imports both grew strongly in 2010 (Section 2.4). Nominal demand Nominal GDP growth was 0.5% in 2010 Q4, despite the fall in real activity (Chart 2.1).  The pattern of relatively weak real activity but marked increases in prices is similar to that seen around the end of 2009. Nominal GDP growth is likely to be strong in Q1 reflecting real GDP growth of 0.5% and marked rises in prices following January’s VAT increase (Section 4).  But the evolution of nominal spending over the remainder of 2011 is uncertain.  The path of nominal spending since mid-2009 may provide a positive signal about households’ and businesses’ willingness to spend.  In that case, steady nominal spending growth could continue.  But, if private demand is relatively unresponsive to price changes in the short term, nominal spending outturns might have been a mechanical consequence of tax changes and other factors that have raised inflation.(1) In that case, the quarterly rate of growth of nominal spending could fall back as these price effects wane. After rising over the first three quarters of 2010, GDP was flat on average around the turn of the year. Consumer spending stagnated over 2010 and the near-term outlook for consumption is subdued. Business spending on stockbuilding and investment together rose strongly in the four quarters to 2010 Q4.  Although the contribution of stockbuilding has started to wane, indicators point towards a continued rise in business investment.  Exports grew robustly over 2010 but so did imports and net trade reduced growth over 2010.  The recovery in global demand continued, but the possibility of dislocation in some periphery euro-area countries continues to pose a risk to UK activity. 2 Demand Section 2 Demand 17 Table 2.A Expenditure components of demand(a) Percentage changes on a quarter earlier Averages 2010 1997–2009 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Household consumption(b) 0.6 -0.2 0.5 -0.1 -0.3 Government consumption 0.5 0.5 0.2 -0.5 0.4 Investment 0.6 3.9 0.1 3.6 -1.8 of which, business investment 0.6 7.7 0.2 4.0 0.0 of which, dwellings investment(c) -0.1 1.3 7.4 4.3 -3.7 Final domestic demand 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 -0.4 Change in inventories(d)(e) 0.0 0.2 0.7 0.5 0.2 Alignment adjustment(e) 0.0 0.3 -0.2 0.1 0.3 Domestic demand 0.6 1.0 0.9 0.8 0.0 ‘Economic’ exports(f) 0.8 -1.0 3.0 1.7 1.7 ‘Economic’ imports(f) 1.1 1.9 2.1 1.9 3.1 Net trade(e)(f) -0.1 -0.8 0.2 -0.1 -0.5 of which, goods(e)(f) -0.1 -0.5 0.5 -0.4 -0.4 of which, services(e) 0.0 -0.3 -0.4 0.3 -0.1 Real GDP at market prices 0.5 0.2 1.1 0.7 -0.5 (a) Chained-volume measures.

But the recovery in activity over 2010 was driven by business rather than household spending;  while business investment and stockbuilding together contributed 2.5 percentage points to GDP growth over the four quarters to Q4, consumer spending reduced it by 0.1 percentage points.  Although investment and stockbuilding are typically more cyclical than consumer spending, the experience in 2010 was unusual, particularly for business investment relative to consumer spending. This pattern may, in part, have reflected significantly stronger corporate income growth than household income growth. Households’ real incomes have been eroded by higher import and energy prices.  But some companies’ profits have probably been boosted by export strength over 2010:  export prices have remained high, and export volumes have been increasing. That has been one factor behind the private non-financial corporation sector financial surplus continuing to rise over 2010 even as investment picked up (Chart 2.3).  In contrast, the household financial balance declined over 2010. Survey measures of confidence also indicate greater optimism among companies than households (Chart 2.4).  This is particularly true for the manufacturing sector.  Service sector confidence has followed consumer confidence more closely, at least until recently. Household spending Consumer spending fell by 0.3% in Q4, in part reflecting weakness in consumer services, which is likely to be related to heavy snow in December.  After being broadly flat in the four quarters to 2010 Q4, consumption remained around 4% below its pre-recession level and much further below a continuation of its pre-recession trend (Chart 2.5).  Indicators of consumer spending remained subdued in Q1.  Retail sales volumes grew by only 0.3% and private new car registrations fell. Households have faced a pronounced squeeze on their real incomes in recent years.  Nominal labour income growth has been weak as employment fell (Section 3) and wage growth weakened (Section 4).  Meanwhile, increasing import prices and commodity prices and, from January 2011, higher VAT have added to the squeeze on real incomes.  Overall, real post-tax labour income fell by 1.3% over 2010, taking it back to its 2007 Q4 level (Chart 2.6). As well as adjusting to weak current income, households will also need to adjust to the impact that the recession has had on their future earnings prospects.  The MPC believes that there has been a persistent reduction in underlying productivity (Section 5).  That is likely to result in lower wages than would otherwise have been the case.

Section 2 Demand 19 A key question is the extent to which the necessary adjustment of consumption to a lower expected path of income is so far complete.  The more that consumption has adjusted to weaker real incomes already, then the smaller the adjustment that is still to come, and therefore the sooner some recovery in consumption could begin. It is difficult to judge how much of the adjustment has happened because, as discussed in previous Reports, it is likely that other factors have also been pulling down spending. Households may have postponed spending as uncertainty rose during the recession, or if they were unsure about the impact of the prospective fiscal consolidation on their own incomes. The experience of the financial crisis and recession may have also led households to increase desired levels of saving for precautionary motives or to reduce debt levels, as they became aware that the degree of economic stability previously experienced was unusual.  Acting against that, the low level of both short-term and long-term real interest rates, driven in part by monetary policy, continues to provide support to consumption.  The more that such factors, when taken together, are currently dragging down consumption, then the greater the adjustment of consumption to current and future income weakness that is still to come.  But the outlook for consumption will also depend on how quickly the drag from those other factors dissipates. The GfK measure of consumer confidence fell further in April (Chart 2.4), consistent with continued weak consumption in Q2.  The outlook for consumer spending further ahead is discussed in more detail in Section 5. Companies’ spending Companies’ spending on stockbuilding and investment together rose strongly over the four quarters to 2010 Q4 (Chart 2.2).  In large part, that reflected businesses rebuilding stock levels following sharp cuts over the recession.  But the contribution of inventories to GDP began to fall back over 2010 H2 (Chart 2.7), and its impact may wane further in coming quarters. Business investment rose by 12% over the four quarters to 2010 Q4, although that in part reflected some bringing forward of aircraft purchases ahead of changes to their VAT treatment in January 2011.  Some of the recovery over 2010 probably reflected companies restarting investment projects put on hold during the recession.  The demand outlook will be a key determinant of the extent to which investment continues to recover from its current low level (Chart 2.8). But investment will also depend on companies’ internal and external resources as well as their desire to invest. Uncertainty regarding the global outlook or the impact of the fiscal consolidation could adversely affect investment:  survey evidence from the CBI suggests that, in aggregate, the drag on Chart 2.5 Household consumption(a) 90 95 100 105 110 2005 06 07 08 09 10 Indices:  2008 Q1 = 100 Continuation of pre-recession trend(b) Household consumption (a) Chained-volume measure.

But, to the extent that companies do want to invest, ample internal resources should facilitate some increase.  Companies have faced higher costs, but for exporters this is likely to have been offset by the boost to revenues from the past depreciation of sterling.  And although profits remain lower as a share of GDP than immediately prior to the recession, lower spending on investment, dividends and interest payments as a share of GDP has led to a larger-than-usual financial surplus (Chart 2.3).  It is possible that this reflects companies’ desire to increase their cash holdings for precautionary reasons.  But this could also be used to fund future investment. Companies’ ability to fund investment externally has also improved somewhat over 2010, especially for larger businesses (Section 1), which have experienced the most marked recovery in investment (Chart 2.9). Business investment growth is likely to fall back somewhat in the near term as unusually high spending on aircraft unwinds. But surveys of investment intentions are broadly consistent with further underlying growth in early 2011 (Table 2.B). 2.2 Government spending and fiscal policy The MPC’s forecast is conditioned on the fiscal plans set out in the March Budget and supplemented by the assumed composition of government spending underlying the Office for Budget Responsibility’s (OBR’s) associated Economic and Fiscal Outlook.  The tax and spending plans set out in the March Budget were little changed relative to the plans for fiscal consolidation set out in the June 2010 Budget and the October 2010 Spending Review. The OBR’s central forecast is for a large decline in the public sector deficit, with the majority of the consolidation being achieved through public sector expenditure growing at a more modest pace than nominal GDP (Chart 2.10).  Stripping out interest payments and controlling for the position in the economic cycle, a similar proportion of the consolidation is planned to occur in 2011/12 to that already observed in 2010/11.(1) 2.3 External demand The IMF estimates that world GDP grew by 5% in 2010 — above its 1998–2007 average rate — with a marked expansion in emerging economies and a recovery in several advanced economies including Germany and the United States (Chart 2.11).  Nonetheless, there remain risks to the outlook, Chart 2.8 Business investment(a) 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 1985 90 95 2000 05 10 Recessions(b) Business investment Index:  2008 Q1 = 100 (a) Chained-volume measure.

Section 2 Demand 21 including from continued sovereign debt worries in the euro area (Section 1). On 11 March, north-east Japan was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.  These events led to a substantial destruction of capacity, with power supply disruption also impairing production more widely in Japan.  Household and business confidence fell sharply.  The Bank of Japan has revised its median forecasts for financial-year GDP growth down by 1 percentage point in 2011/12 and up by 0.9 percentage points in 2012/13, with reconstruction spending providing some boost to GDP.  The direct trade impact on the United Kingdom is likely to be small, with Japan accounting for only around 2% of UK exports of goods and services.  But there is potential for some disruption to UK supply chains (see the box on pages 24–25). Emerging economies Emerging economies experienced stronger growth over 2010 than had been expected by the IMF at the start of the year.(1) In recent months several emerging economies have tightened monetary policy.  That may slow growth — for example, Chinese purchasing managers’ indices have recently fallen back.  But IMF projections for emerging economy growth as a whole over 2011 remain robust (Chart 2.11). The euro area Overall euro-area GDP rose by 0.3% in 2010 Q4, driven in part by a strong contribution from net trade.  But the experience of different countries continued to vary markedly (Chart 2.12).  German output grew by 4% in the year to 2010 Q4, despite weather-related disruption to the construction sector in Q4, leaving it only 1.4% below its pre-recession peak.  But output in the euro-area periphery remained weak over 2010. Periphery euro-area countries continue to face substantial challenges in improving their competitiveness and fiscal positions, and supporting their banking systems.  And although the European authorities and the IMF have continued to provide support, yields on periphery economies’ sovereign debt remain elevated (Section 1).  To date there is limited sign of a drag on activity in the rest of the euro area:  for example, aggregate purchasing managers’ indices rose in Q1.  But a further material deterioration in the periphery countries continues to pose a risk to UK activity through financial market and banking sector linkages and its possible effects on broader euro-area confidence. The United States US GDP increased by 2.8% in the four quarters to 2010 Q4, driven by domestic demand.  In 2011 Q1, GDP increased by only 0.4%, however.

But the US housing market remained weak. 2.4 Exports and imports UK exports UK exports increased by 5.4% over the four quarters to 2010 Q4.  That is likely to have reflected, in part, the improvement in demand conditions abroad.  But it may also reflect the impact of sterling’s depreciation and the resulting improvement in UK exporters’ competitiveness.  Estimates of UK export shares continued to suggest that the fall in sterling has supported goods exports relative to the previous declining trend in their share of world trade (Chart 2.14).  In contrast, the service sector’s export share has been falling, in part reflecting weakness in exports of financial services, although it stabilised towards the end of 2010. Survey data were consistent with strong export growth in both goods and services in Q1;  and the ONS reported that goods export volumes rose strongly over the first two months of 2011 (Table 2.C). UK imports By raising the price of imports relative to the price of domestically produced goods and services, the depreciation of sterling should also encourage households and companies to switch expenditure towards the latter.  But, over the year to 2010 Q4, import growth remained strong at 9.4%.  That strength reflects, in large part, the recovery in demand, especially given the high import intensity of inventories.  And part of the strength can also be attributed to higher aircraft imports prior to the change in their VAT treatment from January 2011 (Table 2.C). Monthly ONS data to February indicate that goods import volumes probably fell sharply in Q1 (Table 2.C).  Import growth was weak even accounting for the reversal of erratic aircraft imports.  But it is difficult to know what signal to take from that weakness, which may in part reflect subdued domestic demand. There are few clear signs of expenditure switching in disaggregated import data, although imports of travel services have fallen back as UK residents cut back on tourist spending overseas.  Continued strong imports of other goods and services may reflect a lack of domestic capacity to produce them;  a survey carried out by the Bank’s Agents suggested that importers were often unable to find competitively priced domestic alternatives.(1) Section 5 discusses the outlook for both import and export growth.

Section 3 Output and supply 23 Output rose by 0.5% in 2011 Q1.  Growth is likely to have been boosted by the rebound in activity following the snow in Q4, but was significantly depressed by a sharp decline in construction output.  Weighted together, and excluding the effect of the snow, services and manufacturing output increased at a modest rate (Section 3.1).  During the recession, output fell by more than employment, so that labour productivity declined.  As output has recovered, the number of people employed and the total hours worked by them have also risen (Section 3.3), with the result that hourly productivity growth has been weak.  These developments mean that productivity remains well below the level implied by a continuation of a pre-recession trend, but the extent to which that weakness reflects a persistent fall in companies’ supply capacity is unclear.  Nonetheless, there is probably some spare capacity within businesses (Section 3.2).  And considerable labour market slack remains.  3.1 Output GDP was provisionally estimated by the ONS to have risen by 0.5% in 2011 Q1 (Chart 3.1).  But excluding the boost to growth from the rebound in activity following the heavy snow in Q4, output was broadly flat.  That weakness in GDP was in large part accounted for by a sharp fall in construction output (Chart 3.1).  Official construction output data have been very volatile over recent quarters compared with other indicators of construction activity.  Excluding construction, output in the rest of the economy grew moderately in Q1:  abstracting from the effects of the snow, output in manufacturing and services grew by about 0.5%.  The box on pages 24–25 discusses the impact of recent factors temporarily affecting GDP growth in more detail. As noted in that box, GDP growth during 2011 is likely to continue to be temporarily affected by special factors;  in particular, the additional bank holiday associated with the 3 Output and supply Output was estimated to have risen by 0.5% in Q1.  Excluding the boost to growth from the rebound in activity following the heavy snow in 2010 Q4, however, GDP was broadly flat.  Within that, and abstracting from the effects of snow, manufacturing and services output grew moderately, but there was a sharp fall in construction output.  The extent of spare capacity within businesses is uncertain:  the growth rate of companies’ effective supply capacity appears to have slowed during the recession, but it is likely that some margin of spare capacity remains.  Employment has recovered somewhat but unemployment remains elevated.

Indices of sectoral output are at basic prices.  24 Inflation Report  May 2011 The impact of special factors on the path of GDP growth In recent quarters, GDP has been affected by a number of significant factors whose effects are not expected to persist.   In particular, the impact of heavy snow and sharp changes in activity in some sectors affected GDP growth in 2010 Q4 and 2011 Q1.  And growth during 2011 is likely to continue to be temporarily affected by factors, such as the additional bank holiday for the royal wedding, and supply chain disruptions following the Japanese earthquake and tsunami.  This box discusses the impact of these special factors and concludes with an assessment of developments in underlying activity. The impact of snow GDP fell by 0.5% in 2010 Q4, but, as discussed in the  February Report, output is likely to have been temporarily depressed by the effect of heavy snowfall.  The ONS estimated that weather-related disruption, in the services and construction sectors in particular, reduced Q4 GDP growth by 0.5 percentage points, so that underlying output was broadly flat (Chart A).(1) As the level of GDP subsequently recovered, the quarterly growth rate of GDP will have been boosted by a corresponding amount.  In addition to that, companies may have caught up some output that they were unable to produce in Q4.  That could have further affected GDP in Q1.  It is difficult to assess the size of the catch-up effect, but Bank staff estimate that companies only made up a very small part of the output lost  in Q4. The impact of sharp movements in sectoral output GDP growth in Q1 was also significantly affected by large decreases in construction and energy output:  construction output fell by almost 5% and energy output by around 2%. Although activity in these sectors may continue to decline in coming quarters, it seems unlikely that there will be further falls of the same magnitude.  Given that, it is helpful to consider GDP excluding those sectors when assessing the prospects for underlying activity.  Excluding these sectors, and abstracting from the rebound in activity following the snow, growth was modest in Q1 (Chart A).   The impact of the royal wedding The additional bank holiday in April for the royal wedding could also affect growth rates during 2011.  There is uncertainty about the likely size of the impact, but the extra bank holiday in June 2002 for the Queen’s Golden Jubilee provides an example of the potential effects.  In 2002, the Jubilee holiday reduced output in both manufacturing and services in June (Chart B).  That was in part due to working-day effects:  while the ONS generally adjusts output for the number of working days, it does not take account of one-off bank holidays, so the additional day off reduced measured activity in most of the economy.  In addition, some companies that usually closed their factories for plant maintenance later in the summer brought forward those closures as the number of staff on holiday was likely to increase.  Those effects depressed output in June, but activity was boosted a little in the surrounding months as some output was rescheduled.  Of course, activity in some sectors may have been boosted, for example in hotels and restaurants, but that was outweighed by the effect on other industries. The impact on the path of GDP growth in 2002 appears to have been sizable.  At the time, the ONS estimated that the effect of the Jubilee holiday could have reduced GDP growth  in 2002 Q2 by between 0.2 percentage points and  0.7 percentage points, and boosted growth in Q3 by between 0.4 percentage points and 0.7 percentage points.(2) Furthermore, the Bank estimated that growth in Q4 was Chart A GDP and manufacturing and services output(a) 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 Q3 Q4 Q1 Percentage changes on a quarter earlier 2010 11 GDP Manufacturing and services output,   excluding the impact of snow(b)  GDP excluding the  impact of snow – + (a) Chained-volume measures.  GDP is at market prices.  Indices of manufacturing and services output are at basic prices. (b) Estimate of services output growth excluding the effect of snow is based on the ONS estimate that 0.4 percentage points of the snow impact on overall GDP growth in 2010 Q4 was accounted for by the service sector, and an assumption that this unwound in 2011 Q1. 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 Jan.

As the extra bank holiday was in April, companies may be able to catch up any lost output in the remaining months of Q2.  But the proximity of the royal wedding to Easter might have encouraged even more companies to move their plant closures forward than did so in 2002. Supply chain disruptions Supply chain disruptions, following the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, are also likely to have reduced UK output in Q2.  In particular, some major Japanese car manufacturers have announced cutbacks to their UK production due to shortages of components usually sourced from Japan, such that car output — which accounts for around 1% of GDP — is likely to have fallen quite substantially in April and May.  There could also be an impact on the output of other industries that rely heavily on inputs sourced from Japan. Conclusions GDP growth was affected by the snow and sharp changes in activity in some sectors in 2010 Q4 and 2011 Q1.  Abstracting from these factors, it is likely that growth was quite weak around the turn of the year, on average:  weighted together, and excluding the impact of snow, manufacturing and services output grew only a little in Q4 and by about 0.5% in Q1 (Chart A).  Other factors are likely to affect activity in Q2, and overall, the MPC judges that headline GDP growth is likely to be a little weaker than underlying output growth in that quarter.  That is because the royal wedding and supply chain effects will probably weigh on GDP growth, although these effects may be partially offset by a positive contribution from construction output.  As the effects of the royal wedding and supply chain disruption unwind, GDP growth should be boosted in Q3.  There may also be an additional upward effect on activity if any output lost in Q2 is made up in Q3.  In that case, output growth would also be reduced in Q4.  In addition, the extra bank holiday associated with the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee could cause further GDP volatility around the middle of 2012. (1) More detail on the ONS estimate of the impact of snow on Q4 GDP can be found in ‘Gross domestic product preliminary estimate’, 25 January 2011.

But some business confidence surveys, which are less likely to be distorted by such factors, are consistent with a pickup in underlying growth in the near term (Chart 3.2):  expectations strengthened in services and remained robust in manufacturing. 3.2 Companies’ supply capacity and capacity pressures The level of output relative to potential supply — the margin of spare capacity — is a key determinant of the costs to companies of increasing output, and therefore also of the prices that they set.  Spare capacity can lie in the labour market or within companies.  Spare capacity in the labour market (Section 3.3) tends to bear down on wage growth (Section 4).  And spare capacity within companies means that higher demand can be met without a commensurate increase in staff employed, or the hours they work, so reducing the cost of expanding output. Companies’ potential supply and spare capacity A margin of spare capacity opened up within companies during the recession, but its size is uncertain.  In part that is because the path of output, and therefore productivity, over the past is uncertain, as GDP data are prone to revision and even later Chart 3.2 GDP and survey indicators of business expectations 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 2005 07 09 11 Differences from averages since 2000 (number of standard deviations)  ONS GDP(b) Range of survey indicators(a)  Diamonds indicate     estimates of GDP   excluding snow(b)(c) – + Sources:  BCC, CBI, CBI/PwC, CIPS/Markit, ONS and Bank calculations.

(c) The ONS estimates that snow disruption depressed GDP growth in Q4 by 0.5 percentage points, and it is assumed that growth was boosted by a corresponding amount in Q1.  26 Inflation Report  May 2011 releases are still only imperfect estimates.  But it is also because the evolution of potential supply is unobservable. One method for assessing the margin of spare capacity and the path of potential supply uses evidence on capacity utilisation from business surveys (Chart 3.3).  Another uses the past trend in productivity, which proxies how companies’ supply capacity might have evolved if the recession had had no effect on the growth rate of supply — as shown by the dashed lines in Chart 3.4.  The gap between the dashed lines and solid lines in Chart 3.4 then indicates how spare capacity would have evolved relative to 2008 Q1 if supply capacity had followed those past trends. Both approaches to estimating potential supply suggest that the extent of spare capacity in the manufacturing sector widened during the recession.  But business surveys suggest that manufacturing capacity has subsequently declined sharply, and that capacity pressures in 2010 Q4 were close to those at the start of the recession (Chart 3.3), whereas the pre-recession trend implies that spare capacity is currently much greater than in 2008 Q1 (Chart 3.4).  In the service sector, both methods indicate that capacity pressures are lower than before the recession.  But the surveys suggest that the amount of spare capacity has declined since 2009, whereas the pre-recession trend implies that the extent of spare capacity has continued to increase.  Assessing the amount of spare capacity in the service sector is a  particularly key judgement, as services account for around three quarters of GDP, while manufacturing represents just over a tenth. It is likely that supply capacity grew somewhat more slowly than its pre-recession trend rate during the recession.  As discussed in the February Report, there are a number of channels through which supply growth may have been impaired.  The growth rate of the capital stock will have slowed as investment fell and some businesses were liquidated.  And tighter credit conditions may have restricted some companies’ ability to meet demand.  Moreover, the decline in hours worked may have reduced the opportunity for employees to acquire skills while working.  Those channels suggest that using the pre-recession trend may not give a good estimate of the extent of spare capacity. But there is also mixed evidence on the reliability of the business surveys as an indicator of spare capacity.  Within surveys, businesses’ evaluation of their capacity utilisation appears to be consistent with their responses to other questions — for example, their responses on whether they are investing to expand capacity (Chart 3.5).  And businesses have been increasing their workforce and the hours worked by their staff (Section 3.3), which is consistent with only a limited degree of spare capacity.  But the level of investment undertaken by companies remains low (Section 2), which is consistent with them having a greater margin of spare capacity Chart 3.4 Labour productivity by sector(a) 88 92 96 100 104 108 112 2005 06 07 08 09 10 Indices:  2008 Q1 = 100 Manufacturing  Continuation of  pre-recession trends(b)  Services (a) Output per hour.

And it is unclear exactly how companies judge their potential supply capacity when responding to such surveys. It may be the case, for example, that the surveys do not give an accurate reflection of the amount of capacity available to companies in the longer run, and instead provide information about the supply capacity that companies can use immediately and at little extra cost — their ‘effective’ supply. For example, some companies responded to the fall in demand during the recession by reducing the number of shifts or production lines.  If those decisions are costly to reverse quickly, they will reduce the effective supply capacity available to businesses in the short run.  But those decisions should be reversible in time, assuming demand recovers, providing companies with more supply capacity. The MPC judges there to have been a persistent fall in the level of companies’ supply capacity relative to a continuation of pre-recession trends, but that some spare capacity within companies nonetheless remains (Section 5).  Some of that spare capacity is probably available to be used immediately. And some has probably been temporarily suspended but could return gradually as demand recovers.   That judgement suggests that labour productivity could grow faster than its pre-recession trend rate without generating inflationary pressure, and that some higher demand could be met with little recruiting (Section 5).  So relatively strong productivity growth might be expected during the recovery. Indeed, since the trough in output in 2009 Q3, hourly productivity in manufacturing has grown at a rate that is a little more rapid than its pre-recession trend, although that recovery faltered slightly in 2010 H2 (Chart 3.4).  In contrast, however, hourly productivity in services appears to have been broadly flat over the past four years (Chart 3.4). 3.3 The labour market Labour demand As well as the scope to vary hourly productivity (Section 3.2), the near-term outlook for companies’ demand for additional employees also depends on:  labour costs (Section 4);  demand (Section 2);  and the extent to which changes in demand can be met by varying average hours worked.  This subsection therefore considers recent developments in employment in heads and hours. LFS employment rose by 143,000 in the three months to February, compared with the three months to November,  after falling by 69,000 over the previous three-month period. LFS employment growth has been volatile recently. Smoothing through that volatility suggests that employment has been rising since the middle of 2010 (Chart 3.6), at around its pre-recession average rate.  That picture is broadly Table 3.A Surveys of employment intentions(a) Averages 2010 2011 since 2000 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 BCC(b) 14 6 11 2 4 10 CBI(b) 1 -15 2 2 -3 6 Agents’ scores(c) 0.3 0.0 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.7 Manpower(b) 10 1 1 1 2 2 Sources:  Bank of England, BCC, CBI, CBI/PwC, Manpower and ONS.

(a) Rolling three-month measures. (1) This is likely to be due to rising real wages, which may encourage people to reduce their working hours, and increased female participation in the labour market, as more women work part-time and so fewer hours on average.  See Barwell, R, Bell, V, Bunn, P and Gutiérrez-Domènech, M (2007), ‘Potential employment in the UK economy’,  Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Vol. 47, No. 1, pages 60–69. consistent with surveys of employment intentions (Table 3.A) and with Workforce Jobs data. The strength of labour demand may be understated by the size of the recent increase in employment alone.  The average hours worked by those in employment have also risen, so that total hours have picked up sharply from their trough in  mid-2009 (Chart 3.6).  Although average hours remain below their pre-recession level, the likelihood of further increases is unclear, given their downward trend over recent decades (Chart 3.7).(1) Movements in average hours may reflect changes in the hours worked by full and part-time employees, or else a shift in the share of these jobs in employment.  The majority of the recent pickup in average hours occurred as the average hours of both full and part-time employees returned to their pre-recession levels, so there may be little scope for those to increase further.  But there was a marked shift in the composition towards part-time employment during the recession  (Chart 3.8).  There may be some scope for that to reverse, which would increase overall average hours worked.  In particular, during the recession there was a rise in the number of part-time employees who reported that they were working part-time but would prefer a full-time job (Table 3.B). Companies should therefore be able to increase the hours of these employees relatively easily.   Prospects for employment will also depend on the impact of the fiscal consolidation.  General government employment began to fall in 2010, decreasing by 111,000 over the year. According to Office for Budget Responsibility projections, general government employment is expected to fall by around 400,000 — or about 1.5% of total employment — over the next five years.  But the private sector will remain the key driver of overall employment. Labour supply and labour market tightness The impact of changes in labour demand on inflation will depend on the size of the labour force.  That depends on both the population, and the proportion of people who participate in the labour market. ONS estimates suggest that net immigration moved back to above its pre-recession level during the first half of 2010, thus boosting the population and supply of labour (Chart 3.9). That rise in net immigration was driven in part by fewer  British citizens emigrating.  There was also an increase in the number of people migrating to the United Kingdom from outside the European Union.

The participation rate tends to fall in recessions as the unemployment rate picks up and reduced prospects of finding work discourage some people from searching for it.  The participation rate has fallen a little since the start of the recession, but by less than in the 1990s.  And the fall in participation during the recent recession has been entirely accounted for by an increase in the number of students  (Chart 3.10).  This fall may be less persistent than the falls associated with past recessions, where the rise in inactivity was also associated with long-term sickness and a fall in participation by older workers. The amount of downward pressure that elevated unemployment puts on wages is also affected by the degree to which the unemployed become detached from the labour market.  For example, people who suffer an extended period of unemployment may lose, or be unable to acquire, the skills sought by employers.  Long-term unemployment has continued to increase, although it remains lower than in the 1980s and 1990s (Chart 3.11). The degree of downward inflationary pressure resulting from high unemployment could also be reduced if structural changes in the economy lead to a mismatch between the demand for, and supply of, labour.  This mismatch could arise across skills, regions or sectors.  For example, difficulties in relocating could lead to a sustained period in which some regions have high vacancies, but others face high unemployment.  There has been little evidence of increased mismatch in the UK labour market so far, but such effects may take time to emerge. Given developments in labour supply and demand, it is likely that considerable slack remains in the labour market.  The unemployment rate is just below 8%.  Other indicators are also consistent with some degree of labour market slack  (Table 3.C).  That slack is likely to have put downward pressure on wage growth (Section 4).  The extent to which elevated unemployment continues to put downward pressure on wages is a key judgement underlying the outlook for inflation (Section 5).

Averages since 1998 Q4.  30 Inflation Report  May 2011 4 Costs and prices CPI inflation rose further above the 2% target in 2011 Q1.  The elevated rate of inflation reflects a number of factors, whose influence is likely to be temporary (Chart 4.1).  These include the increase in the standard rate of VAT to 20%, increases in energy prices and the pass-through of higher import prices (Section 4.1).  There is a good chance that CPI inflation will reach 5% later this year, largely reflecting further recent increases in energy and import prices.  But there remains significant uncertainty about the path of those prices:   Table 4.A illustrates the sensitivity of CPI inflation to retail energy prices, while the box on pages 34–35 discusses global inflationary pressure.    As the impetus from external price pressures dissipates and the increase in VAT drops out of the annual comparison, inflation will depend on the balance between a number of substantial, but countervailing, forces.  On the one hand, second-round effects of the sustained period of above-target inflation could place some upward pressure on prices and wages (Section 4.2), while companies may also seek to restore their profit margins (Section 4.3).  On the other hand, spare capacity within companies and in the labour market (Section 3) should continue to bear down on costs and prices.  4.1 Consumer prices CPI inflation was 4.0% in March, lower than in February but significantly higher than the 2010 Q4 average of 3.4%.   RPI inflation was 5.3% in March.  With January’s CPI outturn lying more than 1 percentage point away from the target, the Governor, on behalf of the Committee, wrote an open letter to the Chancellor.(1) As discussed in the February Report, the elevated rate of inflation over the past year or so can be accounted for by movements in VAT, energy and import prices (Chart 4.1).

The range of estimates of the impact of VAT on CPI inflation  is based on the stylised illustrations shown in Chart 4.2.  The VAT range is adjusted to allow for changes in VAT on petrol prices already being incorporated in the energy price impacts. The range of estimates of the impact of energy prices on CPI inflation is based on the direct contribution from electricity, gas and other fuels and fuels and lubricants and an estimate of the total impact including indirect effects, calculated as the average of the direct energy effects in the current and previous two quarters.  The range of estimates of the impact of import prices on CPI inflation is based on differences between CPI goods inflation excluding energy and CPI services inflation excluding airfares.  Further details can be found in the footnote to Chart B on page 34 of the February 2011 Inflation Report.  The total range is calculated by adding together the top and bottom of the individual ranges for the impacts of VAT, energy prices and import prices.  The green swathe shows CPI inflation less the minimum and maximum of the blue swathe.   (1) The letter is available at www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/pdf/ cpiletter110215.pdf. CPI inflation rose further above the 2% target in 2011 Q1.  Increases in VAT, energy and import prices can account for the current elevated rate of inflation and also for the increase in inflation  in Q1.  Excluding the effects of those factors, the prices of other goods and services appear to have increased at a rate below the inflation target, as spare capacity has put downward pressure on costs and prices.  Evidence from movements in indicators of inflation expectations remained mixed. Regular pay growth remained around 2%.

Section 4 Costs and prices 31 Although the effects cannot be identified precisely, Bank analysis suggests that together these factors could have contributed between 3 and 5 percentage points to  CPI inflation in 2011 Q1.(1) And, over the whole period since 2006 Q4, they have probably contributed between 8% and 13% to the price level. Excluding the estimates of the contribution of VAT, energy and import prices, prices of other goods and services appear, on average, to have increased at a rate below the inflation target since mid-2009 (Chart 4.1).  That does not indicate what inflation would have been in the absence of those factors, as many aspects of the economy would have been different had VAT, energy and import prices not risen.  But it does suggest that other forces have reduced domestically generated inflation (Section 4.3).    The rest of this subsection discusses the past impact of VAT, energy and import prices, and their role in explaining why inflation may rise further in the near term. VAT The contribution of VAT to annual CPI inflation is likely to  have increased in 2011 Q1, as pass-through to consumer prices of the increase in the standard rate to 20% at the beginning of this year appears to have been higher than for the restoration of the rate to 17.5% in January 2010.  As discussed in previous Reports, evidence from the ONS appears broadly consistent with around half of the temporary cut to 15% in  December 2008, and the subsequent reversal in 2010, having been passed through into consumer prices.  The ONS estimates that the 2011 VAT rise increased the twelve-month inflation rate by around 0.8 percentage points between December 2010 and January 2011.(2) And Bank staff estimate that further pass-through is likely to have occurred subsequently, so that around three quarters of the increase was passed on to consumer prices by the end of Q1.  Chart 4.2 shows a stylised illustration of the contribution of VAT to CPI inflation using different assumptions about the extent of pass-through.  For example, varying the extent of pass-through for the 2011 increase between 50% and 100% suggests that the contribution to inflation is likely to have been between 0.7 and 1.4 percentage points in 2011 Q1.  That can be compared with the 0.4 to 1.1 contribution obtained by varying the extent of pass-through for the 2010 increase between 25% and 75%.  If the pass-through of the latest increase is now complete, then the effect on inflation should remain broadly the same until it drops out of the  twelve-month comparison in early 2012.

For example, oil prices rose sharply in 2007 and the first half of 2008, fell back rapidly during the worst of the financial crisis, but then rose steadily throughout 2009 and 2010 (Chart 4.3).  Between the February and May Reports, the price of Brent crude, in sterling terms, rose by a further 22%. Those recent price increases appear to have been triggered by concerns about oil supply following political developments in the Middle East and North Africa.  In particular, Libya accounts for about 2% of world oil production, and output there fell significantly following recent unrest.  The rise in oil prices could also reflect the risk that unrest will spread to other large oil producers in the region.  Futures prices in the fifteen working days to 4 May suggested that oil prices were expected to fall gradually during the rest of 2011 (Chart 4.3).  But the degree of uncertainty attached to the outlook for oil prices by financial market participants increased a little between the February and May Reports (Section 1).  Higher oil prices affect CPI inflation directly through the price of fuels, and indirectly through their impact on the production and transportation costs of other goods and services.  Petrol prices contributed 0.6 percentage points to CPI inflation in 2011 Q1, a slightly higher contribution than in 2010 Q4, reflecting the rapid pass-through of higher oil prices and the effect of higher VAT on petrol.  And inflation in Q1 is likely to have been raised by the indirect effects of the oil price increases since mid-2010.  CPI inflation in 2011 Q1 was also boosted by recent increases in retail gas and electricity prices.  Further, wholesale gas price futures rose by just under 20% in the period between the February and May Reports (Chart 4.4).  Some of that increase occurred following the Japanese earthquake and tsunami in March, reflecting concerns that supplies of liquefied natural  gas could be diverted away from the United Kingdom to Japan for a sustained period.  And it may also have reflected the announcement by the German Government of a moratorium on the development of nuclear power stations. The MPC’s latest central projection assumes a 15% rise in domestic gas prices and a 10% rise in electricity prices during 2011 H2 and 2012 Q1, materially larger than the 5% increase in gas prices underlying the projections in the February Report. But there is considerable uncertainty about the scale and pace of the pass-through of changes in wholesale energy prices to utility prices. Overall, the contribution of energy prices, both direct and indirect, to CPI inflation was probably between ¾ and  1¼ percentage points in 2011 Q1.  That contribution could  rise significantly over the rest of the year, reflecting the assumption on utility prices — which would add around  ½ percentage point to CPI inflation — and further indirect Chart 4.3 Sterling oil prices(a) 0 20 40 60 80 100 2007 08 09 10 11 12 £ per barrel Futures prices at the time    of the May 2011 Report Spot price(b)  Futures prices at the time   of the February 2011 Report Sources:  Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters Datastream and Bank calculations.

Section 4 Costs and prices 33 effects from energy price increases.  The direct contribution from petrol prices is likely to stay broadly unchanged over that period, assuming that oil prices follow futures prices.   But, given the volatility of energy prices, any such assumptions are very likely to be proven wrong.  And plausible alternative paths for retail energy prices would have a significant impact on CPI inflation.  Between the February and May Reports, sterling oil prices rose by 22%, broadly consistent with an eventual increase in petrol prices of just under 10%.  And the MPC’s assumption on domestic gas and electricity prices was revised up by 10 percentage points.  Table 4.A on page 30 illustrates that, relative to the paths underlying the MPC’s latest projections for inflation, the combined impact of  petrol prices increasing by a further 10% and gas and electricity bills rising by a further 10% would mechanically add  0.9 percentage points to CPI inflation.  Or, alternatively, the impact of petrol prices falling by 10% and utility prices being 10% weaker than expected would reduce inflation to a similar degree.  That highlights the scope for energy prices to be a major determinant of near-term movements in CPI inflation.  Non-energy commodity and import prices Global inflationary pressures have strengthened over the past year.  As discussed in the box on pages 34–35, in large part that recent strength is likely to have reflected increases in commodity prices, including non-energy commodities such as metals and agricultural products (Chart 4.5).  Although energy prices rose further after the February Report, metals and agricultural prices were broadly unchanged.  Futures curves for non-energy commodities are broadly flat or slightly downward sloping. UK import prices depend on the evolution of both world prices and the exchange rate.  Import prices rose rapidly following the depreciation of sterling between the middle of 2007 and the end of 2008 (Chart 4.6).  The recent further pickup in import prices has been driven by movements in global prices.  The extent and timing of the pass-through of increases in import prices to UK CPI inflation is uncertain.  But, as explained in the February Report, one way of assessing that pass-through is by considering relative movements in consumer goods and services prices.  Estimates based on that approach — and the assumption that goods prices are between two and three times more import-intensive than services — suggest that non-energy import prices could have contributed between 1½ and 2½ percentage points to CPI inflation in  2011 Q1.  And, since the depreciation of sterling that began in 2007, import prices may have contributed 4¼% to 6½% to the level of consumer prices.    Looking ahead, the already sizable contribution of import prices to CPI inflation in 2011 Q1 is likely to increase over the rest of the year, as past increases in commodity prices feed Chart 4.6 UK import prices and foreign export prices 10 5 0 5 10 15 Percentage changes on a year earlier 2005 06 07 08 09 10 Foreign export prices(b)  UK import prices excluding fuels(a)  + – Sources:  ONS, Thomson Reuters Datastream and Bank calculations.

A significant part of that strength reflected the depreciation of sterling, but, more recently, increases in world export prices have also added upward pressure.  And domestic inflation in some other countries, especially emerging economies, has been relatively high and increasing.  A key issue is whether global inflationary pressures will remain elevated. That will depend, in part, on why global prices have been rising.   World export price pressures Much of the recent strength in world export price inflation  has reflected substantial rises in commodity prices (Chart A). In part, that reflected supply factors in some commodity markets, as discussed in a box in the February Report.(1) Adverse weather conditions have raised some agricultural commodity prices.  And since the February Report, developments in the Middle East and North Africa have led to disruptions in oil supply, which have boosted oil prices.  If some of those supply pressures recede, prices in affected markets could well fall back, putting downward pressure on inflation.   Robust global demand for commodities has also played an important role, however.  Global demand was stronger than expected in 2010.  For example, growth in developing Asia,  a region where commodity demand has been increasing rapidly, turned out more than 3 percentage points higher in 2010 than the IMF had expected in Spring 2009.  Such upside surprises are likely to have boosted commodity prices.   In order to gauge the outlook for global prices, it is useful to consider not only whether global growth could continue to boost commodity prices, but also whether demand is boosting global inflationary pressure more generally.  It is possible that the unexpectedly strong recovery in global demand over 2010 simply reflected an earlier-than-expected recovery, particularly in those economies that had not been directly affected by the financial crisis.  In that case, high CPI inflation in some emerging economies may primarily reflect rising commodity prices;  if growth settles at close to trend, then upward pressure on both commodity and consumer price inflation could abate.  Most commodities futures prices are currently downward sloping or broadly flat, although those prices did not anticipate the rise in commodity prices over the past  three years.    But high CPI inflation in some emerging economies may signal that growth is proceeding at unsustainable rates and leading to pressures on productive capacity.  In the April 2011 World Economic Outlook, the IMF reported that output in a number of emerging economies was above pre-crisis trends.  And even if current high CPI inflation in some emerging economies does largely reflect rises in the price of commodities such as food and energy, inflationary pressures could persist if those rises feed through to higher labour costs.  Faster growth in unit labour costs, which measure labour costs per unit of output produced, could therefore signal more persistent inflationary pressures.  In some emerging economies, for example Brazil and China, unit labour cost growth appears to be at above-average rates, having increased quite sharply in recent quarters (Chart B).

But overall global inflationary pressure depends on pressures in advanced economies too:  unit labour costs have recently been growing at or below average rates in the United States and the  euro area (Chart B). Conclusions and implications for the United Kingdom The outlook for commodity prices is always uncertain.  In particular, further demand or supply shocks could lead  to sharp movements in prices.  And changes in the commodity-intensiveness of growth may also lead to substantial price movements.   But there is particular uncertainty at present around the role of global activity in global inflationary pressures.  The recent strength in commodity and world export price inflation could abate if it reflects a combination of supply-side factors in commodity markets and an earlier-than-expected recovery in world growth.  But if overheating in emerging economies has also pushed up prices, then global inflationary pressures could prove more persistent, without appropriate countervailing action by policymakers.   In some circumstances, a persistent increase in domestic inflation in overseas economies relative to that in the  United Kingdom could be offset by a corresponding move in bilateral exchange rates which could limit the consequences for UK import prices.   To date, indicators point to relatively modest inflationary pressures in the United States and the euro area, which together account for more than half of UK imports.  But inflationary pressures in some emerging economies appear  to have increased recently and, depending on exchange rate movements, that could put further upward pressure on  UK inflation.  (1) See the box on page 33 of the February 2011 Report. through into global prices and then into UK consumer prices. Evidence from indicators at the early stage of the supply chain lends some support to that view.  For example, input and output prices in the manufacturing sector, excluding the direct effects of higher energy prices, picked up further in 2011 Q1.  4.2 Inflation expectations Developments in inflation expectations Evidence from movements in indicators of longer-term inflation expectations remains mixed (Chart 4.7).  Measures of longer-term household expectations have picked up over the past year, to levels at or above their series averages.  But only a short backrun of data is available for most of these series, so it is not clear how much should be read into such comparisons. Longer-term expectations of professional forecasters have remained broadly stable over the past year, while the expectations of financial market participants have fallen slightly over the same period.  Overall, these indicators of inflation expectations do not provide any strong evidence that longer-term inflation expectations have risen materially.  Even without material increases in longer-term expectations, however, there could be greater upward pressure on wages and prices if households and companies expect inflation to return to target, but only slowly, perhaps because they think that the MPC is currently more tolerant of deviations of inflation from the target.  That might be reflected in higher shorter-term inflation expectations, although it is hard to disentangle those effects from the impact of the increases in VAT, energy and import prices discussed in Section 4.1, which are also likely to raise shorter-term expectations.  One way of attempting to distinguish between these factors is to compare changes in inflation expectations with the Chart 4.7 Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations 1 2 3 4 5 2006 07 08 09 10 11 Barclays Basix ﬁve years ahead(a) Bank/NOP ﬁve years ahead(a) YouGov/Citigroup ﬁve to ten years ahead(a) Five-year, ﬁve-year forward RPI inﬂation implied from swaps HM Treasury survey of forecasters:  CPI inﬂation four years ahead(b) Bank survey of forecasters:  CPI inﬂation three years ahead Per cent 0 Sources:  Bank of England, Barclays Capital, Bloomberg, Citigroup, GfK NOP, HM Treasury, YouGov and Bank calculations.

(a) Respondents to the February 2011 Bank of England/GfK NOP Inflation Attitudes Survey were asked which, if any, of these actions they are taking, or planning to take, in light of their expectations of price changes over the next twelve months.  Respondents could select up to three options.   revisions to the MPC’s own view of the most likely path for inflation.  The evidence here is mixed.  For one year ahead measures of expectations, the increases seen over the year to 2011 Q1 are actually smaller than the increase in the MPC’s modal CPI projection over the same period (Chart 4.8).  But at the two-year horizon, measures of household expectations have increased by more than the comparable revision to the MPC’s projection, although professional forecasters’ expectations have risen by somewhat less. The transmission of inflation expectations An increase in household inflation expectations could encourage employees to ask for higher pay from their employer.  In response to a special question in the latest Bank/NOP Inflation Attitudes Survey only around 10% of households said that they would respond to higher near-term inflation expectations by requesting higher wages (Chart 4.9). But, as some employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, that may understate the proportion of households for which an increase in inflation expectations may lead to higher pay demands. An increase in companies’ inflation expectations could lead them to raise their prices by more, or more frequently, than they would otherwise have done.  And it could encourage employers to grant higher wages at the same time as raising prices in order to retain or motivate their staff.  Information on how companies’ inflation expectations affect price and  wage-setting behaviour is scarce.  But evidence from the CBI suggests that over the next twelve months, businesses plan to raise their own prices and wage costs by more than they did over the past twelve months.  4.3 Labour costs and companies’ pricing decisions Labour costs Private sector pay settlements picked up in 2011 Q1:  the mean settlement recorded over the three months to March was 2.3% (Chart 4.10).  That increase was driven by multi-year settlements, in part reflecting the fact that multi-year deals that were agreed prior to this year are more likely than other settlements to have an explicit link to a measure of inflation such as the RPI.  Settlements that have been agreed only for the next year have, in general, been somewhat lower.  But data on multi-year settlements tend to be reported earlier.  So, as the proportion of single-year deals rises over time, the extent of the pickup in aggregate pay settlements is likely to be revised down.  Although the twelve-month mean settlement has risen a little recently, average weekly earnings (AWE) growth excluding bonuses has remained around 2%, some way below its  pre-recession average rate (Table 4.B).

Section 4 Costs and prices 37 which a rise in drift had accounted for much of the pickup in regular pay growth from the very low levels seen in early 2010.   Regular pay drift captures changes in earnings related to working patterns — such as overtime payments — as well as the impact of merit pay increases, which could be associated with productivity improvements.  Increases in these components of pay raise AWE growth.  But they may put little or no upward pressure on labour costs per unit of output, which reflect developments in both earnings and labour productivity, and is a more relevant measure of costs for companies’ pricing decisions.  Unit labour costs grew rapidly during 2009 — reflecting the sharp fall in productivity (Chart 4.11).  Unit  labour cost growth was weaker in 2010, although the most recent weakness in productivity growth, following subdued output growth but continued growth in employment  (Section 3), may put some renewed upward pressure on unit labour costs.  Spare capacity in the labour market (Section 3) is likely to have put downward pressure on wage and unit labour cost growth, as high unemployment reduced the cost to businesses of recruiting and retaining employees. The extent to which wages are likely to be raised by high  near-term inflation — if households and businesses come to expect inflation to persist, or if it leads to resistance to the erosion of households’ real incomes (Section 2) — but are likely to be depressed by the substantial degree of slack in the labour market cannot be judged precisely.  And the path of productivity will also determine the extent to which any further pickup in wage growth is consistent with meeting the inflation target in the medium term.  Section 5 discusses the outlook for wages and productivity. Companies’ pricing decisions  Weakness in output since the onset of the recession and the related margin of spare capacity (Section 3) is likely to have put downward pressure on prices as well as wages.  And that is likely to be a key reason why domestically generated inflation appears to have been running at a rate below the inflation target since mid-2009 (Chart 4.1).   Weakness in domestically generated inflation had, until recently, also been accompanied by strong growth in unit labour costs (Chart 4.11).  Consistent with that, average profit margins — measured by the share of private non-financial companies’ profits in total income — fell sharply during the recession  (Chart 4.12).  Those companies selling predominantly to the domestic market will have experienced an even greater margin squeeze, given that margins for some exporters widened after the sharp rise in sterling export prices that followed the depreciation of sterling.  Chart 4.12 suggests that average margins have now started to recover, consistent with some upward pressure on domestic prices, and hence CPI inflation.

Inflation continues to be sensitive to movements in commodity and energy prices, which have been extremely volatile in the recent past, and could well move sharply again during the forecast period.  But the medium-term outlook for inflation will also reflect substantial, but opposing, domestic pressures on inflation.  To the upside, second-round effects of the sustained period of above-target inflation could put upward pressure on prices.  To the downside, a continuation of recent weak growth and the presence of a substantial margin of spare capacity could push inflation well below the target. The MPC will continue to set policy to balance the upside and downside risks in order to meet the inflation target in the medium term. Chart 5.1 shows the outlook for CPI inflation, on the assumption that Bank Rate follows a path implied by market interest rates.  Along with all the other charts displaying the MPC’s projections appearing in this section, Chart 5.1 assumes that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remains at £200 billion throughout the forecast period. There is a good chance that inflation will reach 5% later this year, and it is more likely than not to remain above the target throughout 2012, boosted by the increase in the standard rate of VAT, higher energy and import prices, and some restoration of companies’ profit margins.  The projection is markedly higher over the first half of the forecast period than in February (Chart 5.4 shows the February projection;  Charts 5.2 and 5.3 CPI inflation is likely to rise further this year, following additional increases in energy and import prices.  It is then expected to fall back during 2012, as the effects of high energy and import price inflation and the recent rise in VAT diminish, and downward pressure from spare capacity persists. But the precise timing and extent of that fall are uncertain.  Underlying growth has moderated in recent quarters, but it is unclear whether that slowdown is temporary or will be prolonged.  The continued global recovery, the considerable stimulus from monetary policy and the past depreciation of sterling should all help to support growth.  But the continuing squeeze on households’ real incomes is likely to weigh on demand, especially over the next year or so.  Under the assumptions that Bank Rate moves in line with market interest rates and the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remains at £200 billion, the chances of inflation being above or below the target in the medium term are judged to be about the same.   2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 2007 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 Percentage increase in prices on a year earlier + – Chart 5.1  CPI inflation projection based on market  interest rate expectations and £200 billion asset  purchases Charts 5.1 and 5.4 depict the probability of various outcomes for CPI inflation in the future.  They have been conditioned on the assumption that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remains at £200 billion throughout the forecast period.  If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that inflation in any particular quarter would lie within the darkest central band on only 10 of those occasions.  The fan charts are constructed so that outturns of inflation are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter red areas on 10 occasions.  In any particular quarter of the forecast period, inflation is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fans on 90 out of 100 occasions. And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions inflation can fall anywhere outside the red area of the fan chart.  Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey background.  In any quarter of the forecast period, the probability mass in each pair of identically coloured bands sums to 10%.  The distribution of that 10% between the bands below and above the central projection varies according to the skew at each quarter, with the distribution given by the ratio of the width of the bands below the central projection to the bands above it.  In Chart 5.1 the probabilities in the lower bands are slightly smaller than those in the upper bands at Years 1, 2 and 3, albeit that the upward skew in Year 1 is smaller than those at Years 2 and 3.  The upward skews in Chart 5.1 are somewhat smaller than those in Chart 5.4, where the ratios are approximately 4:6 at Years 2 and 3;  the upward skew at Year 1 is smaller.  See the box on pages 48–49 of the May 2002 Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.  The dashed lines are drawn at the respective two-year points.  Section 5 Prospects for inflation 39 show the spread of outcomes for CPI inflation one and two years ahead in the May and February Reports).  That largely reflects further rises in energy prices and, associated with them, a higher likelihood of substantial increases in domestic utility prices over the next year.  As the impetus from external price pressures dissipates and the increase in VAT drops out of the annual comparison, inflation should fall back.  But the precise timing and extent of that decline in inflation are uncertain, and will be sensitive to the extent of any further pass-through from the past depreciation of sterling, and to the evolution of energy and commodity prices:  for example, plausible alternative paths for domestic utility prices would have significant implications for the inflation outlook  (Section 4).   Inflation will also depend on the balance between two other substantial, but countervailing, forces.  To the downside, persistent spare capacity is likely to weigh on wages and prices for much of the forecast period.  The extent of that downward pressure will depend on the strength of demand, but also on the evolution of productivity and the performance of the labour market, and therefore the path of potential supply.  But to the upside, the protracted period of above-target inflation may lead to further upward pressure on prices, if households and businesses come to expect elevated inflation to persist, or if the recent and prospective squeeze on households’ real incomes leads to higher pay growth.   The range of views among Committee members over the outlook for inflation is wider than usual.  In the current uncertain environment, modest differences in judgements regarding the factors described above can have a material impact on the outlook.

The coloured bands in Charts 5.2 and 5.3 have a similar interpretation to those on the fan charts.  Like the fan charts, they portray the central 90% of the probability distribution.  If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that inflation in 2012 Q2 and 2013 Q2 would lie somewhere within the range covered by the histogram on 90 occasions.  Inflation would lie outside the range covered by the histogram on 10 out of 100 occasions.  The grey outlines in Charts 5.2 and 5.3 represent the corresponding cross-sections of the February 2011 Inflation Report fan chart, which was conditioned on the same assumption about the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves.  (b) Average probability within each band;  the figures on the y-axis indicate the probability of inflation being within ±0.05 percentage points of any given inflation rate, specified to one decimal place.

Although the most likely outcome for inflation is a little higher than in the February Report in the second half of the forecast period, the upside skew around the mostly likely path is judged to be smaller than in February, so that the average outcome, taking into account the balance of risks, is little changed.  The inflation projection implies that there is a roughly three-in-four chance that inflation will be at least half a percentage point away from the target in the medium term, but with roughly equal probabilities to the upside and downside (Chart 5.6). Chart 5.7 shows the outlook for real GDP growth, also on the assumption that Bank Rate follows a path implied by market interest rates.  Abstracting from the volatility associated with heavy snow last December, output appears to have been broadly flat over the past two quarters.  The reasons for that moderation in growth, and therefore its likely persistence, are uncertain.  But some of the weakness stemmed from a large fall in construction output, which is unlikely to be repeated in subsequent quarters, and business surveys remain consistent with some near-term expansion in activity.  And those surveys and the growth in employment over recent months suggest that underlying activity may have been stronger than indicated by official output data.  The Committee’s central judgement is that some pickup in underlying growth is likely during 2011 — albeit less than judged probable in February — driven by a continuing recovery in business investment and a positive contribution from net exports.

It has been conditioned on the assumption that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remains at £200 billion throughout the forecast period.  To the left of the first vertical dashed line, the distribution reflects the likelihood of revisions to the data over the past;  to the right, it reflects uncertainty over the evolution of GDP growth in the future.  If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that the mature estimate of GDP growth would lie within the darkest central band on only 10 of those occasions.  The fan chart is constructed so that outturns are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter green areas on 10 occasions.  In any particular quarter of the forecast period, GDP is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fan on 90 out of 100 occasions.  And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions GDP growth can fall anywhere outside the green area of the fan chart.  Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey background.  In any quarter of the forecast period, the probability mass in each pair of identically coloured bands sums to 10%.

They indicate the assessed probability of inflation being above target in each quarter of the forecast period.  The width of the swathe at each point in time corresponds to the width of the band of the fan chart in which the target falls in that quarter, or, if the target falls outside the coloured area of the fan chart, the width of the band closest to the target.  The bands in the fan chart illustrate the MPC’s best collective judgement that inflation will fall within a given range.  The swathes in Chart 5.5 show the probability within the entire band of the corresponding fan chart of inflation being close to target;  the swathes should not therefore be interpreted as a confidence interval.  The dashed line is drawn at the two-year point of the May projection.  The two-year point of the February projection was one quarter earlier. Chart 5.5 An indicator of the probability inflation will be above the target  Section 5 Prospects for inflation 41 quarterly GDP growth over the coming quarters (Section 3 box). There remain substantial uncertainties, and a wider than usual range of views among Committee members, regarding the outlook for growth.  Households may have much further to adjust to the significant squeeze in their real incomes.  In that case growth could remain sluggish.  There is also uncertainty over the extent to which net exports will support growth, and the pace at which that support will materialise.  But the corporate sector continues to run a substantial financial surplus:  that suggests there is scope for higher investment spending, or possibly greater support to consumption, if more of the surplus were to be distributed to households.  Overall, the Committee’s best collective judgement is that by the second half of the forecast period, the chances of four-quarter growth being either above or below its historical average rate are broadly equal (Chart 5.8).  The most likely outcome for growth in the medium term is somewhat weaker than in the February Report, reflecting a more gradual recovery in consumption and a less pronounced boost from net exports. But the downside skew around that most likely outcome is judged to be smaller than in February, so that from the  two-year point of the forecast onwards, the average outcome, taking into account the balance of risks, is broadly unchanged. Charts 5.9 and 5.10 show the spread of outcomes for  GDP growth one and two years ahead.  The downside skew around the projection for growth, associated with an even weaker recovery in consumption or a slower boost from net trade, also points to downside risks to the outlook for inflation.  But they are more than offset by other risks, discussed above, that would imply higher inflation for a given level of output, such as the possibility of further 0 20 40 60 80 100 Probability, per cent 2013 Q2 2014 Q2 <1.5 1.5–2.5 2.5–3.5 >3.5 GDP growth (percentage increase in output on a year earlier) (a) These figures are derived from the same distribution as Chart 5.7.

They have been conditioned on the assumption that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remains at £200 billion throughout the forecast period.  The coloured bands in Charts 5.9 and 5.10 have a similar interpretation to those on the fan charts.  Like the fan charts, they portray the central 90% of the probability distribution.  If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that GDP growth in 2012 Q2 and 2013 Q2 would lie somewhere within the range covered by the histogram on 90 occasions.  GDP growth would lie outside the range covered by the histogram on 10 out of 100 occasions.  The grey outlines in Charts 5.9 and 5.10 represent the corresponding cross-sections of the February 2011 Inflation Report fan chart, which was conditioned on the same assumption about the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves.

That is why the risks around the most likely outcome for inflation are weighted a little to the upside, despite the downside risks to growth. The projection for growth implies a lower level of GDP  (Chart 5.11) than was judged probable in February.  Given the observed weakness in productivity over recent quarters, the Committee judges that the outlook for productivity, and so for the supply capacity of the economy, is also weaker than in February.  The Committee continues to judge it likely that some margin of spare capacity, although diminishing, will persist throughout the forecast period. 5.2 Key judgements and risks How much will external price pressures push up on  UK inflation? External price pressures, including substantial increases in commodity prices, have placed significant upward pressure on UK inflation in recent years.  And developments in oil and gas markets since the February Report are likely to put further upward pressure on CPI inflation in coming months.  The path of UK inflation will continue to be sensitive to the evolution of commodity and energy prices throughout the forecast period.  The Committee’s central forecast is conditioned on futures prices for commodities, which point to stable or gradually falling prices over the forecast period.  But there is substantial uncertainty around that outlook.  Some of the commodity price increases — for example, the 25% rise in the oil price since February — predominantly reflected supply factors.  If those constraints ease, prices could fall back more sharply. But there are also upside risks to commodity price inflation, and global inflationary pressure more generally.  Continued robust growth in emerging economies, or an intensification of political instability in key oil-producing regions, may put further upward pressure on the prices of energy or other raw materials, and so on global trade prices.  Overall, the Committee judges that throughout the forecast period, the risks around the outlook for commodity prices, and so for  UK import prices, are skewed to the upside. Even in the absence of further increases in global prices, there is an additional upside risk to UK inflation from external price pressures.  The Committee’s central judgement is that most of the impact on inflation of the depreciation of sterling of around a quarter since mid-2007 has now taken place.  But there is a risk that there is further upward pressure still to come.   How much spare capacity is there within companies, and how will productivity evolve? Offsetting the near-term upward pressure on inflation from higher commodity prices, spare capacity — both within the 300 310 320 330 340 350 360 370 380 390 400 2007 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 £ billions 0 ONS data Bank estimates of past level Projection Chained-volume measure (reference year 2006).  See the footnote to Chart 5.7 for details of the assumptions underlying the projection for GDP growth.  The width of this fan over the past has been calibrated to be consistent with the four-quarter growth fan chart, under the assumption that revisions to quarterly growth are independent of the revisions to previous quarters.  Over the forecast, the mean and modal paths for the level of GDP are consistent with Chart 5.7.  So the skews for the level fan chart have been constructed from the skews in the four-quarter growth fan chart at the one, two and three-year horizons.  This calibration also takes account of the likely path dependency of the economy, where, for example, it is judged that shocks to GDP growth in one quarter will continue to have some effect on GDP growth in successive quarters. This assumption of path dependency serves to widen the fan chart.   Chart 5.11 Projection of the level of GDP based on market interest rate expectations and £200 billion asset purchases  Section 5 Prospects for inflation 43 labour market and within companies — should continue to weigh on prices.  The degree of spare capacity within companies, and its likely evolution, depends crucially on the path of underlying productivity.  Labour productivity is currently substantially below the level implied by a continuation of its pre-recession trend.  If much of that shortfall is cyclical in nature, perhaps reflecting some businesses retaining staff in anticipation of a recovery in demand, then there should be substantial spare capacity within companies.  But surveys of businesses point to a more limited margin of spare capacity (Section 3).  And there has been little sign yet of any cyclical recovery in productivity — indeed, it appears to have weakened further over recent quarters, with employment and the total number of hours worked continuing to rise even as output growth has been subdued. The Committee judges it likely that GDP is currently being underestimated, and that subsequent data revisions will lead Financial and energy market assumptions As a benchmark assumption, the projections for CPI inflation and GDP growth described in Charts 5.1 and 5.7 are conditioned on a path for Bank Rate implied by market interest rates (Table 1).  In the period leading up to the MPC’s May decision, the path implied by forward market interest rates was for Bank Rate to rise to 0.8%, on average, in 2011 Q4.   Bank Rate was assumed to continue to rise thereafter.  The path for Bank Rate at the time of the May Report was  0.3 percentage points lower, on average, than that assumed in the February Report. The May projections are conditioned on an assumption that the total stock of purchased assets financed by the creation of central bank reserves remains at £200 billion throughout the forecast period, the same total scale of purchases assumed in the February projections. The starting point for sterling’s effective exchange rate index (ERI) in the MPC’s projections was 79.5, the average for the fifteen working days to 4 May.  That was 1.8% below the starting point for the February projections.  Under the MPC’s usual convention,(1) the exchange rate is assumed to be similar in 2013 Q2, and is lower throughout the forecast period than assumed in February. The starting point for UK equity prices in the MPC’s projections was 3118 — the average of the FTSE All-Share for the fifteen working days to 4 May.  That was 0.8% above the starting point for the February projection.  In the long run, equity wealth is assumed to grow in line with nominal GDP;  in the short run, it also reflects changes in the share of profits in GDP. Energy prices are assumed to evolve broadly in line with the paths implied by futures markets over the forecast period. Average Brent oil futures prices for the next three years were around 16% higher (in US dollar terms) than at the time of the February Report.  Wholesale gas futures prices were around 18% higher over the forecast period.  The May projections for CPI inflation are conditioned on a benchmark assumption of around a 15% rise in domestic gas prices and a 10% rise in domestic electricity prices during the second half of 2011 and first quarter of 2012.  That compares with an assumption of a 5% increase in domestic gas prices in 2011 Q4 in the February projections.  As noted in Section 4, plausible alternative paths for domestic utility prices would have a significant impact on inflation.   (1) The convention is that the sterling exchange rate follows a path which is half way between the starting level of the sterling ERI and a path implied by interest rate differentials.

If that happens then productivity estimates will probably also be increased.  But the revision would have to be unusually large to account for much of the current shortfall. The Committee’s central view is that some spare capacity remains within companies, but that more than half of the shortfall in productivity, relative to a continuation of its  pre-recession trend, reflects a persistent weakening in the level of underlying productivity.  The remaining cyclical margin of unused capacity means that some businesses could increase output at little extra cost, with an attendant rebound in productivity.  But there are substantial uncertainties around this judgement.  Will the experience of above-target inflation put upward pressure on wages and prices? The presence of a margin of spare capacity should limit the cost to some companies of expanding their output, and should therefore help to moderate domestically generated inflation. But offsetting that, the sustained period of above-target inflation is likely to place some upward pressure on wages and prices, through two channels. First, the protracted period of above-target inflation has contributed to exceptional weakness in households’ real income growth (Section 2), with further falls in real disposable incomes in prospect over the first half of the forecast period as inflation remains elevated.  Such a squeeze of households’ purchasing power was inevitable, given the substantial increases in commodity and import prices, the weakening in productivity, and the effects of the fiscal consolidation. Nonetheless, it is likely to result in some upward pressure on nominal wages, as employees try to resist the erosion of their real incomes, or employers feel the need to raise wages in order to retain or motivate their staff.    Second, the sustained period of above-target inflation may cause expectations of inflation to drift upwards.  And, to the extent that people place weight on past outturns in forming their expectations, it may then take time for inflation expectations to decline again, even as inflation itself falls back. Higher expectations of inflation could lead employers and employees to agree larger increases in wages.  Or they may feed more directly into higher inflation, if companies set higher prices in anticipation of their competitors and suppliers doing likewise.   The degree to which elevated past inflation will push up wages and prices through these channels is uncertain.  But the Committee judges that these effects will put some upward pressure on inflation, particularly during the first half of the forecast period, implying that countervailing downward pressure from a margin of spare capacity would be needed in order to keep inflation at the target.  And the risks to inflation from such second-round effects are judged to be skewed to the upside throughout the forecast period.   Section 5 Prospects for inflation 45 How much will labour market slack bear down on wages? Despite elevated inflation, wage growth has, so far, remained subdued.  In part, that is likely to have reflected the weakness in productivity growth.  But it has probably also been linked to the substantial increase in unemployment.  A key determinant of inflation in the medium term will be the degree to which persistent labour market slack continues to bear down on wages. The path of unemployment will depend, in part, on the extent to which underlying productivity recovers.  A recovery would limit companies’ need to hire new staff to increase output, and would therefore imply continued slack in the labour market, exerting downward pressure on wage growth. Even if unemployment does remain elevated, however, the drag that it exerts on wage growth is likely to diminish over time.  People who have been unemployed for a long period are less able to acquire or retain the skills needed by employers. And some of the unemployed may become discouraged and so search less hard for work.  If unemployment remains high, those effects are likely to become progressively more significant over the forecast period, so that the rate of unemployment consistent with inflation meeting the target would rise.  Overall, the Committee’s central judgement is that wage growth is likely to pick up from its current level.  Nonetheless, a persistent margin of slack is likely to cause earnings growth to remain a little below its recent historical average rate throughout the forecast period.  Given the uncertainties around the forces affecting earnings, there are substantial risks in both directions around those judgements, and the Committee judges that those risks are skewed towards a weaker path for wage growth and so domestic inflationary pressure. How fast will private domestic demand grow? The margin of spare capacity in the economy will depend on the path of productivity, but also, crucially, on the strength of demand.  The continuing fiscal consolidation can be expected to weigh directly on demand, as growth in public consumption and investment slows.  But offsetting that to some degree, a recovery in business investment appears to be under way. Business investment remains around 20% below its level at the end of 2007, and the corporate sector continues to run an unusually large financial surplus.  The Committee judges that those conditions point to the recovery in business investment gathering pace, and providing a significant boost to growth throughout the forecast period.  Around two thirds of domestic demand is accounted for by household consumption, however.  Consumption stagnated throughout 2010, remaining some 4% below its pre-recession  46 Inflation Report  May 2011 peak — the largest such shortfall at this stage of a recovery since quarterly records began in 1955.  A number of factors probably contributed to that exceptional weakness, including the pronounced squeeze in households’ real incomes, uncertainty regarding future incomes, and in response, some households attempting to reduce their debt levels (Section 2). The Committee’s central judgement is that consumption will remain broadly flat during the early part of the forecast period, as real disposable incomes continue to be squeezed, and households’ adjustment to their lower purchasing power continues.  Further ahead, consumption is likely to recover only gradually, regaining its pre-recession peak only near the end of the forecast period.  But there are substantial uncertainties around that assessment, in both directions. Consumption growth could turn out stronger, if uncertainty about future incomes declines more rapidly, or if spending receives a larger boost from the substantial corporate financial surplus, for instance if more of it is distributed in the form of higher wages or dividends.  But there are also significant risks to the downside, given uncertainty about the impact of the fiscal consolidation, continuing limitations on the availability of credit, and the possibility that even less of the adjustment to lower real incomes has so far taken place.  Overall, the risks around the most likely path for consumption are judged to be skewed to the downside, especially in the early part of the forecast period, when real income growth is likely to be weakest, and uncertainty about the impact of the fiscal consolidation may be most pronounced.  How much support will net exports provide to the recovery? The pace of the recovery in demand will also depend crucially on the support from net exports.  UK services exports remained weak during 2010, in part reflecting continued weakness in exports of financial services.  But exports of goods grew by over 10%, and the Committee judges that export growth should remain robust throughout the forecast period, as exporters continue to benefit from the global recovery and the past depreciation of sterling.  Risks around the strength of global demand remain, however, in particular in the euro area, the United Kingdom’s largest export market.  Some euro-area periphery countries continue to face substantial challenges  in improving their competitiveness and fiscal positions  (Section 2).  A further weakening in growth in those economies could weigh on UK demand, both through direct trade linkages, but also through effects on confidence here and in the euro area, and through financial market and banking sector linkages.  The support to the recovery from net exports will also depend on the extent to which UK import growth slows in response to the sharp increase in import prices following sterling’s depreciation.  The large swings in UK domestic demand, and their impact on the demand for imports, make it difficult to  Section 5 Prospects for inflation 47 isolate the effect of higher import prices with any precision. But imports appear, so far at least, to have remained stronger than might have been expected.  Trade data are subject to both substantial measurement error and subsequent revision, so it is possible that imports have actually been weaker than the data currently suggest.  But it is also possible that the resilience of imports reflects a present lack of suitable domestic substitutes for goods and services that are currently imported.  The Committee believes that the supply of such products should increase over the forecast period, enabling more significant switching of expenditure away from imports. Together with vigorous export growth, that would mean that net exports make a substantial contribution to GDP growth throughout the forecast period.  But the risks around that contribution from net exports are judged to be weighted to the downside.        5.3 Summary and the policy decision CPI inflation is expected to remain above the target throughout 2011 and 2012, given the rise in VAT and increases in import and energy prices.  Inflation should fall back as the impact of the temporary factors supporting it declines, and spare capacity continues to weigh on prices and wages.  But the extent of the fall in inflation will depend on the size, persistence and impact of spare capacity, and on the scale of second-round effects from the sustained period of  above-target inflation.  There is a high degree of uncertainty, and an unusually wide range of views among Committee members, about the strength of these various forces, and therefore around the overall outlook for inflation.  The Committee’s best collective judgement is that, conditioned on market interest rates, the chances of inflation being either above or below the target are broadly equal in the medium term. Charts 5.12 and 5.13 show the GDP and CPI inflation projections for the next two years under the alternative assumption that Bank Rate is held constant at 0.5%.  Under that assumption for monetary policy, inflation is more likely to be above the target than below it at the two-year point. In evaluating the outlook for inflation, the Committee will focus on:  measures of inflation expectations, and their impact on prices and wages;  evidence regarding the evolution of potential supply and spare capacity, including the outturns for employment and investment;  and indicators of global inflationary pressure. In evaluating the outlook for growth, the Committee will focus on indicators of:  the extent to which the recent slowing in growth is temporary;  the likely path of household consumption and saving;  and the degree to which both exports and imports are responding to the past depreciation of sterling. 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 2007 08 09 10 11 12 13 Percentage increases in output on a year earlier + – Projection Bank estimates of past growth ONS data See footnote to Chart 5.7.

Chart 5.13 CPI inflation projection based on constant nominal interest rates at 0.5% and £200 billion asset purchases  48 Inflation Report  May 2011 At its May meeting, the Committee judged that the pace of recovery was more likely than not to pick up from its recent soft patch.  The near-term outlook for inflation had worsened further, primarily reflecting renewed increases in energy prices. But under the assumption that Bank Rate rose in line with market yields, inflation was still likely to fall back in the medium term, as the temporary impacts of the factors currently raising inflation diminished and some downward pressure from a margin of spare capacity persisted.  In the light of that outlook, the Committee judged it appropriate at that meeting to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5% and the stock of purchased assets at £200 billion, in order to meet the  2% CPI inflation target over the medium term.   Section 5 Prospects for inflation 49 Other forecasters’ expectations Every three months, the Bank asks a sample of external forecasters for their latest economic projections.  This box reports the results of the most recent survey, carried out during April.  On average, CPI inflation was expected to fall back to 2.1% by 2012 Q2 and to remain slightly above the 2% target over the following two years (Table 1).  Those expectations were marginally higher than three months earlier. And the dispersion of central views about CPI inflation  one year ahead was wider than three months earlier (Chart A). But the distribution of views about inflation three years ahead was little changed. On average, forecasters expected four-quarter GDP growth to be 2.1% at the one-year horizon, rising to 2.5% in 2014 Q2. These averages were similar to those in February. Almost all forecasters expected Bank Rate to have risen by 2012 Q2, with further increases predicted over the following two years.  On average, the sterling ERI was projected to appreciate gradually over the next three years. The Bank also asks forecasters for an assessment of the risks around their central projections for CPI inflation and GDP growth (Table 2).  On average, respondents judged that inflation was slightly more likely to be above the target than to be below it throughout the next three years.  Over recent quarters there has been an increase in the average probability attached to inflation being above 3% three years ahead, despite relatively little change in the average central projection (Chart B).  The average probability of growth  one year ahead being above 2% was slightly higher than  three months earlier, but the probability distribution for growth beyond that was little changed.

2012-05-16,"Inflation Report May 2012   BANK OF ENGLAND Inflation Report May 2012 In order to maintain price stability, the Government has set the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) a target for the annual inflation rate of the Consumer Prices Index of 2%. Subject to that, the MPC is also required to support the Government’s objective of maintaining high and stable growth and employment. The Inflation Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff under the guidance of the members of the Monetary Policy Committee.  It serves two purposes.  First, its preparation provides a comprehensive and forward-looking framework for discussion among MPC members as an aid to our decision making.  Second, its publication allows us to share our thinking and explain the reasons for our decisions to those whom they affect. Although not every member will agree with every assumption on which our projections are based, the fan charts represent the MPC’s best collective judgement about the most likely paths for inflation and output, and the uncertainties surrounding those central projections. This Report has been prepared and published by the Bank of England in accordance with  section 18 of the Bank of England Act 1998.

The European Central Bank’s longer-term refinancing operations were associated with an initial improvement in bank funding conditions, although some indicators of unsecured funding costs subsequently picked up. Spreads on some euro-area countries’ government debt remained elevated.  UK banks raised significant funds from debt markets in 2012 Q1.  They continued to pass through earlier rises in their funding costs to mortgage rates.  Money growth picked up in Q1;  credit growth remained weak. Sterling has appreciated by 3% since the February Report.  Demand Global growth remained uneven across different regions. Output in the euro area — the United Kingdom’s most important trading partner — contracted in 2011 Q4 and business surveys pointed to a further fall in 2012 Q1.  In contrast, the US economy recorded solid increases, supported by household spending.  Activity in the emerging economies Output had barely grown for a year and a half and was estimated to have contracted slightly in the past two quarters.  The euro-area economy remained weak, but global activity overall continued to expand at a moderate pace.  A number of one-off factors are likely to affect the pattern of quarterly growth of domestic output during 2012.  Looking through those effects, underlying demand growth is likely to remain subdued in the near term, before a gentle increase in households’ real incomes and consumption helps the recovery to gain traction.  Stimulus from monetary policy should continue to support demand, although headwinds from the external environment, tight credit conditions and the fiscal consolidation are likely to persist.  The possibility that the substantial challenges within the euro area will lead to significant economic and financial disruption continues to pose the greatest threat to the UK recovery.  CPI inflation stood at 3.5% in March 2012, down from a peak of 5.2% in September 2011.  That fall reflected the effects of earlier increases in energy prices and VAT dropping out of the twelve-month inflation rate.  The prospects for inflation are uncertain.  The near-term outlook is judged to be somewhat higher than expected three months ago, with inflation now likely to remain above the 2% target for the next year or so.  But a gradual easing in the impact of external price pressures, together with a continuing drag from economic slack, should lead inflation to fall back to around the target.  Under the assumptions that Bank Rate moves in line with market interest rates and the size of the asset purchase programme remains at £325 billion, the risks of inflation being above or below the target by the end of the forecast period are judged to be broadly balanced.   6 Inflation Report  May 2012 expanded steadily, albeit more slowly than at the beginning of last year.  UK exports grew modestly in 2011, underpinned by solid export growth to non-EU countries.  At home, GDP growth was weak during 2011.  That weakness was concentrated within domestic demand.  Consumption fell, as the squeeze on real incomes continued and households saved more.  And business investment remained significantly below its pre-crisis level, held back by weak demand, heightened uncertainty and tight credit conditions.   Output was provisionally estimated to have fallen by 0.2% in 2012 Q1, the second consecutive quarter of contraction.  That fall was driven by a large decline in measured construction output.  Growth in the rest of the economy was also estimated to be weak, with manufacturing and services output both broadly flat.  But business surveys, labour market developments and reports from the Bank’s Agents all pointed to somewhat stronger activity in the first quarter, suggesting that the underlying picture was less weak.  The Committee’s projections are conditioned on the tax and spending plans set out in the March Budget.  Those plans suggest that the reduction in the fiscal deficit as a proportion of nominal GDP is likely to be a little slower in 2012/13 than in the previous two years.  The outlook for GDP growth Chart 1 shows the Committee’s best collective judgement for four-quarter GDP growth, assuming that Bank Rate follows a path implied by market interest rates and the size of the asset purchase programme stays at £325 billion.  The pattern of quarterly growth in 2012 is likely to be affected by a number of one-off factors, including the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee and the Olympics.  Looking through those effects, underlying growth is likely to remain subdued in the near term before a gentle increase in households’ real incomes and consumption helps the recovery to gain traction.  Stimulus from monetary policy should help to support activity, but continued strains within the euro area, tight credit conditions and the fiscal consolidation are all likely to temper the pace of expansion. The prospects for UK growth remain unusually uncertain.  The single biggest threat to the recovery stems from the challenges within the euro area, in particular the need to reduce the indebtedness and improve the competitiveness of some member countries.  Even if a credible and effective set of policies is successfully implemented, the scale of the necessary adjustments suggests that a prolonged period of sluggish growth and heightened uncertainty is likely.  A failure to implement such policies could have severe implications for the UK economy.  As was the case in past Reports, the MPC sees no meaningful way to quantify the size and likelihood of the most extreme possibilities associated with developments in the euro area, and they are therefore excluded from the fan charts.  But the threat of these more extreme outcomes is 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 2008 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 Percentage increases in output on a year earlier Projection Bank estimates of past growth ONS data + – Chart 1 GDP projection based on market interest rate expectations and £325 billion asset purchases The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for GDP growth.  It has been conditioned on the assumption that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remains at £325 billion throughout the forecast period. To the left of the first vertical dashed line, the distribution reflects the likelihood of revisions to the data over the past;  to the right, it reflects uncertainty over the evolution of GDP growth in the future.  If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that the mature estimate of GDP growth would lie within the darkest central band on only 10 of those occasions.  The fan chart is constructed so that outturns are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter green areas on 10 occasions.  In any particular quarter of the forecast period, GDP growth is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fan on 90 out of 100 occasions.  And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions GDP growth can fall anywhere outside the green area of the fan chart.  Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey background.  In any quarter of the forecast period, the probability mass in each pair of identically coloured bands sums to 10%.  The distribution of that 10% between the bands below and above the central projection varies according to the skew at each quarter, with the distribution given by the ratio of the width of the bands below the central projection to the bands above it.  In Chart 1, the probabilities in the lower bands are the same as those in the upper bands at Years 1, 2 and 3. See the box on page 39 of the November 2007 Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.  The second dashed line is drawn at the two-year point of the projection.  Overview 7 likely to affect economic activity over the forecast period, for example through its effect on asset prices, including the exchange rate, bank funding costs, and confidence;  such effects are captured in the MPC’s projections.    Domestically, the strength of the recovery will depend on whether households have further to adjust to the erosion in their purchasing power and to the more uncertain economic environment.  The path of domestic spending will also depend on:  the pace of productivity growth and how that affects households’ and companies’ earnings;  the extent to which the availability of bank credit improves;  and the effects on growth of both fiscal and monetary policy.  There remains a range of views among Committee members about the outlook for GDP growth.  On the same assumptions as above, the Committee’s best collective judgement is that growth is likely to remain subdued in the near term, but that by the third year of the forecast, the chances of GDP growth being above or below its historical average are broadly balanced.  The projected distribution for growth is lower than in the February Inflation Report, reflecting weaker growth around the start of this year, a higher near-term outlook for inflation and a more gradual pickup in productivity growth. Recent growth has been weak by historical standards.  Chart 2 shows that output has been broadly flat since the middle of 2010 and is not likely to surpass its pre-crisis level before 2014. The weakness appears to have been associated with unusually slow growth in potential supply.  Even so, the Committee judges that there exists a sizable margin of spare capacity, largely concentrated in the labour market.  That should diminish towards the end of the forecast period, but is unlikely to close completely.    Costs and prices CPI inflation stood at 3.5% in March 2012, down from 5.2% in September 2011.  That fall reflected the effects of earlier increases in energy prices and VAT dropping out of the  twelve-month comparison.  The elevated rate of inflation in March largely reflected the effects of past increases in import and energy prices.  In contrast, there had not been strong growth in domestic costs:  companies’ unit labour costs had increased at around their average historical rate over the past year.  Most indicators of longer-term inflation expectations remained relatively close to their series averages. Private sector employment has increased substantially since the middle of 2010, despite weak output growth.  The Labour Force Survey measure of unemployment edged lower in the three months to February.  Even so, there remained a wide margin of slack in the labour market and this, along with weak productivity growth, continued to bear down on earnings growth, which declined further in early 2012.   320 330 340 350 360 370 380 390 400 410 420 2006 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 £ billions  ONS data Projection Bank estimates of past level 0 Chained-volume measure (reference year 2008).  See the footnote to Chart 1 for details of the assumptions underlying the projection for GDP growth.  The width of this fan over the past has been calibrated to be consistent with the four-quarter growth fan chart, under the assumption that revisions to quarterly growth are independent of the revisions to previous quarters.  Over the forecast, the mean and modal paths for the level of GDP are consistent with Chart 1.  So the skews for the level fan chart have been constructed from the skews in the four-quarter growth fan chart at the one, two and three-year horizons.  This calibration also takes account of the likely path dependency of the economy, where, for example, it is judged that shocks to GDP growth in one quarter will continue to have some effect on GDP growth in successive quarters.  This assumption of path dependency serves to widen the fan chart.   Chart 2 Projection of the level of GDP based on market interest rate expectations and £325 billion asset purchases  8 Inflation Report  May 2012 The outlook for inflation Chart 3 shows the Committee’s best collective judgement of the outlook for CPI inflation, based on the same assumptions as Chart 1.  The near-term outlook is higher than in the February Report, with inflation likely to remain above the  2% target for the next year or so.  This upward revision reflects both the impact of higher energy prices and indirect taxes, and also a judgement that cost pressures from past rises in commodity prices and weak productivity are likely to have a greater impact on inflation in the near term than expected three months ago.  But a gradual easing in the impact of external price pressures and a continuing drag from economic slack should cause inflation to fall back to around the target in the second half of the forecast period. The prospects for inflation remain uncertain, not least because it is difficult to gauge with any precision the current strength of underlying inflationary pressure.  The extent to which inflation slows in the near term depends on the pace at which external price pressures ease, and hence on developments in commodity and other import prices.  The path of inflation will also depend on the growth in companies’ domestic costs, which will be heavily affected by the pace of productivity growth and the extent to which slack in the labour market limits wage growth.  The degree to which companies seek to restore their profit margins by raising prices will also have an important bearing on inflation.   The difficulty of predicting the precise impact of these influences means that the Committee places more weight on the broad shape of the inflation outlook than its exact calibration.  And there remains a range of views among Committee members regarding the relative strength of different factors.  On balance, however, the Committee’s best collective judgement, based on the conditioning assumptions described above, is that by the end of the forecast period, the risks of inflation being above or below the 2% target are broadly balanced (Chart 4).  The policy decision At its May meeting, the Committee noted that, despite the changes in the near-term outlook, the fundamental policy challenges following the financial crisis and subsequent recession remained the same.  GDP growth was likely to remain weak in the near term and to strengthen gradually thereafter.  Developments in the euro area continued to pose a significant threat to that outlook.  Inflation had declined sharply since last autumn, broadly as the Committee had expected.  And although inflation was likely to remain above 2% for the next year or so, it was nevertheless likely to fall back gradually to around the target.  The Committee therefore decided that it was appropriate to maintain Bank Rate at  0.5% and the size of the asset purchase programme at  £325 billion in order to meet the 2% CPI inflation target over the medium term.  0 20 40 60 80 100 2012 Q2  13 14 15 Q3  Q1  Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1  Q2 Q3 Q4  Q1  Q2  Q4  Per cent February Inﬂation Report  May Inﬂation Report  The May and February swathes in this chart are derived from the same distributions as Chart 3 and Chart 5.7 on page 41 respectively.  They indicate the assessed probability of inflation being above target in each quarter of the forecast period.  The 5 percentage points width of the swathes reflects the fact that there is uncertainty about the precise probability in any given quarter, but they should not be interpreted as confidence intervals.  The dashed line is drawn at the two-year point of the May projection.  The two-year point of the February projection was one quarter earlier.

It has been conditioned on the assumption that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remains at £325 billion throughout the forecast period.  If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that inflation in any particular quarter would lie within the darkest central band on only 10 of those occasions.  The fan chart is constructed so that outturns of inflation are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter red areas on 10 occasions.  In any particular quarter of the forecast period, inflation is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fan on 90 out of 100 occasions.  And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions inflation can fall anywhere outside the red area of the fan chart.  Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey background.

In Chart 3, the probabilities in the upper bands are the same as those in the lower bands at Year 1 but they are slightly larger at Years 2 and 3.

The dashed line is drawn at the two-year point.  1 Money and asset prices Section 1 Money and asset prices 9 Since the February Report, the MPC has maintained Bank Rate at 0.5% and the size of its programme of asset purchases at £325 billion (Section 1.1).  Section 1.2 discusses how asset purchases may have affected money growth.  Although the European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) three-year longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) boosted financial market sentiment in early 2012, that effect has begun to wane and concerns about the indebtedness and competitiveness of several euro-area countries have intensified again in recent weeks (Section 1.3).  The LTROs helped to improve funding conditions for banks in Q1, but funding costs remained high. Elevated funding costs have led to a tightening in credit conditions for households and companies (Section 1.4). 1.1 Monetary policy The MPC has maintained Bank Rate at 0.5% since the February Report.  Although overnight index swap rates suggest that the point at which Bank Rate is expected to increase has been brought forward marginally over the past three months, it is not expected to start rising until 2013 (Chart 1.1). The MPC has also maintained the size of its programme of asset purchases financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at £325 billion.  Around three quarters of respondents to the Reuters poll of economists taken on 3 May did not expect any further expansion in the size of the programme. Among those who did expect further asset purchases, the median expectation was for an additional £50 billion in total. The reasons behind the MPC’s recent policy decisions are discussed in more detail in the box on page 10.   The MPC’s asset purchases seek to boost asset prices and, over time, support nominal spending.(1) Initially, investors sell gilts to the Bank and that increases their money holdings.  But Since the February Report, the MPC has maintained Bank Rate at 0.5% and the size of its programme of asset purchases at £325 billion.  ECB operations eased strains in sovereign debt and bank funding markets, although much of the improvement in government bond markets subsequently reversed amid renewed concerns about some euro-area countries.  Conditions in bank funding markets improved in 2012 Q1, but banks continued to pass through past increases in funding costs into loan rates.

(1) The transmission mechanism of asset purchases is described in more detail in the box on pages 12–13 of the November 2011 Report.  10 Inflation Report  May 2012 Monetary policy since the February Report The MPC’s central projection in the February Report, under the assumptions that Bank Rate followed a path implied by market interest rates and that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remained at £325 billion, was that growth was likely to remain weak in the near term before gradually strengthening thereafter.  Under the same assumptions, the MPC judged that inflation was likely to continue to decline from its recent peak during 2012. Near-term global activity indicators released over the month prior to the MPC’s meeting on 7–8 March had developed broadly as expected and continued to point to a gradual recovery in growth.  In the United Kingdom, following the 0.2% fall in GDP in 2011 Q4, business surveys remained consistent with a resumption of growth in both services and manufacturing in the first quarter of 2012. CPI inflation had fallen to 3.6% in January from its recent peak of 5.2% in September.  That decline reflected, in part, the effect of the previous year’s rise in the standard rate of VAT dropping out of the twelve-month comparison.  There was less certainty about the extent and pace at which inflation would fall subsequently, although the Committee’s central view was that inflation would fall further as the contributions of energy and import prices continued to wane and as spare capacity weighed on wages and prices.  A clear risk to the inflation outlook surrounded the outlook  for crude oil prices.  The price of Brent crude oil had increased by around 12% since the end of January, which appeared to have been primarily driven by supply factors.  Any worsening  of the underlying tensions in the Middle East could have significant implications for future oil prices and CPI inflation. Domestically, there was a risk that labour market slack might be a less powerful restraining force on earnings growth and inflation in the future.  Set against that, there were significant risks to economic activity that might result in inflation falling materially below the target in the medium term, in particular, related to enduring concerns about the indebtedness and competitiveness of some euro-area countries. Overall, the Committee judged that the recent data had evolved in line with its expectations and that there had been little change to the balance of risks to UK activity and inflation. Most members saw no reason to change the stance of monetary policy.  But two members continued to think that a larger monetary stimulus was warranted to reduce the risk that persistently weak growth would damage the future supply capacity of the economy.  The Committee voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%.  Seven members voted to continue with the programme of asset purchases totalling £325 billion.  Two preferred to increase the size of the programme by £25 billion. Ahead of the MPC’s meeting on 4–5 April, there had been downside news on the near-term path of GDP likely to be published by the ONS.  There had been unexpected falls in the ONS’s measures of output in manufacturing and, in particular, construction.  It was possible that the ONS’s preliminary estimate for GDP could record a fall in aggregate output.  But a wide range of survey indicators pointed to a moderate rate of growth in activity in the first half of the year and underlying aggregate activity growth was likely, if anything, to have picked up since the second half of 2011. CPI inflation had fallen to 3.4% in February.  But the fall since September had been slightly less than the Committee had expected.  There was a risk that inflation would fall less rapidly in the near term than anticipated in the February Report. Recent rises in oil and gas prices and the additional increase in duties announced in the Budget would put upward pressure on inflation.  Some statistical projections were pointing to a path for CPI inflation in the coming months somewhat above the central path contained in the February Report. The speed at which inflation would return towards target could not be judged with any precision and there were risks on both sides.  To the upside, elevated inflation might be more persistent than the Committee expected if there were further shocks to oil or other commodity prices or if there was greater pass-through of external price pressures to consumer prices. Domestically, companies could seek to rebuild margins more aggressively than anticipated.  To the downside, the risk was that demand would not be strong enough to absorb the considerable margin of spare capacity in the economy, especially given that there was a risk that business and household sentiment could be further dented either by media reports of the economy re-entering recession or by deterioration in the situation in the euro area.  While the news about the near-term path for inflation was unwelcome, for most members there was little solid  evidence yet that the balance of risks to inflation in the medium term had changed.  Eight members of the Committee voted to continue with the £325 billion asset purchase programme and maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%.  One member preferred to increase the size of the asset purchase programme by a further £25 billion, although the decision was finely balanced. At its meeting on 9–10 May, the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%.  The Committee also voted to maintain the stock of asset purchases financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at £325 billion.  Section 1 Money and asset prices 11 investors are likely then to reinvest the proceeds in other assets, such as equities or corporate bonds, putting upward pressure on the prices of those assets.  That reduces borrowing costs and makes it easier for companies to raise funds in the capital markets.  But many other factors also affect asset prices, making it difficult to isolate the precise impact of the gilt purchases.   1.2 Money Broad money growth has been volatile in recent quarters, mainly reflecting sharp movements in the money holdings of non-intermediate other financial corporations (Chart 1.2).  Part of that volatility reflects large intragroup transfers of funding by some financial institutions at the end of 2011 that reduced money growth in Q4.  Households’ contribution to broad money growth picked up slightly in 2012 Q1 to its highest level since 2008 Q2.  The contribution of private non-financial corporations’ (PNFCs’) money was similar to its average over the past three years. The MPC’s gilt purchases in Q4 and Q1 were associated with a reduction in the gilt holdings of the non-bank private sector (Table 1.A).  That should have boosted their money holdings. But it is hard to be sure what would have happened in the absence of the MPC’s asset purchases.  For instance, some investors may otherwise have used their deposits to buy gilts, as they did over the preceding year.  As a consequence, the impact of the MPC’s gilt purchases on money is necessarily uncertain.   The overall increase in the stock of money since asset purchases were restarted in October has been smaller than the value of gilts purchased by the Bank.  Broad money increased by only £19 billion over Q4 and Q1, while the Bank purchased £105 billion of gilts.  There are a number of explanations as to why money growth was so weak.  First, the MPC’s asset purchases have coincided with banks, as well as the non-bank private sector, holding fewer gilts (Table 1.A).  If banks sell gilts to the Bank and simply retain the proceeds then that does not add to the money supply:  rather, there is just a change in the composition of banks’ assets.  Second, money growth could have been weaker than might have been expected given the amount of asset purchases because of a change in the behaviour of non-residents.  Non-residents’ sterling deposits, which are not measured as money, have risen recently, which could be because they have bought fewer gilts than they would have done in the absence of the MPC’s asset purchases.  Third, companies issuing bonds and using the proceeds to pay down bank debt (Section 1.4) will also have depressed money growth.   The implications of those different explanations for weak money growth vary, but they need not imply that the  MPC’s asset purchases are less effective.  For example, if  non-residents eventually reinvest their additional sterling deposits in other sterling assets, that would have the same Table 1.A Quarterly changes in gilt holdings by sector(a) £ billions Averages 2009 Q1– 2010 Q2– 2010 Q1 2011 Q3 2011 Q4 2012 Q1 Bank of England(b) 40 0 51 54 Non-bank private sector -6 10 -29 -27 Banks and building societies 6 10 -11 -4 Non-residents 9 14 18 3 Sales by Debt Management Office(c) 49 34 30 26 Sources:  Bank of England and Debt Management Office.

Those operations, conducted in December 2011 and February 2012, eased strains in bank funding markets and contributed to rises in asset prices.  But with concerns about the indebtedness and competitiveness of several euro-area countries intensifying again more recently, some of those asset price increases have unwound since March. Euro-area government bonds In the run-up to the May Report, government bond yields in the euro-area periphery countries were below their peaks reached in the second half of 2011 (Chart 1.3).  Market contacts suggest that those falls largely reflected the LTROs because they reduced the likelihood that vulnerable banks in those countries would require additional government support. In addition, some banks in Italy and Spain were reported to have invested funds raised from the LTROs in domestic sovereign debt.   Nonetheless, sovereign bond spreads over German government bond yields have remained elevated in the  euro-area periphery countries, and Spanish and Italian spreads have risen again since March (Chart 1.3).  Elevated spreads reflect continuing concerns about the indebtedness and competitiveness of these countries.  Greek and Portuguese spreads remain particularly high.  And the recent increases in Spanish and Italian spreads could reflect a growing recognition that the LTROs will not resolve the fundamental challenges facing the euro-area periphery countries. UK government bonds Gilt yields remain close to historically low levels (Chart 1.4). Domestic and international factors are both likely to have depressed yields.  Domestically, the MPC’s asset purchase programme and expectations that official interest rates will remain low (Section 1.1) have reduced gilt yields.  The current level of yields could also reflect expectations of weak output growth in the longer term:  the implied cost of government borrowing for five years in five years’ time is also close to historically low levels (Chart 1.4), largely reflecting low real rates.  Internationally, persistent concerns about euro-area periphery countries have contributed to strong demand for sovereign bonds — including those of the United Kingdom — that are perceived as more liquid or carrying little credit risk. That is also likely to have contributed to the current depressed level of gilt yields. The £50 billion expansion of the MPC’s asset purchase programme announced on 9 February was widely anticipated Chart 1.3 Selected European ten-year spot government bond yields(a) 0  2  4  6  8  10  12  14  16  18  Jan.

Total expected Bank purchases on each date are assumed to be split evenly across the maturity sectors in use at the time and, within that, evenly across eligible gilts (those for which the Bank did not hold over 70% of the free float). For each maturity, the chart shows the estimated change in purchases of all local gilts.  Section 1 Money and asset prices 13 by market participants and is therefore likely to have been priced into gilt yields in advance.  Consistent with that, there was little discernable effect on gilt yields, on average, following the announcement. A change in the maturity structure of the gilts to be purchased by the MPC was also announced on 9 February.  That change — made to reduce the risk of undesirable frictions in gilt market functioning arising from the concentration of the Bank’s holdings in certain maturity sectors — involved the Bank buying more gilts at short maturities and fewer at longer maturities.  Specifically, the Bank moved from purchasing  gilts equally across three sectors of 3–10 years, 10–25 years and greater than 25 years, to buying evenly across sectors  of 3–7 years, 7–15 years and greater than 15 years.  The  new maturity sectors were the same as those used by the  Debt Management Office.   In the two days following the 9 February announcement, shorter-term gilt yields fell and longer-term yields rose (Chart 1.5).  As the adjustment of maturity sectors was not widely expected by financial markets, the change in the shape of the yield curve following the announcement provides further evidence that asset purchases affect gilt yields.(1) It is consistent with recent asset purchases by the MPC having put downward pressure on gilt yields, even though anticipation effects make it difficult to identify exactly when those changes occurred. Equities and corporate bonds In the run-up to the May Report, UK equity prices were similar to their level at the time of the February Report, but had risen by over 10% since the MPC restarted asset purchases in October (Chart 1.6).  Equity prices had increased over the  past three months in the United States, possibly because of some better-than-expected macroeconomic data there. Bond spreads and yields for UK non-financial investment-grade companies were similar in the run-up to the May Report to those at the time of the February Report (Chart 1.7). Conditions in corporate bond markets have improved since the turn of the year, which may partly reflect the MPC’s asset purchase programme.  It may also reflect a post-LTROs improvement in sentiment, although some of that improvement has unwound since March.  Falls in the cost of raising bond finance are likely to have supported issuance in Q1, which was robust (Section 1.4). Exchange rates The sterling effective exchange rate has risen by around 3% since the February Report (Chart 1.8).

The sterling ERI is now close to the top of the relatively narrow range that it has moved within following the 25% depreciation between mid-2007 and the end of 2008. The banking sector Conditions in bank funding markets have improved since the turn of the year.  These markets were strained during the second half of 2011, as concerns about the impact of euro-area developments made it difficult for banks to raise funding.  For some banks, public unsecured markets were effectively closed, and the cost of the secured and private funding that was issued was high.  In the euro area, the first three-year LTRO in late December eased the immediate funding challenges facing banks.  Banks also had the opportunity to participate in a second operation in late February.  Taken together, the ECB  lent around €1 trillion to euro-area banks in the two operations, although the net injection was around €500 billion after taking account of maturing ECB funding. The LTROs also led to an improvement in sentiment in UK bank funding markets, which was reflected in strong debt issuance in 2012 Q1.  The major UK banks issued around £50 billion of debt in public markets, similar to the quarterly average in the first half of 2011 and well above the average of £19 billion in the final two quarters of 2011 (Chart 1.9).  And there was greater public unsecured issuance in Q1 than in the entire second half of 2011, although secured issuance still accounted for the majority of funding.  Private markets also continued to be an important source of funding for UK banks and some raised funds from the LTROs through their foreign subsidiaries.  In 2012, several banks are planning to reduce the size of their balance sheets;  most banks are planning to increase their reliance on retail deposits;  and the amount of term debt due to mature is smaller than in 2011.  Consequently, banks plan to raise less wholesale term funding this year than in 2011, and they have already raised a significant proportion of that planned funding.   Bank funding costs have fallen from their late-2011 peaks, although, on average, they remain elevated relative to reference rates (Chart 1.10).  Credit default swap (CDS) premia and spreads on retail funding remain higher than in the first half of 2011, but covered bond spreads have fallen back to 2011 H1 levels.  Section 5 discusses the outlook for funding costs.   Elevated funding costs are likely, initially, to reduce banks’  mark-ups on new loans but then put upward pressure on the interest rates on new loans as banks seek to restore margins. For example, using the sum of three-month Libor and UK banks’ average CDS premia as a proxy for their marginal funding cost, it appears that the average interest rate on a new Bank Rate tracker mortgage was close to the marginal funding cost in Chart 1.9 Public term issuance by the major  UK lenders(a) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 2006 07 08 09 10 11 12 Secured(c) Unsecured(b) £ billions Sources:  Bank of England, Dealogic and Bank calculations.

Section 1 Money and asset prices 15 April 2012 (Chart 1.11).(1) There are, however, a number of caveats around such a calculation.  For instance, it does not take account of the recent falls in the relative cost of secured funding, and there is likely to be significant dispersion in funding costs and mark-ups across individual banks. Nevertheless, in the absence of falls in funding costs, it suggests that some further increase in mortgage rates is likely as banks seek to restore their margins. 1.4 Credit conditions Credit conditions have tightened somewhat since 2011 Q3, as interest rates on bank loans for companies and on mortgages have increased.  But the price of unsecured loans for households has not risen. Corporate sector finances The majority of lenders responding to the Bank’s Credit Conditions Survey reported that spreads over reference rates on corporate loans rose in 2011 Q4 and 2012 Q1 (Table 1.B). For large and medium-sized companies, those increases appear to have reversed part of the fall in spreads on loans seen during most of 2010 and the first three quarters of 2011.  Some further widening in spreads on loans to companies of all sizes was expected in 2012 Q2. Bank borrowing by companies fell sharply in 2012 Q1 (Chart 1.12).  The stock of all currency loans had been declining at a decreasing rate during 2011, but the 2.4% fall in Q1 was the largest quarterly fall since 2009 Q3.  A higher cost of bank loans, combined with improved conditions in bond markets (Section 1.3), may have encouraged some companies to substitute bond finance for bank loans.  Corporate bond issuance was robust in Q1, but not strong enough to offset the fall in bank borrowing, so that total finance raised by PNFCs fell back in Q1 after increasing in Q4 (Chart 1.12).   Small companies do not generally have access to capital markets and are therefore more reliant on bank borrowing than large companies.  The Credit Conditions Survey implies that, even prior to the recent tightening, there had been no fall in spreads on bank loans to small companies since 2009 Q4 (Table 1.B).  To help reduce the cost of bank borrowing for small companies, the Government launched the National Loan Guarantee Scheme in March to enable banks to lend to small businesses at a lower cost than would otherwise be the case. Household sector finances and the housing market Elevated bank funding costs have led to higher interest rates on mortgages.  The average interest rate on a new Bank Rate tracker mortgage with a 75% loan to value ratio rose by 0.5 percentage points between August 2011 and April 2012, Chart 1.11 New Bank Rate tracker mortgage rate,  Bank Rate and an estimate of banks’ marginal funding cost 0 2 4 6 8 10 2007 08 09 10 11 12 Five-year CDS premia Three-month Libor Bank Rate tracker mortgage rate Marginal funding cost(a) Bank Rate Per cent Sources:  Bank of England, British Bankers’ Association, Markit Group Limited and  Bank calculations.

The Credit Conditions Survey also pointed to increases in 2012 Q2 (Table 1.B).  Higher funding costs are most likely to affect the price of new lending, but mortgage rates have also increased  for some existing customers:  for example, some lenders  raised their standard variable rate for mortgages by up to 0.5 percentage points at the beginning of May.  Those changes affect around 10% of all outstanding mortgages. Elevated funding costs have not been associated with higher interest rates on unsecured household borrowing.  The cost of a £10,000 personal loan has fallen in recent months (Chart 1.13), and lenders responding to the Credit Conditions Survey did not expect any increase in spreads on unsecured loans in Q2 (Table 1.B).  Lenders reported that defaults on unsecured loans in Q1 had been lower than previously expected, which may have put downward pressure on unsecured loan rates. Growth in the stock of loans to individuals remained weak in 2012 Q1.  That reflected subdued growth in the stocks of both mortgage debt and unsecured loans (Chart 1.14).  Within unsecured loans, there was only modest growth in both credit card and other unsecured loans, which includes student loans. Despite the increases in mortgage rates, there has been a modest pickup in housing market activity since the autumn of 2011 (Chart 1.15).  That is likely, in part, to reflect some underlying strength in demand for housing.  For example, the Bank’s Agents reported that buy-to-let demand had picked up following earlier rises in rental yields and that initiatives to bolster demand for newly built properties have also supported activity.  On the supply side, the Agents’ contacts also reported that vendors had become more realistic about asking prices. The recent increase in housing market activity could also be related to the bringing forward of transactions ahead of the expiry on 24 March of the temporary stamp duty exemption for first-time buyers of properties up to £250,000.  The fall in mortgage approvals in February suggests that transactions may fall back somewhat after March because buyers will usually have arranged their mortgage well in advance of completing their transaction.  Previous experience suggests that changes in stamp duty rules can have a marked impact on transactions:   a spike at the end of 2009 can be attributed to the end of a temporary stamp duty exemption on purchases up to £175,000, although that exemption applied to all purchasers and not just to first-time buyers.   The Halifax and Nationwide house price indices fell by an average of 0.2% in the three months to April 2012.  These indices suggest that nominal house prices remain well below their pre-recession peaks and have been broadly flat over the past year, although they continued to fall in real terms.

(e) On mortgages with a loan to value ratio of 75%.  Real demand growth was weak during 2011 (Table 2.A). Over the year to Q4, GDP increased by only 0.5%.  The pattern of growth during the year was, however, volatile, owing to the effects of one-off factors, such as the additional bank holiday associated with the royal wedding in April. The weakness in real activity in 2011 was predominantly accounted for by domestic demand and, within that, household consumption (Section 2.1).  Subdued domestic demand growth is likely to have largely reflected domestic headwinds, such as falling household real incomes, tight credit conditions and the effects of the fiscal consolidation.  In addition, events in the euro area (Section 2.2) may have dampened domestic spending growth over the second half of the year, for example through their effect on business confidence. Subdued real GDP growth in 2011 was associated with an increase in nominal GDP of only 2.8% over the year to Q4 (Chart 2.1), well below its average growth rate in the decade before the 2008/09 recession.  Most of the rise in nominal spending over 2011 was accounted for by increases in the prices of goods and services, in part reflecting the rise in VAT at the start of that year. Output is provisionally estimated to have contracted by 0.2% in Q1 (Section 3).  Household and business spending growth is likely to have been subdued.  And export growth appears to have been dampened by continued weakness in euro-area activity. 2.1 Domestic demand Household spending Real household spending growth has been weak since late 2010, with consumption falling in each of the four quarters to 2011 Q3.  Although consumption is estimated to have risen modestly in Q4 (Table 2.A), the level of spending in that quarter stood only a little above its 2009 Q2 trough. GDP growth was muted during 2011.  Within that, household and business spending fell.  Net trade, however, made a positive contribution to growth, as exports grew modestly while imports fell, in part restrained by the weakness in domestic demand.  The pace of global growth slowed slightly in the second half of 2011.  UK output is provisionally estimated to have contracted by 0.2% in Q1. Domestic demand growth is likely to have been subdued and export growth appears to have been weighed down by continued weakness in euro-area demand. 2 Demand Section 2 Demand 17 8 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 2005 06 07 08 09 10 11 Real GDP Implied deﬂator Total (per cent) Percentage points + – (a) At market prices.

Household real post-tax income fell by around 1% between 2010 Q3 and 2011 Q4 (Chart 2.2), in part reflecting rises in VAT and in energy and import prices during that period. In addition to the squeeze in real incomes, households have faced other significant adverse shocks over the past four years. First, the 2008/09 recession is likely to have been associated with a marked reduction in future earnings prospects, perhaps prompting households to cut spending in order to smooth their consumption over time.  Second, households’ future earnings are likely to have become more uncertain as a result of the recession and, particularly for those in the public sector, the fiscal consolidation.  That may have led them temporarily to spend less, in order to build savings up as a precaution against any unanticipated weakness in future income.  And third, credit conditions have tightened, restricting the amount that households have been able to borrow. As part of the adjustment to these shocks, some households may want to reduce their debts relative to their income — a process sometimes referred to as deleveraging.  For example, some households may feel that their current debts leave them too vulnerable to future adverse events, given lower and more uncertain expected future incomes and tighter credit conditions than in the period before the 2008/09 recession. Households appear to have made some adjustment to these shocks.  The household saving ratio rose sharply during the 2008/09 recession and households have continued to save a greater proportion of their income since the end of the recession than immediately beforehand (Chart 2.3).  Once households have built up sufficient assets, then the saving ratio could fall back, boosting consumption growth for a period.  But some households may not have completed that adjustment yet, especially since falls in real incomes over the past two years will have made it harder to accumulate savings and to pay down debt.  Moreover, other factors — such as the need to make more provision for future retirement — may continue to raise household saving. Nonetheless, household spending growth should be supported throughout 2012 by some recovery in real income growth, as the drag from past rises in energy and import prices dissipates. But that pickup in real income growth, and therefore consumption growth, is likely to be more gradual than previously expected, given the somewhat higher near-term outlook for CPI inflation (Section 5). The latest indicators provide mixed evidence on household spending in Q1 but point, on balance, to muted growth.  Retail sales volumes, an indicator of household spending on goods, rose by 0.8% in Q1.  But the CBI Service Sector Survey suggests Chart 2.2 Household consumption and real income(a) 88 90 92 94 96 98 100 102 104 106 108 2003 05 07 09 11 Indices:  2006 = 100 Consumption(c) Real total post-tax income(d) Real post-tax   labour income(b) (a) Includes non-profit institutions serving households.

The recessions are assumed to end once output began to rise.  Section 2 Demand 19 that consumption of services fell, and measures of consumer confidence generally remain well below their historical averages. Dwellings investment Private sector dwellings investment plummeted during the 2008/09 recession.  Despite some recovery since then, in 2011 Q4 it stood around 35% below its pre-recession peak. The recent increase in housing market activity (Section 1) may, if it persists, be associated with a modest increase in dwellings investment — which includes spending on services associated with the sale and purchase of property.(1) Business spending Business investment fell sharply during the 2008/09 recession and continued to decline during the initial phase of the recovery.  Companies are likely to have reduced investment as the outlook for demand became weaker and more uncertain, and as credit conditions tightened.  Although business investment recovered over the year to 2011 Q3, it is estimated to have fallen by 3.3% in Q4, taking it back to around the same level as at the end of the recession. The subdued path of business investment relative to GDP since the end of the 2008/09 recession looks broadly similar to its path following the recessions of 1980/81 and 1990/91 (Chart 2.4).  On average, the ratio of real business investment to GDP has risen over time, as a gradual decline in the relative price of capital goods has encouraged companies to use more capital-intensive methods of production.  But the ratio fell during the recessions of 1980/81, 1990/91 and 2008/09 and declined somewhat further after the recessions had ended — particularly in the case of the 1990s recession. The persistent weakness in business investment following the end of recessions may reflect the fact that reversing investment projects is often difficult and costly, making companies reluctant to invest before the recovery in demand has become entrenched.  Evidence from CBI surveys suggests that that does account for some of the weakness in investment following the 2008/09 recession:  the proportion of businesses reporting that uncertainty about demand was likely to inhibit investment was generally higher throughout 2010 and 2011 than on average in the decade before the recession, especially for companies in the consumer, business and professional services sectors (Table 2.B).  Businesses’ uncertainty about demand is likely to have been compounded by concerns about the outlook for the euro area and, in particular, the risk that the necessary adjustments in several member countries may result in a disorderly outcome and substantially weaker global demand (Section 2.2). 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1976 81 86 91 96 2001 06 11 First nine quarters of recoveries(c) Recessions(b) Business investment to GDP ratio  Per cent 0 (a) Ratio of the chained-volume measure of business investment to the chained-volume measure of GDP at market prices.

(1) The links between housing market activity and dwellings investment are discussed in more detail in the box on page 20 of the February 2012 Report.  20 Inflation Report  May 2012 Other factors are also likely to have influenced business investment since the end of the 2008/09 recession.  In particular, credit conditions facing larger businesses eased during 2010 and the first three quarters of 2011 (Section 1), which should have provided some support to investment.  But credit conditions have tightened somewhat in recent months. Business investment is likely to have picked up in Q1.  Much of the fall in Q4 was accounted for by investment in the electricity, gas and water sector, which tends to be volatile and so may have rebounded in Q1.  In addition, the proportion of companies reporting that demand uncertainty was likely to hold back investment fell (Table 2.B).  Survey indicators of investment intentions point, on average, to modest increases in capital spending over 2012 (Table 2.C).  The medium-term outlook for business investment is discussed in Section 5. Businesses’ spending on stocks reduced output growth in Q4 (Table 2.A):  although companies continued to increase their stock levels, they did so by less than in the previous quarter. When the rate at which companies build up stocks stabilises, the drag on GDP growth from stockbuilding will dissipate. Government spending A substantial fiscal consolidation is under way.  The MPC’s projections are conditioned on the fiscal plans set out in the 2012 Budget, supplemented by the composition of nominal government spending underlying the Office for Budget Responsibility’s (OBR’s) associated Economic and Fiscal Outlook.  The effects on demand of the new policy measures announced in the 2012 Budget were projected to be small and roughly offsetting. The fiscal deficit continued to narrow over the past year. Public sector net borrowing fell to 8.3% of nominal GDP in 2011/12 from a peak of 11.2% in 2009/10 (Chart 2.5).  The OBR’s latest projections suggest that the deficit will narrow further in the next few years, although the fall in 2012/13 is expected to be relatively modest (Chart 2.5). Although the fiscal consolidation is likely to result in continued weakness in nominal government consumption growth over the next few years, measured real government consumption growth may be less markedly weak, because of the way in which the volume of government spending is estimated.  The box on page 21 provides more details. 2.2 External demand and UK trade Global demand growth slowed in the second half of 2011. That mostly reflected a weakening in euro-area output growth, although the pace of four-quarter growth also appeared to slow in some emerging economies.  In contrast, US output growth remained reasonably robust.  Survey indicators suggest that global activity continued to expand at a moderate rate in Chart 2.5 Public sector net borrowing(a) 8 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 2005/06 07/08 09/10 11/12 13/14 15/16 Change in public sector net borrowing Public sector net borrowing Per cent of nominal GDP + – Sources:  Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) and ONS.

Section 2 Demand 21 Measuring real government consumption Nominal government consumption has grown far less rapidly over the past three years than it did in the decade before the recession.  But that slowing has been associated with a much smaller decline in the reported rate of growth of real government consumption (Chart A).  This box explains how the ONS measures real government consumption and what that implies for estimates of real GDP. Measuring real government consumption is not straightforward.  On the whole, the public sector provides services that are free at the point of delivery.  That means that there is no direct measure of the prices of those services that can be used to deflate nominal government consumption. Instead, real consumption must be estimated in one of three ways:  using an imputed indicator of the price;  using indicators of the volume of inputs;  or using an indicator of the volume of output. Around one quarter of real government consumption is measured by deflating nominal spending by an imputed price index.  For example, some components of central and local government procurement are deflated using specially constructed price indices based on producer prices, retail prices and other information.  For a further small proportion of government consumption, the volume of output is estimated using indicators of the volume of inputs.  For these components of government consumption, changes in nominal spending tend to be associated with contemporaneous changes in real consumption (Table 1). For around two thirds of real government consumption, which includes services such as health and education, the volume of spending is measured directly using indicators of output.  In the case of school education, the indicator of output — the number of pupils taught — is scaled by an adjustment factor based on past increases in the average point score of candidates sitting GCSE examinations, which is designed to capture changes in the quality of output. Where real government consumption is measured directly from indicators of the volume of output, changes in nominal consumption are generally associated with only a limited contemporaneous change in real consumption.  That is because the output indicators tend to change only slowly over time.  The growth rates of these components of real consumption therefore tend to be relatively smooth, with changes in nominal consumption largely reflected in changes in the implied price deflator.  Indeed, whereas annual growth in nominal consumption of these components is reported to have fallen to 2.1% in 2011 from 7.9% in 2008, real growth during that period fluctuated around its 1998–2007 average rate (Table 1). The fiscal consolidation will result in persistent weakness in nominal government consumption growth over the forecast period.  But it may be associated with considerably less change in estimated real government consumption growth, since the majority of government output is measured using direct volume indicators.  Any change in real government consumption will be reflected in real GDP, but it will have no implications for the outlook for inflation, which depends on the public sector’s use of resources rather than estimates of its real output. 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 1997 99 2001 03 05 07 09 11 Recessions(a) At current prices Chained-volume measure Percentage changes on a year earlier + – (a) Recessions are defined as in Chart 2.3.

The euro area Euro-area GDP contracted by 0.3% in Q4.  Output continued to fall in the periphery countries, but GDP also declined in many other member countries, including Germany.  The Markit euro-area composite Purchasing Managers’ Index, an indicator of activity, picked up between October 2011 and January 2012. But most of those gains have since been reversed (Chart 2.6). Based on its historical relationship with output growth, the index suggests that euro-area GDP fell modestly again in Q1. The weakness in euro-area demand growth reflects, in part, the challenges faced by several member countries as they seek to regain competitiveness and reduce indebtedness.  Substantial fiscal consolidations are under way in many member countries, especially those in the periphery.  In addition, the ECB’s Bank Lending Survey suggested that credit conditions tightened a little further in Q1 (Table 2.D), albeit by much less than in Q4: respondents attributed that to improved conditions in bank funding markets following the ECB’s three-year longer-term refinancing operations (Section 1).  Measures of consumer and business confidence remained well below their 1999–2007 averages in April (Table 2.D). The United States US GDP is estimated to have increased by 0.5% in Q1, following growth of 0.7% in Q4.  In both quarters, growth was largely accounted for by increases in household spending. The unemployment rate dropped further from its peak of 10% in October 2009, falling to 8.1% in April (Chart 2.7).  Until mid-2011, much of the decline in the unemployment rate reflected a fall in the proportion of the adult population working or seeking work.  But since July 2011, increased employment has also been a factor pushing down unemployment.  The unemployment rate remains well above its pre-recession level, however, and elevated unemployment, alongside other headwinds — including housing market weakness and prospective fiscal consolidation — may continue to weigh on growth. Emerging economies Growth in emerging economies has remained solid since the start of 2012, although the pace of four-quarter growth in many countries has slowed relative to rates seen at the start of 2011.  Demand growth is likely to have been restrained by some combination of weakness in external demand, especially from advanced economies, and past domestic policy actions taken to reduce inflationary pressures. UK trade UK exports rose by 0.8% in the year to 2011 Q4.

Chart 2.6 Survey measures of global output growth(a)  Section 2 Demand 23 services exports fell over the year.  The latest data show that goods export growth slowed to 0.5% in the three months to February from 4.1% in Q4.  But that pattern of growth may, in part, prove erratic:  trade data are prone to revision and surveys point to a different profile of growth over the past year (Chart 2.8). The increase in goods exports in 2011 and early 2012 was driven by continued growth in goods exports to non-EU countries.  In contrast, goods exports to the EU fell.  Exports to non-EU countries were supported by the strength of demand in those countries.  Reports from the Bank’s Agents indicate that UK businesses have been looking to increase trade with non-EU countries, which may continue to support export growth. UK imports fell by 1.2% in the year to Q4, much weaker than the average growth rate in the ten years prior to the 2008/09 recession.  The latest data indicate that goods imports fell by 2% in the three months to February.  That is likely, in part, to reflect the weakness in domestic activity weighing on demand for imports.  But there are also signs that the depreciation of sterling between mid-2007 and the end of 2008 has led to some switching of expenditure away from imports:  spending on imports relative to spending on domestically produced goods and services has been broadly flat since the start of 2007, whereas it rose in the decade prior to the depreciation (Chart 2.9). The current account remained in deficit in Q4 (Chart 2.10). That deficit, alongside other factors such as low national saving, indicates a need for the UK economy to rebalance away from domestic demand towards net exports.(1) The depreciation of sterling between mid-2007 and the end of 2008 should aid that process, by continuing to support UK net trade and the current account over the medium term. 70   80   90   100   110   120   130 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 1991 95 99 2003 07 11 Index:  1997 = 100 Import penetration(b)    (right-hand scale)  Relative import prices(c)   (left-hand scale, which   has been inverted)   Index:  1997 = 100 Sources:  ONS and Bank calculations.

Chart 2.8 UK goods exports and surveys of export orders  24 Inflation Report  May 2012 The recovery in output since the 2008/09 recession has been unusually weak, with activity broadly flat since the middle of 2010.  Output is estimated to have fallen slightly in both of the past two quarters (Section 3.1), implying that the UK economy is technically in recession.  Measured output growth in Q2 is likely to be depressed by the impact of the additional bank holiday associated with the Diamond Jubilee.  And quarterly growth rates during the second half of 2012 will probably be affected by the Olympic Games (see the box on pages 26–27). Despite the recent weakness in output growth, employment increased, as the pace of reduction in public sector employment slowed and private sector employment growth picked up (Section 3.2).  The unemployment rate edged down. But it remains elevated, suggesting a significant amount of slack in the labour market.  There also appears to be a modest margin of spare capacity within companies on average (Section 3.3).  But considerable uncertainty around the overall degree of slack remains. 3.1 Output The ONS estimated that output contracted by 0.2% in 2012 Q1, following a fall of 0.3% in 2011 Q4.  Output is presently estimated to have been broadly flat since mid-2010, and to have remained well below its 2008 peak (Chart 3.1). In Q1, all of the main sectors of the economy are estimated to have been weak.  The preliminary GDP estimate suggests that service sector activity, which accounts for around three quarters of UK output, grew by only 0.1%, having fallen by 0.1% in Q4.  That weakness in Q1 is somewhat at odds with indicators from business surveys of service sector activity (Chart 3.2), which suggested a greater pickup in growth in Q1.   In addition, an estimated 3% fall in construction output reduced reported GDP growth by 0.2 percentage points in Q1. 3 Output and supply Output is estimated to have contracted by 0.2% in 2012 Q1, following a fall of 0.3% in 2011 Q4. Construction output fell sharply in Q1 and manufacturing and service sector activity were broadly flat.  Despite the fall in output, employment rose and the unemployment rate edged down. Unemployment remains elevated, however, and there also appears to be a modest margin of spare capacity within companies.  There remains considerable uncertainty around the overall extent of spare capacity in the economy.

Section 3 Output and supply 25 Construction output data are volatile and are prone to substantial revision.  In particular, there was an unusually large fall of 12.9% in non seasonally adjusted construction output in January, with output estimated to have recovered somewhat in February.  Given the past experience of revisions, in constructing their preliminary estimate of Q1 GDP the ONS assumed a stronger growth rate for construction than that suggested by the monthly data available at the time.(1) In Q1, output of the production industries was estimated to have reduced overall growth by 0.1 percentage points, mainly reflecting the continuing decline in oil and gas extraction. Manufacturing output was flat in Q1, following a fall of 0.7% in Q4. Survey measures indicate that business confidence improved in Q1 (Chart 3.3), particularly in the manufacturing sector. That suggests some recovery in both manufacturing and services output growth in Q2.  And construction output may make a positive contribution to growth in Q2, given that it has already recovered somewhat from its fall in January.  But oil and gas extraction is likely to be adversely affected by disruptions at the Elgin oil field in the North Sea. As explained in the box on pages 26–27, quarterly growth in Q2 and the remainder of 2012 will be affected by the additional Diamond Jubilee bank holiday and the Olympic Games.  There is uncertainty around the precise size of these effects.  But the combination of these two events is expected to lower output growth by around ½ percentage point in Q2, boost it by a little more than that in Q3 and lower it slightly in Q4 as output returns to its underlying level.  Thus a fall in measured output in Q2 could still reflect an improvement in growth excluding those one-off factors. Section 5 discusses the medium-term growth outlook. 3.2  Labour demand and supply The weakness in output growth since mid-2010 has been accompanied by a period of broadly flat overall employment and an elevated unemployment rate.  But the amount of downward pressure that slack in the labour market exerts on wages will depend, in part, on the extent to which those not in employment are actively seeking work and have the required skills to fill vacancies. Labour demand Since the middle of 2010, private sector employment has risen by around 450,000, while public sector employment has fallen by around 350,000 (Chart 3.4).  Overall employment picked up in 2011 Q4, increasing by around 60,000.  And employment increased further in the three months to February.

The pattern of quarterly growth in 2012 is likely to be affected by the additional bank holiday for the Diamond Jubilee and by the Olympic Games.  It is important to look through these effects when judging the strength of demand and hence the outlook for inflation, as they do not reflect enduring changes in underlying activity. The impact of the Diamond Jubilee As part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, the late-May bank holiday has been moved to 4 June and an additional bank holiday granted for 5 June.  The ONS does not adjust its measures of output for non-recurring bank holidays, such as the additional Jubilee bank holiday, although it does adjust for normal recurrent changes in the number of working days in a period.(1) So, if no activity happened on the additional bank holiday, measured output in Q2 would be commensurately lower. The combined holiday may also encourage some people to take extended periods of holiday or some businesses to arrange extended closures during that period.  It is likely that some of the lost output will be made up at other times, but as the Diamond Jubilee falls in the last month of Q2, the extent to which that happens during that quarter may be limited. The additional bank holiday is therefore likely to reduce measured output in Q2, though it may boost it somewhat in Q3. There are two recent examples of additional bank holidays: those for the Golden Jubilee in June 2002 and the royal wedding in April 2011. Both services and manufacturing output fell during the month of the Golden Jubilee in 2002, but recovered over subsequent months (Chart A).  At the time, the ONS estimated that the additional bank holiday could have reduced quarterly growth in 2002 Q2 by as much as 0.7 percentage points and boosted growth in 2002 Q3 by a similar amount. The temporary fall in output associated with the royal wedding in 2011 was somewhat smaller (Chart A).  Smoothing through the monthly volatility suggests that the royal wedding bank holiday lowered quarterly output growth by around 0.4 percentage points in 2011 Q2.  Output growth in Q3 may consequently have been around 0.4 percentage points higher than it otherwise would have been.  But there were other factors, such as supply chain disruptions following the Tōhoku earthquake, that are also likely to have affected output growth during the period, so the overall impact of the additional bank holiday is uncertain.(2) To the extent that the larger impact of the Golden Jubilee reflected the bank holiday occurring in the last month of the quarter, the impact of the additional Diamond Jubilee bank holiday may be more like that of the Golden Jubilee and, therefore, larger than that of the royal wedding.  Overall, the MPC’s central judgement is that the Diamond Jubilee bank holiday is likely to lower measured output growth in Q2 by around ½ percentage point and correspondingly increase growth in Q3 by around the same amount.  But there are risks on both sides of that central judgement. The impact of the 2012 Olympic Games London will host the 2012 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games during the period 27 July to 9 September. Hosting the Olympic Games involves the production and purchase of various outputs that are directly measured.  The ONS is likely to apply international conventions in recording those outputs, as, for example, the Australian Bureau of Statistics did for measuring the output of the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.(3) That means that expenditure on goods and services related to hosting the Games will be recorded as output when that expenditure occurs. Although most of the expenditure associated with the Games has already occurred, there is likely to be considerable expenditure concentrated in the immediate run-up to and during the Games, which could boost measured output growth in the middle of 2012.  For example, the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (LOCOG), the body responsible for staging the Games, estimates that it is likely to spend around £2 billion in total, equivalent to around 0.5% of quarterly UK GDP.(4) And by March 2011, LOCOG had spent only around £500 million of that. 98  99  100  101  102  Jan.

Chart A Manufacturing and services GVA around the Golden Jubilee in June 2002 and the royal wedding in April 2011(a)  The Olympic Games may also have indirect effects on output in Q3.  For example, the level of tourism may be higher as a result, although it is not clear to what extent tourism associated with the Games will displace some tourism that would have otherwise occurred.  And transport disruption and a concentration of more people than normal taking holidays in Q3 could reduce the output of businesses, particularly in London.  So it is uncertain what the net impact of these types of effects will be. An alternative way of estimating the likely impact is to look at the effect of past Olympic Games.  For the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, the Reserve Bank of Australia estimated that the boost to GDP growth in the quarter of the Games was around ¾ percentage point.(5) A similar size and pattern of spending in the United Kingdom related to the Olympics would provide a boost of around 0.2 percentage points to UK GDP. The MPC’s central judgement is that growth is likely to be slightly higher in Q3 as a result of the Games, with that effect reversed in Q4 as output returns to its normal level. Conclusion There is likely to be a significant impact from special factors on reported quarterly GDP growth during 2012.  But there is considerable uncertainty around the precise magnitude and profile of that impact.  The MPC’s central judgement is that the ONS measure of growth is likely to be around ½ percentage point weaker than underlying growth excluding those factors in Q2, but could be stronger by a little more than that in Q3.  Growth will then also be a little weaker in Q4 as the ONS measure of output returns to its underlying level. Section 3 Output and supply 27 Public sector employment continued to fall in 2011 Q4 (Chart 3.4), though at a slightly slower rate than earlier in the year.  There remains uncertainty around the overall extent of the reduction in public sector employment that is consistent with the Government’s spending plans. Private sector employment rose in Q4, more than offsetting the fall in public sector employment.  The growth in private sector employment since the middle of 2010 (Chart 3.4) may have reflected some companies needing to increase employment just to meet current demand.  Alternatively, to the extent that it reflected some companies expanding employment in anticipation of a recovery in demand, it could imply a period of employment growing more slowly than output in the near term.   Within whole-economy employment, the proportion of employees working part-time has increased since the start of the 2008/09 recession.  Although the average hours worked by both part-time and full-time employees have recovered to around their long-run averages (Table 3.A), the increase in the share of part-time workers means that, across the economy as a whole, average hours worked remain a little below past averages.  And the number of people working part-time but reporting that they would prefer a full-time job has continued to increase since the start of the 2008/09 recession (Table 3.B).  That suggests that, before increasing the number of people employed, there may be scope for employers to increase the hours of existing staff further by moving some people from part-time to full-time positions.

Survey measures of employment intentions remained mixed in Q1 and point to broadly flat private sector employment in the near term (Chart 3.5). Labour supply and labour market tightness The unemployment rate decreased slightly to 8.3% in the three months to February (Chart 3.6).  But it remains around 3 percentage points higher than at the start of 2008.  That increase in unemployment — one indicator of the degree of slack in the labour market — is likely to have put some downward pressure on wages (Section 4). There are reasons, however, why there might be less downward pressure on wages than implied by the increase in unemployment alone.  For example, the long-term unemployed are typically less likely to find employment than the short-term unemployed (Chart 3.7) and hence are likely to place less downward pressure on wages.  That may be because people who are out of work for a long period miss opportunities to develop the skills to compete effectively for jobs.  The long-term unemployment rate has increased since the start of 2008, but by less than following the 1990s recession (Chart 3.6). In addition to the unemployed, other non-employed people who report that they are currently not searching for a job, such as students and those looking after a family or home, do sometimes move into employment.  So those groups also contribute to the pool of potential employees.  For example, students who say that they are not searching for a job move into employment at a similar rate to those who are long-term unemployed (Chart 3.7). A wider measure of overall labour market pressure can therefore be obtained by weighting together the different groups not presently in a job by their respective probabilities of moving into one — the ‘weighted non-employment rate’ (Chart 3.8).(1) This measure of labour market slack has increased significantly since the start of 2008, mainly due to increases in unemployment and the number of students not searching for a job. Business surveys of companies’ ability to find suitable employees provide alternative indicators of labour market slack.  These survey balances indicate a slight increase in recruitment difficulties since 2010 (Table 3.C), despite the rise in unemployment over that period, but most remain considerably below their long-run averages.  Overall, it is likely that a considerable amount of slack remains in the labour market.

Section 3 Output and supply 29 3.3 Productivity and companies’ spare capacity During the 2008/09 recession, measured labour productivity fell significantly and since then has remained substantially below where it would have been if pre-recession trends had continued (Chart 3.9).  Moreover, the data currently available on output and employment suggest that productivity fell back in Q1.  At face value, the large gap between the current level of productivity and a continuation of its pre-recession trend might suggest that there is a significant degree of spare capacity within companies.  But business surveys indicate that a relatively small proportion of firms are operating below normal capacity, with that proportion little changed in Q1 (Chart 3.10).   Although it is difficult to reconcile the message for overall spare capacity from the aggregate productivity data and the survey indicators, both suggest that there have been some differences between the manufacturing and service sectors. Manufacturing productivity is slightly closer to its pre-recession trend than productivity in the service sector (Chart 3.9) and business surveys suggest that manufacturers have much less spare capacity (Chart 3.10).  It is possible that these survey measures do not fully capture how much capacity companies could bring on stream were there sufficient demand.  But the broad divergence between manufacturing and service sector capacity pressures is also reflected in companies’ stated intentions to invest to expand capacity (Chart 3.11), suggesting that a greater proportion of manufacturing companies are running up against capacity constraints. It is possible that some of the weakness in productivity may be short-lived.  For example, some companies may have held on to staff because they expect activity to recover in the future and it is costly to cut back staff and then rehire later;  or companies may be having to work just as hard to compete for a lower level of overall demand.  Forbearance by banks and the low level of real wage growth (Section 4) may have helped such companies to hold on to labour.  When demand recovers, those companies can be expected to register a recovery in productivity.  Alternatively, if they decide that demand will remain weak, they may shed labour, again boosting productivity. Robust growth in private sector employment and evidence from business surveys of capacity pressures suggest, however, that such labour hoarding is unlikely to be responsible for all of the overall weakness in productivity.  There are several reasons why productivity growth could be weak for a more sustained period. First, the banking crisis and the associated tightening in credit conditions may have reduced the availability of working Chart 3.8 Contributions to the weighted non-employment rate(a) Non-student inactive  Student inactive  Long-term unemployed  Short-term unemployed  Weighted non-employment rate  0  2  4  6  8  10  12  1998  2001  04  07  10  Per cent  Sources:  ONS (including the Labour Force Survey) and Bank calculations.

It is also likely to have impeded the flow of finance towards new or dynamic companies with higher productivity.  To the extent that credit conditions remain tight, capital constraints may continue to restrict the growth in some businesses’ productive capacity. Second, investment in both fixed and intangible capital has also been low in recent years.  Moreover, company insolvencies have risen, albeit by less than following previous recessions, leading some capital to be scrapped.  The resulting weakness in capital stock growth is likely to have reduced the growth rate of potential labour productivity.  Until the rate of investment increases and capital stock growth recovers, labour productivity growth may be persistently weaker.  Third, the reduction in total hours worked since the start of the 2008/09 recession will have reduced the opportunities for people to acquire skills on the job, further reducing productivity growth. Overall, the MPC judges that the underlying rate of productivity growth is likely to have been significantly weaker than usual since the start of the 2008/09 recession, although there is considerable uncertainty about that rate.  It is, however, likely that, alongside substantial spare capacity within the labour market, the margin of spare capacity remaining within companies is greater than normal.  Section 5 discusses the prospects for productivity growth.

That fall was largely accounted for by the rise in the standard rate of VAT to 20% in January 2011 dropping out of the twelve-month comparison (Section 4.1).  The near-term outlook is higher than in the February Report, reflecting, in part, the impact of higher energy prices and indirect taxes as well as strength in recent outturns. The outlook for CPI inflation will reflect developments in imported costs, and so tradable goods and services prices (Section 4.2).  And it will also depend on domestic influences: labour costs;  companies’ pricing behaviour;  and inflation expectations (Section 4.3). 4.1 Consumer prices Recent developments in CPI inflation Inflation fell back from its recent peak of 5.2% in September 2011 to 3.5% in March 2012.(1) That fall in inflation can be partly accounted for by lower direct contributions from energy prices — initially as sharp rises in petrol prices in late 2010 and early 2011 dropped out of the twelve-month comparison, and more recently as some retail energy prices were cut by the major domestic energy companies in early 2012 (Chart 4.1). But most of the decline in inflation in Q1 reflects the  January 2011 increase in the standard rate of VAT to 20% falling out of the twelve-month comparison.  Bank staff estimate that around three quarters of that increase in VAT was passed into consumer prices by the end of 2011 Q1, adding about 1 percentage point to CPI inflation for a year before the impact fell out in 2012 Q1.  There remains, however, some uncertainty around the precise timing and magnitude of the effect of the VAT rise.   4 Costs and prices CPI inflation fell sharply in 2012 Q1, and stood at 3.5% in March.  That fall was largely accounted for by the impact of the January 2011 increase in VAT dropping out of the twelve-month comparison. The near-term outlook is somewhat higher than the MPC’s February projection, in part driven by news contained in the March Budget and a slightly higher contribution from energy prices.  Earnings growth was subdued in 2011 and declined further in Q1, but private sector unit labour cost growth has been close to past average rates.  The corporate profit share appears to have fallen to an unusually low level.  Indicators of inflation expectations remained mixed.

Goods tend to be more  import-intensive than services so, set against the relative stability of services price inflation, that could reflect increases in world trade prices, stemming largely from past commodity price rises.   Short-term inflation measures, which seek to isolate recent price changes from past changes that are still affecting the  twelve-month inflation rate, were still at or above rates consistent with the 2% target in March (see the box on  page 33).   The outlook for CPI inflation The near-term profile for inflation — shown in Chart 5.6 on page 41 — is somewhat higher than the MPC’s  February 2012 projection.  That is due, in part, to slightly higher-than-expected CPI outturns in Q1, as well as news about the outlook for some CPI components since the February Report.  For example, the ONS estimates that changes to excise duties, such as higher tobacco duties, and other indirect tax increases announced in the March Budget will raise inflation by around 0.2 percentage points during 2012.(1) Higher expected utility prices (Section 4.2) also raise the inflation profile a little from Q3 onwards.   The higher near-term inflation outlook also reflects other pipeline pricing pressures.  These include the impact of weaker productivity growth on companies’ unit labour costs  (Section 4.3) and past rises in commodity prices passing through to consumer prices more rapidly than previously expected (Section 4.2).  Overall, the speed and extent of any further fall in inflation will depend upon the rate at which external price pressures wane, and on the response of domestic wages and prices to the margin of spare capacity.   4.2 External influences on inflation Movements in key external prices — such as increases in energy prices — can affect inflation materially, both through direct effects on prices and through their impact on companies’ production costs.  Given the projected increases in utility prices later this year, the contribution of energy prices to CPI inflation is likely to be slightly higher than projected three months ago.  It is also possible that past increases in non-oil commodity prices are putting a little more upward pressure on inflation than previously anticipated.  This subsection considers recent developments in more detail.

Section 4 Costs and prices 33 Recent developments in monthly inflation rates The MPC targets the twelve-month rate of CPI inflation.  At times, that inflation rate can be heavily influenced by base effects — one-off changes in prices that occurred earlier in the twelve-month comparison period.  For example, the increase in the headline rate of VAT in January 2011 added to inflation throughout 2011 before dropping out during 2012 Q1  (Section 4.1).  There are still some significant base effects affecting twelve-month CPI inflation, and, as such, the headline inflation rate may not provide a timely guide to current inflationary pressures.  This box, therefore, looks at  shorter-term movements in CPI inflation and some of the issues around such measures.   The CPI and its components are not seasonally adjusted. Comparisons over a twelve-month period should be largely unaffected by price movements repeated at similar points each year — for example, January sales.  But shorter-term price movements will be affected by such seasonal factors.  So an assessment of short-term price trends requires judgements  about the size of seasonal pricing patterns.  That seasonal adjustment can be approached in different ways.  For  example, subcomponents of the CPI basket can be adjusted  for seasonal patterns before weighting those components together;  the ONS uses this method to seasonally adjust RPIY.(1) Alternatively, the headline index itself can be directly adjusted.    It is difficult, however, to control accurately for seasonal patterns in some components.  For example, seasonal patterns may vary from year to year, perhaps with changing holiday dates or sales periods.  In addition, changes in ONS collection methods and components of the CPI basket can alter  seasonal patterns over time.  As a result, monthly seasonally adjusted measures of CPI inflation may still be affected by seasonal variations that inject additional volatility into such measures.  The red swathe in Chart A presents a range of annualised monthly CPI inflation rates, excluding Bank staff’s central estimate for the impact of VAT and changes in duties, generated by seasonally adjusting at the headline, divisional or main grouping levels of the CPI basket.  These measures indicate that the monthly rate of consumer price inflation declined in March to rates broadly consistent with the  2% target.  But these measures are volatile.  Indeed, smoothing through month-to-month volatility — the lilac swathe in Chart A — suggests that the annualised short-term rate of consumer price inflation has increased somewhat over the past three months, and remains above the target rate of inflation (Chart A).  That pickup reflected higher three-month average rates of inflation in March 2012 than in  December 2011 across a number of subcomponents. Even if seasonal adjustment accurately captures repeated price movements, short-term measures of inflation are likely to remain difficult to interpret.  Indeed, even the smoothed measures in Chart A are volatile, perhaps because the prices of some components of the CPI basket change only infrequently. Moreover, these measures will also be buffeted by external price pressures.  Overall, measures of shorter-term inflation can provide an additional gauge of underlying inflationary pressures within the economy.  In March 2012, such measures pointed to  near-term inflation at or above the 2% target.

(a) The swathe contains a range of estimates based upon three different levels of aggregation. These are:  headline CPI, twelve main divisions and 39 main groups.  All estimates exclude  the estimated impact of changes in VAT and duties.  X-12 ARIMA is used to seasonally adjust these headline, division and group indices since 1996.  Division and group indices are  re-weighted into a headline index using weights in the consumer price basket.  In addition, alternative measures are obtained by only seasonally adjusting those divisional or group indices that are found to display seasonal variation before re-weighting.

The initial increase in oil prices was likely to have reflected developments in oil supply rather than positive news on global demand, as other commodity prices were largely unchanged over that period (Chart 4.3).  Indeed, there were some disruptions to actual oil production, such as those in South Sudan.  And there were also concerns about future oil supplies, in part due to political tensions in the Middle East — particularly the EU embargo on Iranian oil exports, which is likely to reduce overall market capacity.  The fallback in oil prices over recent weeks is likely to have reflected weaker global demand prospects together with some easing in those concerns over oil supply. Those demand and supply considerations will be reflected in the spot and futures prices of oil.  In the fifteen days running up to the May Report, the spot price and futures curve, in sterling terms, were broadly back to their levels at the time of the February Report (Chart 4.4), suggesting a small decline in the price of oil over the next couple of years.  But there are risks around that profile.  An intensification of concerns about future oil supply could raise oil prices.  But they could fall further if world demand prospects weaken.  Movements in the prices of option contracts suggest that the relative weight that market participants attach to a rise in oil prices has fallen in recent weeks (Chart 4.5).    Gas futures prices are slightly higher over the near term than they were three months ago (Chart 4.4).  That may eventually feed into retail gas and electricity prices.  The conditioning assumption underlying the MPC’s central projection is now that the major domestic energy suppliers raise domestic energy prices slightly in the autumn, although there is significant uncertainty around that assumption.  Even if utility prices do rise modestly, the overall contribution of retail energy prices to inflation is likely to fall as larger increases in energy prices in late 2011 drop out of the twelve-month comparison.   Non-energy import prices As discussed in previous Reports, higher prices of non-energy imported goods and services have boosted CPI inflation over the past few years.  Initially that reflected the impact of the 25% depreciation of sterling that occurred in the early stages of the financial crisis (Section 1).  But over 2011, elevated import price inflation largely reflected strength in world export prices (Chart 4.6), which, in turn, reflected rapid commodity price rises in late 2010 and early 2011 (Chart 4.7). Following those increases in commodity prices, increases in the prices of imported goods and services are likely to have raised companies’ production costs and subsequently added to CPI inflation over the recent past.  The recent pickup in goods price inflation relative to services price inflation (Section 4.1) is Chart 4.5 Oil price option-implied asymmetry(a) 2010 11 12 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 Difference from average since 2010 February Report – + Sources:  Bloomberg, New York Mercantile Exchange and Bank calculations.

Chart 4.4 Sterling oil and wholesale gas prices  Section 4 Costs and prices 35 consistent with that, as goods tend to be more  import-intensive than services.  In addition, the pickup in goods price inflation may also reflect domestic producers of goods that compete with imports taking the opportunity to raise their prices.   Further ahead, unless commodity prices rise further, the upward pressure on inflation from traded goods and services prices should moderate.  Indeed, import price inflation has recently fallen back, as world export price inflation has declined (Chart 4.6).  Moreover, non-oil commodity prices have fallen back recently and remain well below early-2011 levels (Chart 4.3).  The recent appreciation of sterling  (Section 1) should also bear down on imported costs a little.  4.3 Domestic influences on inflation The pace at which inflation falls back will depend not only on external pressures, but also on domestic influences, such as the degree to which spare capacity weighs on labour costs, and companies’ pricing decisions.  Earnings growth has continued to be weak but, given subdued productivity growth, companies’ labour cost growth per unit of output has been more resilient.  Companies’ profit margins appear to be at a lower level than normal, and companies may try to restore them over 2012, though that need not happen through higher prices.  The pricing environment, including household and companies’ inflation expectations, will also influence companies’ pricing decisions.   Labour costs Private sector average weekly earnings (AWE) data provide a timely indicator of companies’ labour costs and can also shed light on growth across different components of earnings. Private sector AWE growth weakened during the second half of 2011 and declined further in early 2012, largely reflecting weakness in bonuses (Table 4.A).  But the significant negative contribution from bonuses, particularly in the financial sector, probably contains little information about future earnings growth or companies’ costs. Wage growth excluding bonuses, known as regular pay growth, has also been weak and declined into Q1.  Within that, private sector settlements have picked up gradually since 2010 Q1: the mean settlement recorded over the three months to March was 2.6% compared with the recent trough of 1.4% in the three months to February 2010 (Chart 4.8).  But some of that recent increase was driven by multi-year settlements agreed in previous years.  Excluding multi-year deals, settlements have weakened slightly into 2012 and are running at a similar rate to those made a year ago.(1) Overall, settlements remain substantially below the rates seen prior to the 2008/09 (1) Multi-year settlements are described in more detail on page 36 of the May 2011 Report.

The latest observation is 2011 Q4.  36 Inflation Report  May 2012 recession, probably reflecting the considerable degree of slack in the labour market, as well as only modest productivity growth (Section 3).    The decline in regular pay growth in Q1 largely reflects a smaller contribution from regular pay drift — the difference between regular pay growth and pay settlements.  Movements in drift tend to reflect changes in earnings related to working patterns, such as overtime, as well as merit pay increases that could be associated with productivity improvements.  As such, movements in this component tend to be related to movements in productivity and average hours worked  (Chart 4.9).    Companies’ costs depend not only on the wages of their employees but also on how productive those employees are. Although wage growth has been weak, that has been accompanied by weak productivity growth over recent years (Section 3).  As well as measures of wages themselves, it is therefore also useful to look at unit labour costs — companies’ total labour costs per unit of output produced.  An AWE-based measure of four-quarter private sector unit labour cost  growth remained close to past average rates in 2011, with weaker-than-usual earnings growth continuing to be offset by little or no productivity growth (Chart 4.10).  The outlook for labour costs depends both on the extent to which slack within the labour market places downward pressure on earnings, and on the evolution of productivity (Section 5).   Companies’ pricing decisions Companies’ pricing decisions relative to their costs also matter for the inflation outlook.  In part those decisions will depend on the current level of companies’ mark-ups over costs.  It is difficult to ascertain, in aggregate, companies’ mark-ups precisely, but the latest National Accounts estimate of the corporate profit share was significantly below its pre-2008/09 recession average in Q4 (Chart 4.11), suggesting that margins are compressed.  That will, in part, reflect the increases in costs faced by many companies in recent years.  But it could also reflect the significant slack in the economy, which might have encouraged companies to keep prices relatively low to bolster demand. Within that aggregate measure, different businesses’ profits will have developed in different ways.  For example, evidence from Supply and Use tables up to 2009 suggests that the depreciation of sterling between mid-2007 and the end of 2008 boosted exporters’ profits.  At the same time, profit margins for consumer-facing companies — most directly relevant for consumer prices — declined.(1) And more recent cost and price trends suggest that profit margins for consumer-facing companies remain further below long-run averages than aggregate profit margins.

Section 4 Costs and prices 37 That evidence of compressed profit margins suggests that there could be some upward pressure on inflation if  consumer-facing companies raise prices in order to try to restore their profitability.  Alternatively, a recovery in profit margins could occur through a period of weak cost growth with little upward pressure on domestic prices.  Or it could take place through a reallocation of resources towards the export sector:  some domestic-facing companies with relatively low productivity and narrow margins may shift supply towards foreign markets or may go out of business.   Inflation expectations Whether households seek higher wages or companies try to raise prices will depend, in part, on their expectations of future inflation:  for example, if companies expect inflation to remain elevated, they may be more likely to raise their own prices. Over the recent past, movements in longer-term inflation expectations have been mixed:  several measures have edged up, but most measures remain relatively close to their series averages. Movements in survey measures of inflation expected in a year’s time have also been mixed.  As CPI inflation declined  in 2011 Q4 and 2012 Q1, such survey measures of inflation declined (Chart 4.12).  But, more recently, the YouGov/Citigroup survey of households’ expectations and the Bank’s survey of professional forecasters ticked up.  Higher expectations of inflation in the near term could be associated with greater persistence in inflation if companies raise their prices more rapidly as a result, or if it enables households to bid for higher wages.  That said, in the latest Bank/NOP survey fewer than 10% of households said they would expect higher pay in light of higher inflation expectations.

Chart 4.12 Inﬂation expectations for a year ahead  38 Inflation Report  May 2012 5 Prospects for inflation 5.1 The projections for demand and inflation Since the February Report, output is estimated to have fallen a little again and the near-term inflation outlook appears somewhat higher.  But these developments do not fundamentally change the nature of the challenges facing the MPC following the financial crisis and subsequent recession. Those challenges make it particularly difficult to predict the path of output and inflation over the next few years with any precision.  The Committee’s discussions and decisions are based on the broad shape of the economic outlook rather than precise numerical projections.  Output remains some 4% below its pre-crisis peak.  The sluggishness of output growth in the aftermath of the financial crisis reflects the headwinds from weak real income growth, global developments, and the process of balance sheet repair under way in the public and private — particularly the financial — sectors.  Anaemic output growth has been associated with a period of exceptionally weak productivity growth.   Chart 5.1 shows the outlook for four-quarter real GDP growth conditioned on the assumptions that Bank Rate follows a path implied by market interest rates and that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remains at £325 billion throughout the forecast period.  Output will be reduced by the loss of a working day at the time of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in June, and possibly buoyed by the impact of the Olympics in Q3.  Four-quarter GDP growth is projected to increase gradually as households’ Inflation has fallen back substantially since last autumn.  It is, however, still well above the  2% target, and is likely to remain elevated over the coming year.  But inflation is projected to fall back further, as the current boost from external price pressures wanes.  Output has barely grown since the middle of 2010, and is estimated to have contracted slightly in each of the past two quarters.  Four-quarter growth should recover gradually from the middle of this year as a pickup in households’ real income growth supports consumer spending.  Although the expansionary stance of monetary policy should continue to support demand, headwinds from the external environment, tight credit conditions and the fiscal consolidation are likely to persist.  Reflecting those headwinds, a margin of economic slack is likely to continue to bear down on inflation over the forecast period. Under the assumptions that Bank Rate moves in line with market interest rates and the stock of purchased assets remains at £325 billion, inflation is judged about as likely to be below the target as above it by the end of the forecast period. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 2008 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 Percentage increases in output on a year earlier Projection Bank estimates of past growth ONS data + – The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for GDP growth.  It has been conditioned on the assumption that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remains at £325 billion throughout the forecast period.  To the left of the first vertical dashed line, the distribution reflects the likelihood of revisions to the data over the past;  to the right, it reflects uncertainty over the evolution of GDP growth in the future.  If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that the mature estimate of GDP growth would lie within the darkest central band on only 10 of those occasions.  The fan chart is constructed so that outturns are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter green areas on 10 occasions.  In any particular quarter of the forecast period, GDP growth is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fan on 90 out of 100 occasions.  And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions GDP growth can fall anywhere outside the green area of the fan chart.  Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey background.  In any quarter of the forecast period, the probability mass in each pair of identically coloured bands sums to 10%.  The distribution of that 10% between the bands below and above the central projection varies according to the skew at each quarter, with the distribution given by the ratio of the width of the bands below the central projection to the bands above it.  In Chart 5.1, the probabilities in the lower bands are the same as those in the upper bands at Years 1, 2 and 3.  See the box on page 39 of the November 2007 Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.  The second dashed line is drawn at the two-year point of the projection. Chart 5.1 GDP projection based on market interest rate expectations and £325 billion asset purchases  Section 5 Prospects for inflation 39 real income growth picks up, supporting a revival in consumer spending.    Developments abroad, particularly in the euro area, will continue to be a major influence on the UK economy.  The projections assume that euro-area policymakers ensure that the twin challenges facing the periphery countries of regaining competitiveness and reducing indebtedness are tackled in an orderly fashion.  Even so, growth in the euro area is likely to pick up only modestly, and to remain below pre-crisis average rates for some time.  There are substantial uncertainties around that projection given the scale of the adjustments that are necessary.  Moreover, despite recent policy initiatives, there is still a possibility that this process could involve a disorderly adjustment, resulting in sharply lower output in the euro area.  As was the case in past Reports, the MPC sees no meaningful way to quantify the size and likelihood of the most extreme possibilities associated with developments in the  euro area and they are therefore excluded from the fan charts. Concerns about the possibility of a disorderly resolution have, however, already adversely influenced asset prices, bank funding costs and confidence and as a consequence affect the MPC’s projections.  Indeed, the MPC judges it likely that the possibility of such extreme outcomes crystallising will continue to weigh on UK activity for some time, even if those outcomes do not actually occur.   The outlook for growth also depends on:  the outlook for productivity growth and its impact on household and corporate incomes;  how rapidly consumption responds to the recovery in income;  credit conditions;  and the impacts of the fiscal consolidation and the MPC’s asset purchases.  There remains a range of views among Committee members about the likely effects of those factors on GDP.  Based on the conditioning assumptions described above, the Committee’s best collective judgement is that four-quarter GDP growth is likely to pick up gradually, with growth still a little more likely to be below its historical average than above it two years into the forecast period, but with those risks roughly equal at the end of the three-year forecast period (Chart 5.2).  The distribution for growth in the near term is somewhat lower than projected three months ago, reflecting the impacts of a higher near-term outlook for inflation on  real incomes and the higher level of sterling on net trade (Chart 5.4).  Further out in the forecast period the profile is lower due to a slower pickup in productivity growth and the implications that this is likely to have for household and business spending (Chart 5.5).  Given the subdued outlook for growth, output is not likely to surpass its pre-crisis level before 2014 (Chart 5.3) — some six years after the start of the recession.  That weak outlook reflects, in part, continued weakness in the growth of productivity and labour supply, and therefore the economy’s 0 20 40 60 80 100 <1.75 1.75–2.75 2.75–3.75 >3.75 2014 Q2 2015 Q2 Probability, per cent   GDP growth (percentage increase in output on a year earlier) (a) These figures are derived from the same distribution as Chart 5.1.

See the footnote to Chart 5.1 for details of the assumptions underlying the projection for GDP growth.  The width of this fan over the past has been calibrated to be consistent with the four-quarter growth fan chart, under the assumption that revisions to quarterly growth are independent of the revisions to previous quarters.  Over the forecast, the mean and modal paths for the level of GDP are consistent with Chart 5.1.  So the skews for the level fan chart have been constructed from the skews in the four-quarter growth fan chart at the one, two and three-year horizons.  This calibration also takes account of the likely path dependency of the economy, where, for example, it is judged that shocks to GDP growth in one quarter will continue to have some effect on GDP growth in successive quarters.  This assumption of path dependency serves to widen the fan chart.

If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that GDP growth in 2013 Q2 and 2014 Q2 would lie somewhere within the range covered by the histogram on 90 occasions.

In the period leading up to the MPC’s May decision, the path implied by forward market interest rates was for Bank Rate to remain at 0.5% until 2013 Q1 and to rise gradually thereafter.  The path for Bank Rate at the time of the May Report was, on average, 0.1 percentage points higher than that assumed in the February Report.  The May projections are conditioned on an assumption that the total stock of asset purchases financed by the creation of central bank reserves remains at £325 billion throughout the forecast period, the same total scale of purchases assumed in the February projections. The starting point for sterling’s effective exchange rate index (ERI) in the MPC’s projections was 83.3, the average for the fifteen working days to 9 May.  That was 2.8% above the starting point for the February projections.  Under the MPC’s usual convention,(1) the exchange rate is assumed to remain broadly flat, and is higher throughout the forecast period than assumed in February. The starting point for UK equity prices in the MPC’s projections was 2970 — the average of the FTSE All-Share for the fifteen working days to 9 May.  That was 0.5% below the starting point for the February projection. Energy prices are assumed to evolve broadly in line with the paths implied by futures markets over the forecast period. Average Brent oil futures prices for the next three years were around 4% higher (in US dollar terms) than at the time of the February Report.  Wholesale gas futures prices were slightly higher over the forecast period than at the time of the February Report.  The outlook for energy prices is uncertain, but the central projection is conditioned on a benchmark assumption of increases in domestic gas and electricity prices averaging 2.5% in the second half of 2012.

Section 5 Prospects for inflation 41 supply capacity.  That said, the Committee judges that there is presently a sizable margin of spare capacity, largely concentrated in the labour market.  This should diminish over the forecast period, although it is unlikely to disappear completely. Inflation has continued to fall back from its recent peak of 5.2% in September 2011.  But it remains well above the  2% target.  Chart 5.6 shows the outlook for CPI inflation, on the same conditioning assumptions.  In the near term, inflation is likely to remain well above the target, a somewhat higher profile than thought likely three months ago (Chart 5.7).  That change reflects, in part, the impact of higher energy prices and indirect taxes.  But it also reflects other pipeline pricing pressures, including the impact of weaker productivity on companies’ unit labour costs and past rises in commodity prices passing through to consumer prices more rapidly than previously expected.  Inflation is expected to decline towards the end of this year as the utility price rises in Autumn 2011 drop out of the twelve-month comparison, the impact of past rises in commodity prices wanes, and the higher level of sterling reduces inflationary pressures a touch.   The outlook for inflation depends on a number of major influences.  There may be further shocks to energy and other commodity prices.  Companies’ domestic costs will be influenced by spare capacity.  And the outlook also depends upon the extent to which, and how quickly, slower growth in costs is reflected in inflation.  The precise impact of these influences is difficult to predict.  Given the degree of uncertainty, the MPC places more weight on the broad shape of the distribution than its exact calibration.

Chart 5.6 is conditioned on the assumption that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remains at £325 billion throughout the forecast period.  Chart 5.7 was conditioned on the assumption that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves reached £325 billion and remained there throughout the forecast period.  If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that inflation in any particular quarter would lie within the darkest central band on only 10 of those occasions.  The fan charts are constructed so that outturns of inflation are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter red areas on 10 occasions.  In any particular quarter of the forecast period, inflation is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fans on 90 out of 100 occasions.  And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions inflation can fall anywhere outside the red area of the fan chart.  Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey background.  In any quarter of the forecast period, the probability mass in each pair of identically coloured bands sums to 10%.  The distribution of that 10% between the bands below and above the central projection varies according to the skew at each quarter, with the distribution given by the ratio of the width of the bands below the central projection to the bands above it.  In Chart 5.6, the probabilities in the upper bands are the same as those in the lower bands at Year 1 but they are slightly larger at Years 2 and 3.  In Chart 5.7, the probabilities in the lower bands are the same as those in the upper bands at Years 1, 2 and 3.  See the box on pages 48–49 of the May 2002 Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.  The dashed lines are drawn at the respective two-year points.  42 Inflation Report  May 2012 forecast period, the Committee judges it likely that inflation will fall back, possibly to a little below target, with the risks to that outlook skewed slightly to the upside.  By the end of the forecast period, there is roughly a one-in-four chance that inflation will be within half a percentage point of the target (Chart 5.8) but, within that central range, the MPC finds it difficult to attach relative probabilities to different outcomes with confidence.   Overall, the Committee’s best collective judgement is that, by the end of the forecast period, the risks of inflation being above or below the target are broadly balanced (Chart 5.9). Although the near-term news on inflation means that the distribution is a little higher than in the February Report in 2013 Q2 (Chart 5.10), by 2014 Q2 the distribution is similar to that in February, with the downward revision to demand associated with a weaker outlook for supply (Chart 5.11).    5.2 Key judgements and risks How will developments in the rest of the world affect UK activity? Developments elsewhere in the world will be a key influence on UK output.  UK export growth is likely to strengthen gradually over the forecast period as global growth picks up. There is considerable uncertainty around the strength of the recovery in the United States, as well as the drivers of slowing growth in emerging economies since early 2011 (Section 2). Consequently the support to UK growth from these regions is uncertain.  But the biggest risks stem from developments in the euro area — the United Kingdom’s most important trading partner.   Several euro-area countries face significant challenges in regaining competitiveness and reducing indebtedness.  In part reflecting that, euro-area output fell at the end of 2011 and business surveys pointed to a further fall in 2012 Q1.  A prolonged period of adjustment in the most vulnerable countries is likely to continue to weigh on growth over the forecast period.  Overall euro-area output growth is judged likely to pick up only modestly, to below pre-crisis average rates.  Even assuming that the adjustment within the euro area proceeds in an orderly manner, there are substantial uncertainties around the outlook for activity there, and hence also UK exports.      Moreover, despite recent policy initiatives, there is still a possibility that this process could involve a disorderly outcome, resulting in considerably lower output in the  euro area, and significant disruption to global banking and financial markets.  As was the case in past Reports, the MPC sees no meaningful way to quantify the size and likelihood of the most extreme outcomes associated with developments in the euro area and they are therefore excluded from the  fan charts.  But concerns about the possibility of a disorderly 0 20 40 60 80 100 2012 Q2  13 14 15 Q3  Q1  Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1  Q2 Q3 Q4  Q1  Q2  Q4  Per cent February Inﬂation Report  May Inﬂation Report  The May and February swathes in this chart are derived from the same distributions as Charts 5.6 and 5.7 respectively.  They indicate the assessed probability of inflation being above target in each quarter of the forecast period.  The 5 percentage points width of the swathes reflects the fact that there is uncertainty about the precise probability in any given quarter, but they should not be interpreted as confidence intervals.  The dashed line is drawn at the two-year point of the May projection.  The two-year point of the February projection was one quarter earlier.

Chart 5.8 Frequency distribution of CPI inflation based on market interest rate expectations and £325 billion asset purchases(a)  Section 5 Prospects for inflation 43 adjustment continue to be reflected in financial market prices and in household and business confidence, both in the  euro area and elsewhere, and so inevitably affect spending and the MPC’s projections.  Indeed, the MPC judges that the threat of such extreme outcomes is likely to continue to affect asset prices, including the exchange rate, confidence and hence  UK activity for some time to come, even on the assumption that the most extreme events do not materialise. In particular, UK bank funding costs, and hence credit conditions, are likely to depend, in part, on euro-area prospects.  Heightened euro-area concerns contributed to higher UK bank funding costs in the second half of 2011. Although the ECB’s longer-term refinancing operations were associated with an initial improvement in funding conditions, some indicators of unsecured funding costs have since  picked up again (Section 1).  The MPC judges that funding costs are likely to fall back only gradually, reflecting the continued threat of adverse developments in the euro area.  That implies that the cost of credit for UK households and businesses is likely to remain elevated relative to risk-free rates throughout the forecast period.  There is, however, a considerable degree of uncertainty around that judgement.  Continued uncertainty about the euro area could, more generally, weigh on domestic spending.  If businesses remain concerned about the prospects for demand from the euro area for their exports, or the impact on domestic demand of continued tight credit conditions, that may deter them from making major spending decisions.  Business and housing investment are likely to pick up over the forecast period as demand recovers.  But the extent of the recovery will depend crucially on the extent to which the drags from tight credit conditions and heightened uncertainty ease.   0  1  2  3  4  2.0  1.0  0.0  1.0  2.0  3.0  4.0  5.0  – + Probability density, per cent(b) May February Chart 5.10 Projected probabilities of CPI inflation outturns in 2013 Q2 (central 90% of the distribution)(a) 0 1 2 3 4 2.0  1.0  0.0  1.0  2.0  3.0  4.0  5.0  – + Probability density, per cent(b) May February Chart 5.11 Projected probabilities of CPI inflation outturns in 2014 Q2 (central 90% of the distribution)(a) (a) Charts 5.10 and 5.11 represent cross-sections of the CPI inflation fan chart in 2013 Q2 and 2014 Q2 for the market interest rate projection.

(b) Average probability within each band;  the figures on the y-axis indicate the probability of inflation being within ±0.05 percentage points of any given inflation rate, specified to one decimal place.

Household consumption is only a little higher than its  2009 Q2 trough.  That partly reflects the squeeze on real incomes from significant rises in import and energy prices and VAT.  But households have also saved a greater fraction of their incomes than in the years immediately prior to the recession, prompted by heightened uncertainty, diminished income expectations and tighter credit conditions (Section 2).    As the factors squeezing real income growth ease, the drag on consumption growth should moderate, though at a somewhat slower pace than assumed in the February Report, given the higher near-term inflation outlook.  But the outlook for consumption will also depend on how much of their income households save.  If the recent period of higher saving has left households’ precautionary holdings of assets close to desired levels, then they may save a smaller proportion of their income in the future.  That would support consumption growth.  But acting in the other direction, the sustained period of weak income growth may mean that some households have not yet adjusted their balance sheets as much as they would like, and others may need to save more for future retirement provision. Their consumption may therefore grow more slowly than their income for a period, as they increase the rate at which they repay debt or accumulate financial assets.   The process of adjustment in the household sector is judged likely to continue over the forecast period, so that the household saving rate remains around current levels.  As household income growth recovers, consumption growth is therefore likely to rise gradually, to a little below its historical average rate.  But there are substantial risks around those judgements.   How will productivity evolve? The outlook for both GDP and inflation depends significantly on the evolution of the economy’s supply potential.  Supply appears to have grown unusually weakly since the onset of the financial crisis.  Low levels of investment have been reflected in slow growth in the capital stock.  The rise in long-term unemployment means that the proportion of the workforce that is able to compete effectively for jobs has probably declined.  And, most importantly, persistently sluggish measured productivity growth suggests that underlying productivity has grown weakly. The Committee’s central judgement is that underlying productivity growth is likely to pick up gradually over the second half of the forecast period to a little below its historical average rate.  That outlook is, however, highly uncertain, particularly because it is unclear why productivity growth has been so subdued in the recent past (Section 3).  It is possible that the past weakness in productivity growth in part reflected the impact of tighter credit conditions and heightened uncertainty.  Those factors could, for example, have  Section 5 Prospects for inflation 45 constrained the rate at which companies have been implementing new ideas, and they may continue to constrain both demand and supply over the forecast period.  In addition, underlying productivity growth could depend upon the pace of demand growth:  if demand recovers, that could spur a stronger recovery in productivity, but persistent weakness in demand growth could continue to retard productivity growth. Even if productivity growth remains weak during the forecast period, that does not imply that it will be permanently weaker. Indeed some of the lost ground could well be recovered beyond that horizon.  For example, it is possible that there is a growing stock of innovative ideas that would be exploited in a more conducive financial environment. How quickly will companies’ domestic costs grow? The degree of slack in the labour market appears to have increased significantly since the beginning of 2008.  That is likely to be a reason why nominal wages have been growing at below-average rates over the past few years.  Over the forecast period, the Committee judges that labour market slack is likely to diminish somewhat.  That reflects some increase in employment later in the forecast period, as activity picks up. But it also reflects slower growth in labour supply as the ability of some of those without jobs to compete for work erodes or they quit the labour market completely.  So although slack is likely to weigh on wage growth throughout the forecast period, that drag may decline a little towards the end.   Companies’ labour costs, however, depend on the evolution of productivity as well as earnings.  Over the recent past, weak productivity growth has offset the downward impact of labour market slack on unit labour costs, so that those costs have grown at close to their historical average rate (Section 4).  But over the forecast period, it is likely that some recovery in productivity growth will put downward pressure on unit labour cost growth, even as wage growth picks up. Overall, therefore, companies’ unit labour cost growth is judged likely to fall back and remain well below its historical average rate for much of the forecast period.  There are considerable risks around that outlook.  On the upside, it may be that less of the past weakness in nominal wage growth reflects the restraining effect of slack and more of it reflects the impact of subdued productivity.  In that case, wages and costs might rise somewhat faster as productivity growth  picks up.  But on the downside, if more labour market slack builds up — for example, if fewer people lose touch with the labour market — that may exert a greater downward influence on companies’ costs.  Will there be further increases in the prices of traded goods and services? Companies’ external costs have risen sharply in recent years. The marked fall in the sterling exchange rate between  mid-2007 and the end of 2008 has, over time, been reflected  46 Inflation Report  May 2012 in higher prices for a wide range of traded goods and services. And costs have also been pushed up by increases in global commodity prices — most importantly the cost of energy. In marked contrast to the experience of substantial price rises over the past few years, the MPC’s projections incorporate little further increase in the prices of imported goods and services over the forecast period.  That is in large part because those projections are conditioned on a downward-sloping oil futures curve and broadly flat futures prices for other commodities, on average.  But such assumptions may well be confounded, and the risks around that outlook probably lie to the upside.  Further adverse news about oil supply — for example, relating to heightened tensions in the Middle East — over and above that already captured in current spot and futures prices, could lead to sharp rises in prices.  And, although any unexpected slowing in world growth could be associated with weaker commodity price pressures, the composition of global growth will also matter, with prices closely linked to activity in emerging economies where output growth is particularly commodity-intensive.  How much and how quickly will margins be restored? Although the outlook for costs appears subdued, the path of inflation over the forecast period will depend significantly on whether companies, especially those in the consumer-facing sector, need to restore their profit margins and, if so, how  they do that.  Timely and accurate indicators of aggregate margins do not exist.  A measure based on National Accounts data, though imperfect, suggests that profits were unusually low as a share of GDP at the end of 2011 (Section 4).  And, given that the fall in sterling in 2007 and 2008 has probably bolstered exporting companies’ margins relative to those in other sectors, consumer-facing companies’ profit margins  have probably been substantially squeezed.  That could reflect both the rises in costs in recent years and a desire to keep prices low in the face of weak demand and plentiful spare capacity.   There is considerable uncertainty about the likelihood and nature of a restoration of consumer-facing companies’ profit margins.  The MPC’s central judgement is that these margins are likely to increase somewhat by the end of the forecast period, as prices rise more quickly than costs, resulting in some upward pressure on inflation.  Consumer sector margins could, however, be restored primarily through a period of weak labour cost growth in that sector rather than higher inflation. Or the process of rebalancing towards the export sector that is under way could be associated with a longer period of high export sector margins and low consumer sector margins. Alternatively, it is possible that the recent period of  above-target inflation will enable businesses to raise their prices more easily, or that spare capacity will have less restraining influence on margins.   Section 5 Prospects for inflation 47 5.3 Summary and the policy decision Inflation has fallen from its peak in late 2011.  It is likely to remain above the 2% target over the next year or so but, as the effects of external price pressures wane, the drag on  CPI inflation from the substantial degree of spare capacity in the economy should become apparent.  How fast and how far inflation falls will depend on:  the balance between demand and supply in the UK economy — and in particular the extent to which any factors weighing on demand also weigh on supply; the degree to which any persistent spare capacity pulls down costs and prices;  and the path of energy and other tradable goods and services prices.  There remains a range of views among Committee members about the likely evolution of those various factors, and around the overall outlook for inflation.  The Committee’s best collective judgement is, however, that inflation is rather more likely to be above the target than below it in the near term but, based on the conditioning assumptions described above, those risks are judged to be broadly balanced by the end of the forecast period.   Charts 5.12 and 5.13 show the GDP and CPI inflation projections for the next two years under the alternative assumption that Bank Rate is held constant at 0.5%.  As that path for Bank Rate is only a little lower than the path implied by market interest rates over the next two years, these projections are very similar to the fan charts conditioned on market interest rates.  In evaluating the outlook for growth, the Committee will focus on indicators of:  the prospects for the world economy, and in particular developments in the euro area;  the implications of those developments for the banking system and credit conditions;  households’ and businesses’ uncertainty;  the evolution of underlying productivity growth;  and the impact of the MPC’s asset purchases on demand.  In evaluating the outlook for inflation, the Committee will in addition focus on indicators of:  commodity and other global trade prices;  the degree of spare capacity in the economy;  unit labour costs;  and companies’ price-setting behaviour.   At its May meeting, the Committee noted that, despite the changes in the near-term outlook, the fundamental policy challenges following the financial crisis and subsequent recession remained the same.  GDP growth was likely to remain weak in the near term and to strengthen gradually thereafter. Developments in the euro area continued to pose a significant threat to that outlook.  Inflation had declined sharply since last autumn, broadly as the Committee had expected.  And although inflation was likely to remain above 2% for the next year or so, it was nevertheless likely to fall back gradually to around the target.  The Committee therefore decided that it was appropriate to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5% and the size of the asset purchase programme at £325 billion in order to meet the 2% CPI inflation target over the medium term.  8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 2008 09 10 11 12 13 14 Percentage increases in output on a year earlier + – Projection Bank estimates of past growth ONS data See footnote to Chart 5.1.

Chart 5.13 CPI inflation projection based on constant nominal interest rates at 0.5% and £325 billion asset purchases  48 Inflation Report  May 2012 Other forecasters’ expectations Every three months, the Bank asks a sample of external forecasters for their latest economic projections.  This box reports the results of the most recent survey, carried out during April.  On average, forecasters expected annual  CPI inflation to fall back to the 2% target by 2013 Q2 and to remain close to the target thereafter (Table 1).  The near-term profile for CPI inflation was somewhat higher than that reported three months ago:  the dispersion of central views about inflation one year ahead had shifted upwards a little (Chart A).  The average central projection for four-quarter GDP growth in 2013 Q2 was 1.7%.  Growth was expected to continue to increase gradually over the following two years (Table 1).   These forecasts assume somewhat less monetary stimulus than was assumed three months ago.  On average, projections of Bank Rate were little changed over the first year, but were slightly higher at years two and three.  And, on average, the expected level of asset purchases financed by central bank reserves was around £30 billion lower than projected three months ago.  The level of the sterling ERI was also expected, on average, to be somewhat higher over the next three years. The Bank also asks forecasters for their assessment of the risks around their central projections for GDP growth and  CPI inflation (Table 2).  The average likelihood of different  GDP growth outturns were broadly unchanged from the assessments made three months ago at the two and  three-year horizons.   In contrast, the average probabilities respondents attached to CPI inflation exceeding the inflation target had increased at the one, two and three-year horizons.  On average, respondents judged that the risks around the inflation target at the one-year horizon were broadly balanced.  But forecasters attached an average probability of almost 60% to inflation being above the 2% target at the three-year horizon.  And the average probability attached to inflation being above 3% in three years’ time had also increased a little, despite the unchanged average central projection (Chart B). 0  2  4  6  8  10  12  Expectation for 2013 Q1    in February 2012  Expectation for 2013 Q2    in May 2012  0.6  1.8  2.2  2.6  1.0  1.4  Number of forecasts  Range of forecasts(a)  3.0  3.4  Sources:  Projections of 25 outside forecasters as of 31 January 2012 and 24 outside forecasters as of 1 May 2012.

2013-11-13,"Inflation Report November 2013   BANK OF ENGLAND Inflation Report November 2013 In order to maintain price stability, the Government has set the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) a target for the annual inflation rate of the Consumer Prices Index of 2%. Subject to that, the MPC is also required to support the Government’s economic policy, including its objectives for growth and employment. The Inflation Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff under the guidance of the members of the Monetary Policy Committee.  It serves two purposes.  First, its preparation provides a comprehensive and forward-looking framework for discussion among MPC members as an aid to our decision-making.  Second, its publication allows us to share our thinking and explain the reasons for our decisions to those whom they affect. Although not every member will agree with every assumption on which our projections are based, the fan charts represent the MPC’s best collective judgement about the most likely paths for inflation, output and unemployment, as well as the uncertainties surrounding those central projections. This Report has been prepared and published by the Bank of England in accordance with  section 18 of the Bank of England Act 1998.

The gathering pace of expansion during 2013 was supported by an increase in domestic demand.  That reflects both an improvement in credit conditions — for example, rates on new loans to households have fallen significantly over the past year — and a reduction in uncertainty.  The easing of these headwinds has supported consumer spending and helped to revive the housing market:  housing activity and prices increased and housing investment rose robustly in the first half of this year. Leading indicators suggest that housing activity is likely to strengthen further in the near term. Although official statistics suggest that capital expenditure is yet to increase, companies’ investment intentions have also improved on the back of reduced uncertainty and improved access to credit, as well as stronger demand prospects.  The prospective revival of investment may be most pronounced for large companies since, despite some improvement, access to finance for small businesses remains constrained.  Companies’ plans may also be bolstered by a gradual recovery in world demand, although the extent to which UK companies are able In the United Kingdom, recovery has finally taken hold.  The economy is growing robustly as lifting uncertainty and thawing credit conditions start to unlock pent-up demand.  But significant headwinds — both at home and abroad — remain, and there is a long way to go before the aftermath of the financial crisis has cleared and economic conditions normalise.  That underpins the MPC’s intention to maintain the exceptionally stimulative stance of monetary policy until there has been a substantial reduction in the degree of economic slack.  The pace at which that slack is eroded, and the durability of the recovery, will depend on the extent to which productivity picks up alongside demand.  Productivity growth has risen in recent quarters, although unemployment has fallen by slightly more than expected on the back of strong output growth. CPI inflation fell to 2.2% in October.  The near-term outlook for inflation is lower than expected three months ago, reflecting unexpectedly low outturns and the recent appreciation of sterling. Inflation is set to fall back to around the 2% target over the next year or so as the impetus from past increases in import prices fades and a gradual revival in productivity growth, together with a persistent margin of spare capacity, curbs domestic price pressures.   6 Inflation Report  November 2013 to capitalise on that expansion may be tempered by the rise in sterling of around 3% over the past three months.   Since the August Report, the MPC has maintained Bank Rate at 0.5% and the size of its asset purchase programme at  £375 billion.  Short-term UK market interest rates have risen, partly reflecting the strength of domestic activity.  The projections below are based on the assumption that Bank Rate follows a path implied by market interest rates, rather than the constant rate assumption used in August.  That does not reflect the Committee’s view of the most likely path of Bank Rate;  it is simply a reversion to the convention of using the market curve now that financial markets have had the opportunity to absorb the policy guidance provided by the Committee in August.  On that basis, and assuming that the size of the asset purchase programme is maintained at £375 billion, the recent recovery is likely to be sustained (Chart 1).  Reduced uncertainty, especially regarding the risks to euro-area activity, and a continued easing in domestic credit conditions should help to release pent-up demand from households and companies.  And the strengthening of the housing market should support increased investment in the housing stock and higher demand for  housing-related goods and services.  The pace of growth is likely to ease back a little in the second and third years of the forecast, as some of the initial boost provided by the lifting of uncertainty and easing of credit conditions moderates.  The rise in Bank Rate implied by the market curve also acts to dampen growth over the forecast period.  Despite growth becoming entrenched, the legacy of adjustment and repair left by the financial crisis means that the recovery is likely to be subdued by historical standards. The external environment continues to pose the greatest threat to the recovery;  in particular, the necessary adjustments to indebtedness and competitiveness within the euro area may yet prove to be a much greater drag on growth.  At home, the continuing need for adjustment and balance sheet repair in both public and private sectors may mean that the recent boost to growth from the lifting of uncertainty proves short-lived.  In contrast, domestic demand may revive more quickly than anticipated if improvements in sentiment and spending feed off each other and so impart further momentum to growth.   The scope for economic expansion depends critically on the extent to which the unprecedented weakness in labour productivity seen over recent years unwinds as demand recovers. The stronger the revival in productivity, the slower will be the absorption of spare capacity and so the greater the scope for the economy to grow without generating inflationary pressure. Labour productivity growth picked up in the first half of 2013, suggesting that stronger demand is likely to elicit some response in productivity.  The recent increase in demand has, however, also led to a narrowing of spare capacity within companies and to a further edging down in the unemployment rate.  The headline Labour Force Survey (LFS) unemployment rate fell to 7.7% in August, a touch lower than expected three months ago.         9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 2009 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Percentage increases in output on a year earlier ONS data Projection Bank estimates of past growth + – Chart 1 GDP projection based on market interest rate expectations and £375 billion asset purchases The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for GDP growth.  It has been conditioned on the assumption that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remains at £375 billion throughout the forecast period. To the left of the vertical dashed line, the distribution reflects the likelihood of revisions to the data over the past; to the right, it reflects uncertainty over the evolution of GDP growth in the future.  If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that the mature estimate of GDP growth would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of those occasions.  The fan chart is constructed so that outturns are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter green areas on 30 occasions.  In any particular quarter of the forecast period, GDP growth is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fan on 90 out of 100 occasions.  And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions GDP growth can fall anywhere outside the green area of the fan chart.  Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey background.  See the box on page 39 of the November 2007 Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.    Overview 7 There remains a range of views on the Committee about the factors that led to the recent weakness in productivity and about the extent to which productivity will rise as demand increases.  But there is little in the recent data to alter those views materially and the MPC’s best collective judgement remains that productivity is likely to increase as the economy recovers, such that slack is eroded only gradually.  As a result, despite the sustained recovery in activity, and based on the same assumptions as Chart 1, the MPC attaches only around a two-in-five chance to the LFS unemployment rate having reached the 7% threshold by the end of 2014.  The corresponding figures for the end of 2015 and 2016 are around three in five and two in three respectively (Chart 2).  These probabilities are higher than in August, reflecting the stronger outlook for near-term demand.    Costs and prices CPI inflation fell from 2.9% in June to 2.2% in October, which is much lower than expected three months ago.  That unexpectedly large fall reflects both recent broad-based weakness in goods and services price inflation, together with a number of specific factors including:  the impact of recent falls in oil prices on petrol prices;  utility price increases occurring later than expected;  and a smaller contribution from university tuition fees this year.  Domestic cost pressures remain contained, with the weakness in productivity growth broadly matched by muted pay growth. Some measures of household inflation expectations have picked up;  that may have been a response to imminent utility price increases and so may prove temporary.  Measures of medium-term expectations derived from financial markets and professional forecasters were little changed, although some were slightly higher than their post-crisis average.  Overall, the MPC judges that medium-term inflation expectations remain sufficiently well anchored.   Chart 3 shows the Committee’s best collective judgement of the outlook for CPI inflation, based on the same assumptions as Chart 1.  Inflation is projected to fall a little further over the next year or so, as the impetus from import prices fades.  This near-term projection is lower than in August, reflecting the impact of unexpectedly low outturns and sterling’s recent appreciation.  In consequence, the probability of CPI inflation being at or above the 2.5% knockout 18 to 24 months ahead  is judged to be lower than in August, at around one third (Chart 4).  A gradual revival in productivity growth and a persistent margin of spare capacity should contain domestic price pressures, ensuring that inflation is close to target in the medium term, despite a continuing elevated contribution from administered and regulated prices.   There are a number of sources of uncertainty affecting the inflation outlook.

The swathes show the probability that unemployment has reached 7% by each quarter of the forecast period.  The  5 percentage points width of the swathes reflects the fact that there is uncertainty about the precise probability in any given quarter, but it should not be interpreted as a confidence interval.

Inflation will also be sensitive to developments in commodity prices and the exchange rate, both of which are prone to move sharply.  There remains a range of views among Committee members regarding the relative strength of these different factors.  The Committee’s best collective judgement is that the risks around the 2% inflation target are broadly balanced in the second and third years of the forecast. The policy decision A recovery appears to have finally taken hold;  even so, a sustained period of strong growth is likely to be needed before slack is materially eroded.  To that end, the Committee indicated in August that it intended to maintain the stance of policy at least until unemployment had reached 7%, provided that it did not entail material risks to price stability or financial stability.   At its November meeting, the Committee noted that the stronger near-term outlook for demand meant that, on the assumption that Bank Rate followed a path implied by market rates, unemployment was likely to fall more quickly than anticipated in August, while CPI inflation looked set to fall back to around the 2% target over the next year or so.  The pace with which unemployment fell back would, however, depend heavily on the extent to which the recovery in demand was accompanied by higher productivity.  The Committee judged that neither of its price stability knockouts had been breached, and noted that the Financial Policy Committee had concluded at its latest meeting that there had been no breach of the financial stability knockout. Its guidance therefore remained in place. The Committee reiterated that reaching the unemployment threshold would not necessarily trigger an immediate policy response.  Rather the setting of policy at that point would depend on the outlook for inflation relative to the target and on the need to provide continued support to output and employment.  In that regard, the Committee noted that its projections conditioned on the assumption that Bank Rate remained at 0.5% implied that no policy action was taken when the unemployment threshold was reached.  These projections suggested that inflation would be only a little above the target by the end of the forecast period, while growth was projected to be stronger, and unemployment to fall more rapidly, than in the case in which Bank Rate was assumed to rise in line with the market curve. In the light of both the economic outlook and its policy guidance, the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5% and the stock of asset purchases at £375 billion.

UK market interest rates  are, however, higher than at the time of the August Report.  Sterling appreciated by around 3%.   To date, the impact of higher UK market rates on loan rates facing households and businesses has been muted.  The availability of credit continued to improve.  Housing market activity and annual house price inflation picked up.  Money growth remained strong relative to its post-crisis average. 1.1 Monetary policy and financial markets Monetary policy  Monetary policy remains highly stimulative in advanced economies.  At its November meeting, the MPC voted to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5% and maintain the stock of asset purchases financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at £375 billion, consistent with its stated intention, at a minimum, to maintain the present highly stimulative stance of monetary policy at least until the unemployment rate falls to 7%, provided that this does not entail material risks to price stability or financial stability.(1) The reasons behind the MPC’s policy decisions since the August Report are discussed on page 15. In the United States, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) continued purchasing assets at a pace of US$85 billion per month.  Market participants had expected the FOMC to slow the rate of asset purchases in September, but it instead decided to await more evidence that the improvement in economic activity and labour market conditions would be sustained. At its 7 November meeting, the European Central Bank (ECB) cut its main refinancing rate by 0.25 percentage points to 0.25% and maintained the guidance, first provided in July, that it expects its key policy rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. Central banks in some emerging economies, by contrast, have tightened policy in recent months.  That was a response to elevated inflation and outflows of capital since May (Section 2). Central banks in Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey and India have, for example, raised interest rates, implemented capital controls and/or intervened in the foreign exchange markets.  Market interest rates In the run-up to the November Report, the path of Bank Rate implied by UK short-term interest rates (OIS rates) rose above 0.75% in 2015 Q3 (Chart 1.1).  When policy rates are near the Table 1.A Monitoring the MPC’s key judgements  Developments anticipated if August Report judgements had evolved as expected Developments since August Cost of credit Broadly on track • Modest declines in the cost of credit to households, as well as to large and small companies. • Slight softening in new lending rates for households.  New corporate lending rates little changed;  surveys suggest lower cost of credit. Credit availability Broadly on track • Further increases in credit availability. • Surveys suggest credit availability improved for households and larger companies;  SMEs still report difficulty accessing credit. Mortgage approvals Stronger than expected • Rise in mortgage approvals to above 60,000 by the end of the year. • Mortgage approvals above 60,000  by July. PNFC lending Slightly stronger than expected • Pace of decline in four-quarter PNFC net lending stabilising in Q3, gradually easing thereafter. • PNFC net lending continues to contract, albeit at a more modest pace than in 2013 Q2. Evolution of sterling Higher than expected • Sterling evolves in line with conditioning assumptions. • Sterling appreciated by around 3%.

The median expectation among economists polled by Reuters in late October was  for no change in Bank Rate until 2015 Q4, compared with  2015 Q2 in the run-up to the August Report (Chart 1.2).   UK short-term forward interest rates have been volatile, but were higher in the run-up to the November Report than three months earlier.(1) This probably, in part, reflects domestic factors.  For example, some of the rise since August may have reflected the market response to the MPC’s policy guidance: some market contacts had expected a lower rate than 7% for the unemployment threshold and less emphasis on the risks  to price and financial stability.  Recent unexpectedly strong  UK data have also played a role (Chart 1.3), although associated rises in short-term rates might have been more pronounced in the absence of the MPC’s policy guidance. Movements in UK short-term forward market interest rates probably also reflect international factors.  For example,  short-term market interest rates in some advanced economies appear to have responded to developments in the  United States and, in particular, to changes in market expectations of FOMC policy (Chart 1.3).  Although these interest rates have tended to move together in the past, this relationship appears to have strengthened since the spring.   It is hard to explain the high degree of correlation in  short-term interest rates, but it is possible that, despite significant differences in recent years, market participants expect developments in the advanced economies to be synchronised during their recoveries.   At longer maturities, safe-haven sovereign bond yields have also exhibited a high degree of correlation and, despite falls since mid-September, remain higher than in May — particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States (Chart 1.4).  These longer-term yields often move together,  in part because investors see advanced-economy bonds with similar risk characteristics as close substitutes. Euro-area periphery sovereign bond yields have generally fallen further since the August Report (Chart 1.4).  In part,  this reflects a continuation of the trend seen since the  ECB’s announcement in mid-2012 of Outright Monetary Transactions.  Some signs of improvement in the euro-area periphery economies may also have eased investors’ concerns.  Exchange rates The sterling effective exchange rate (ERI) has appreciated  by 3.3% since the August Report (Chart 1.5).

Chart 1.2 Indicators of when Bank Rate is expected  to rise (1) Recent movements in interest rates are discussed in Bean, C (2013),  ‘The UK economic outlook’, available at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2013/speech689.pdf.  Section 1 Money and asset prices 11 the euro.  These movements, which were broadly consistent with relative changes in market interest rates, may reflect a perception that the UK economic outlook has improved by more than those of its main trading partners. A proportion of the appreciation in sterling has reflected a weakening in some emerging-economy currencies since the spring.  Expectations that the FOMC would reduce the pace of its asset purchases in September contributed to large capital outflows from some emerging economies.  Actions taken by central banks in these economies, as well as the FOMC’s decision not to reduce the pace of its asset purchases, subsequently led to a partial recovery of these currencies. Equities The FTSE All-Share index was 2.4% higher in the run-up to  the November Report than at the time of the August Report. Over the year to date, UK, US and euro-area equity indices have risen, although emerging-economy equity prices remain lower than at the start of the year (Chart 1.6). Higher advanced-economy equity prices since the start of the year are likely to have reflected increased investor optimism regarding the economic outlook.  This, in turn, is likely to have driven expectations of higher future earnings, as well as a reduction in the compensation investors require for taking on risk.  These effects have, however, been partially offset by the associated rises in market interest rates, which raises the rate at which investors discount future returns and, other things equal, depresses equity prices. 1.2 The banking sector Banks’ access to funds affects their ability to lend to the real economy and the terms under which credit is provided. Financial regulation, such as capital and liquidity policy, can also influence the supply of credit. Bank funding spreads have been little changed since the August Report, following significant falls over the preceeding twelve months (Chart 1.7).  In part, those falls reflected international developments as concerns about euro-area prospects lessened, as well as actions taken by UK banks to strengthen their balance sheets.   Supply and demand factors in the wholesale debt issuance market have also played a role in reducing UK bank funding costs.  Banks have issued very little wholesale debt, reflecting access to alternative funding sources, including the Funding for Lending Scheme.  In addition, the volume of retail funding raised by banks has risen considerably over the past year — the  Bank Liabilities Survey (BLS) suggests that this predominantly reflects an increase in the supply of deposits from households and businesses.  The limited issuance of bank debt, coupled with continued investor demand, is likely to have made investors more willing to accept a lower return, reducing funding spreads. 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 2007 08 09 10 11 12 13 Indices:  2 January 2007 = 100 August Report $/£  Sterling ERI  €/£ Chart 1.5 Sterling exchange rates 40  50  60  70  80  90  100  110  120  130  140  150  2007 08 09 10 11 12 13 FTSE All-Share S&P 500  Euro Stoxx  Indices:  2 January 2007 = 100  August Report MSCI Emerging Markets Sources:  Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters Datastream.

Chart 1.7 UK banks’ indicative longer-term funding spreads  12 Inflation Report  November 2013 While funding spreads remained broadly stable, the rise in market interest rates since the August Report has raised banks’ overall wholesale funding costs a little.  According to the  BLS, banks’ and building societies’ cost of funding new loans increased in 2013 Q3, but was expected to change little in Q4. Changes in regulation may also influence the supply of credit. In late August, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) announced amendments to its current liquidity framework in response to a recommendation by the Financial Policy Committee (FPC).(1) Subject to meeting the PRA’s 7% core equity capital standard, firms now need to hold highly liquid assets broadly equivalent to an 80% Liquidity Coverage Ratio until January 2015, rising only gradually thereafter to reach 100% by the start of 2018.  This marks a relaxation in liquidity requirements and could, in conjunction with higher capital ratios, help support the flow of credit to the economy. 1.3 Corporate credit conditions Consistent with past improvements in bank funding conditions, credit conditions for private non-financial corporations (PNFCs), including the commercial real estate sector, have continued to ease since the August Report.  According to the Credit Conditions Survey (CCS), this easing was driven by various factors including:  competition among lenders for market share; competition from capital markets in the provision of finance; and the better economic outlook.  After strong net bond issuance earlier in the year, PNFCs repaid more finance than they raised in Q3.  Bank lending continued to contract, albeit at a slightly slower pace than in the previous quarter (Chart 1.8). Improvements in credit conditions have been greatest for large PNFCs, which tend to have better access to non-bank finance than smaller companies.  Indeed, some of the weakness in bank lending in recent years reflects large companies switching from bank to capital market finance.  The cost of borrowing for large PNFCs has remained favourable:  corporate bond spreads have been broadly stable and the CCS suggests that bank lending spreads continued to fall for large PNFCs in Q3. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), however, frequently lack access to the capital markets and are therefore more dependent on banks for their external finance.  Indicative median interest rates on new credit facilities to SMEs overall have fallen modestly since mid-2012 (Chart 1.9).  These rates do not, however, capture the full cost of credit facing SMEs, as they do not include the impact of fees or cashback deals. Furthermore, as lenders become more willing to extend credit to a wider pool of borrowers, falls in interest rates for some SMEs may be offset by banks charging higher interest rates to riskier ones.(2) Surveys of small businesses show more of an 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Nov.

Chart 1.8 Lending to non-financial businesses, by size(a)  Section 1 Money and asset prices 13 improvement in the cost of credit to SMEs:  for example, businesses responding to the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) survey reported that, on average, their cost of credit fell between mid-2012 and 2013 Q2 and continued to edge lower in Q3 (Chart 1.10).  Those surveys also suggest that the availability of credit has been improving over the past year  or so, albeit from a low base.  The outlook for corporate lending also depends on developments in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, which makes up around a third of lending to non-financial businesses.  Credit availability to the CRE sector, according to the CCS, has been improving over the past year despite some banks gradually reducing their exposures.  Respondents to the CCS also reported that the CRE sector contributed positively to PNFCs’ credit demand in 2013 Q3 for the first time in  three years.  Consistent with improved credit supply and demand in this sector, IPD data suggest that CRE capital values haven risen in London and in most regional markets. 1.4 Household credit conditions and the housing market Household credit conditions Household borrowing and spending decisions depend in part on the costs of servicing existing loans.  Effective interest rates on existing loans and credit facilities fell or were little changed in Q3, and remain lower than before the crisis (Table 1.B).  Rates on new household lending have fallen markedly since mid-2012.  Rates on both unsecured and secured loans to households continued to fall or were broadly stable in recent months (Chart 1.11).  Lenders responding to the CCS expect further compression in most household lending spreads in Q4.  Since mid-2012, falls in unsecured loan rates have been accompanied by improvements in credit availability and, according to the CCS, a rise in demand for unsecured credit. These improvements have fed through to a strong pickup in unsecured lending, including car finance, over the past year.  According to the CCS, the availability of secured credit also increased in Q3, with significant increases in the demand for lending for house purchase and remortgaging.  The number  of approvals for house purchase rose to around 67,000 in September, a faster rise than expected by the MPC, with approvals for remortgaging also picking up (Table 1 on  page 20). Housing market Alongside higher mortgage approvals, other housing market activity indicators have continued to pick up since the  August Report.  Property transactions, which have been supported by a fairly steady number of cash buyers since  the start of the crisis, continued to rise (Table 1 on page 20).

Chart 1.12 House prices and near-term indicators of house prices  14 Inflation Report  November 2013 And estate agents expect stronger growth in sales in the next three months.  There are some signs that the supply of properties for sale has picked up more slowly than demand. For example, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) survey suggests that growth in new buyer enquiries has outstripped that in new instructions to sell.  Consistent with that, the RICS measure of the ratio of sales to stocks, an indicator of housing market tightness, rose a little.   Alongside the pickup in housing market activity, house prices have continued to rise.  The Halifax and Nationwide house price indices, for example, rose by 8.1% and 5.8% respectively in the year to October.  Several forward-looking indicators, such as the RICS price expectations measure, point to further increases over the next few months (Chart 1.12).  National average house prices have risen slightly relative to earnings (Chart 1.13), suggesting a reduction in affordability.  This ratio nevertheless remains well below the levels reached in 2007. And, reflecting the current low level of interest rates, income gearing (interest payments and regular repayments of mortgage principal as a proportion of disposable income) remains relatively low (Chart 1.13). As discussed in the box on pages 20–21, the evolution of the housing market affects the level of domestic demand and hence the outlook for inflation in the medium term.  To some extent, the effect of the pickup in the housing market depends on the degree to which it is confined to particular regions. House price inflation has been higher in regions, such as London, where house prices are above the national average. Most measures of regional house prices, however, suggest  that house prices have also, to varying degrees, risen in other regions (Chart 1.14).  1.5 Money Four-quarter broad money growth, at 4.3% in 2013 Q3  (Chart 1.15), remains well below pre-recession levels, but has been stronger than four-quarter growth in nominal GDP, which stood at 3.5% in Q2. The bulk of aggregate money growth was accounted for by households (Chart 1.15), particularly flows into sight deposits. In principle, this could signal strong future spending growth. Flows into sight deposits may, however, simply reflect a low opportunity cost of holding these, given low deposit rates.   PNFC money has increasingly contributed to aggregate money growth (Chart 1.15).  It is possible that corporates have been accumulating larger cash balances than in the past because they are concerned about the future availability of external funding.  Some of these cash balances could be used to finance future spending, as companies become more confident about the economic outlook (Section 2). 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 1991 95 99 2003 07 11 Income gearing(a)   (right-hand scale)  Ratio of house prices to earnings(b)   (left-hand scale)  Percentage of post-tax income Ratio Sources:  Bank of England, Halifax, Nationwide, ONS and Bank calculations.

Chart 1.15 Contributions to twelve-month broad money growth  Section 1 Money and asset prices 15 Monetary policy since the August Report The MPC’s central projection in the August Report, under  the assumptions that Bank Rate remained at 0.5% and that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remained at £375 billion, was for a sustained expansion in both demand and supply.  Under the same assumptions, the MPC judged that CPI inflation was likely to remain close to 3% in the near term, before falling back to around the 2% target over the forecast period.  In the August Report, the MPC announced its intention neither to raise Bank Rate from its current rate of 0.5%, nor to reduce  the stock of asset purchases, at least until the LFS headline unemployment rate had fallen to 7%, subject to it not entailing material risks to price stability or financial stability. There had been some notable developments in the month preceding the MPC’s meeting on 3–4 September.  For example, domestically, there had been increased signs that  a recovery was taking hold.  The GDP data for the second quarter had been revised up, and survey indicators of activity had been upbeat.  That had been accompanied by higher sterling market interest rates.  The Committee judged that  the data represented upside news relative to the growth profile described in the August Inflation Report.  The LFS unemployment rate had remained at 7.8%, some way above the 7% threshold.  All members agreed that none of the conditions that would override the Committee’s guidance had been breached.  Against the backdrop of indicators of stronger near-term growth than seemed likely a month earlier, there were tentative signs that the degree of spare capacity within companies might be beginning to diminish.  But it remained too early to assess how likely it was that effective supply capacity would increase as demand recovered, thus moderating any additional inflationary impetus resulting from that extra demand.  If sustained, the appreciation of sterling meant that CPI inflation was marginally less likely than a month ago to be above 2.5% in 18–24 months’ time.  There had been little news regarding medium-term inflation expectations and therefore little reason to shift the Committee’s judgement that medium-term inflation expectations remained sufficiently anchored.  The FPC had not met since the MPC’s policy guidance had been announced, but were expected to comment on the financial stability consequences of the current monetary policy stance before the MPC’s next meeting.   Against that backdrop, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5% and maintain the stock of  asset purchases at £375 billion.   At the time of its meeting on 8–9 October, the MPC judged that the news during the month had continued to suggest a recovery in activity in the United Kingdom.  Monetary stimulus remained considerable and confidence appeared to be rising. On their own, business surveys were pointing to an increase  in output of around 2% over the second half of the year, although the Bank staff’s latest projection was somewhat weaker.  The revival of the housing market was likely to provide a fillip to both dwellings investment and consumer spending.  Recent increases in market interest rates had been partially reversed and credit availability had continued to improve.  Sterling had appreciated a little on the month, which would reduce the extent to which import prices were squeezing households’ real incomes, and therefore the boost to consumption.  But set against that, the exchange rate appreciation would support import growth and dampen  export growth in the medium term.  The headline LFS unemployment rate had fallen but, at 7.7% in the three months to July, remained well above the Committee’s 7% threshold.  The recent reduction in the unemployment rate indicated that the slack in the economy was, as anticipated, diminishing as activity picked up.  If anything, that was occurring a little faster than envisaged at the time of the August Report, although it remained unusually difficult to gauge the degree of slack in the economy.   All Committee members agreed that none of the conditions that would override the policy guidance provided in August had been breached.  Sterling had appreciated a little on the month and there had been little news on domestically generated inflationary pressures.  There had also been little news regarding medium-term inflation expectations.  The FPC had agreed at its meeting on 18 September that the financial stability knockout had not been breached.  Against that backdrop, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5% and to maintain the stock of  asset purchases at £375 billion. At its meeting on 6–7 November, the MPC voted to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%.  The Committee also voted to maintain the stock of asset purchases at £375 billion.  The Committee reached its decisions in the context of the policy guidance announced in the August Report.  16 Inflation Report  November 2013 UK output was broadly flat in 2011 and 2012, but growth has since picked up to around its historical average rate.  The ONS provisionally estimated that GDP rose by 0.8% in Q3, with business surveys pointing to continued momentum in Q4 (Section 3).  Nominal spending growth, however, remained subdued in H1 (Table 2.B), as stronger real activity was offset by lower growth in the GDP deflator. World demand growth has also increased since the start of 2013, and by more than was anticipated at the time of the August Report.  That primarily reflected slightly stronger growth in the euro area than expected.  The outlook for some emerging economies has worsened over the past three months (Table 2.A). The increase in UK growth since the start of 2013 reflects several interrelated developments.  Over the past year, credit conditions have eased (Section 1), consumer and business confidence have risen and uncertainty has faded (Chart 2.1). Those developments are likely, in part, to reflect domestic factors, including the highly stimulative stance of monetary policy, the Funding for Lending Scheme, and steps taken by regulators to strengthen the resilience of the UK financial system.  International factors — in particular a reduction in the likelihood of disorderly adjustment in the euro area — are also likely to have contributed to improved sentiment and credit conditions.  That is consistent with the synchronisation of the increases in UK and euro-area growth. 2.1 Domestic demand Household spending Household spending has risen modestly over the past two years.  That was almost entirely accounted for by spending on durable and semi-durable goods, in particular cars: spending on vehicles and spare parts accounts for around one third of the 3% increase in consumption since 2011 Q3. Consumption growth slowed a little in Q2, to 0.3% (Table 2.B) — weaker than anticipated at the time of the August Report. 2 Demand The UK recovery gathered pace in 2013 H1, as the headwinds to domestic demand from credit conditions and uncertainty eased.  World demand growth also increased, and by more than was anticipated, largely reflecting a pickup in activity in the euro area.  UK GDP is estimated to have risen by 0.8% in Q3, with indicators of household spending remaining firm.

Spending on food, drink and tobacco fell sharply in Q2, reducing growth by 0.3 percentage points.  That fall looks unusual compared with retail sales data and is expected to have reversed in Q3.  With other indicators suggesting that spending rose modestly in the past three months, overall consumption growth in Q3 is expected to have rebounded to a little above 0.5%. The rise in consumer spending since 2011 Q3 has occurred despite little increase in household real income during that period (Chart 2.2).  Instead, higher consumption, especially in recent quarters, has been associated with falls in the household saving ratio (Chart 2.3).  Following the financial crisis, tight credit conditions, heightened uncertainty, and lower expected income encouraged households to save a greater proportion of their income.  So the recent reductions in the saving ratio suggest the downward pressure on spending from these factors may be waning. Surveys suggest that households’ income expectations rose and they became less uncertain about the outlook during the past year.  According to the GfK survey, households’ expectations about their own financial position improved gradually during 2012 and 2013 Q1, and have risen markedly since mid-2013.  The net balance of households expecting unemployment to rise over the next year mirrored that (Chart 2.4).  Nonetheless, results from the 2013 NMG Consulting survey suggest that many households are still quite pessimistic about the outlook:  around one fifth of respondents think it quite likely that their income will fall sharply over the next year, and a third think there is a small chance that will happen.(1) In the 2012 survey, almost two thirds of households thought there was at least some chance that their income would fall sharply in the next year. There are also signs that looser credit conditions have stimulated consumption.  For example, the net flow of unsecured lending to households has risen to around £0.6 billion per month since January, from a monthly average of close to zero between 2009 and 2012.  That is likely to reflect substantial falls in personal loan rates over the past year (Section 1), as well as an increase in households’ appetite to borrow as sentiment improved.  In addition, the proportion of households reporting in the NMG Consulting survey that they had put off spending due to concerns about credit remains much higher than before the financial crisis.  Increased spending on cars is also consistent with households responding to improved credit conditions, as car purchases are often financed through loans. (1) The survey was conducted by NMG Consulting on behalf of the Bank between 12 and 30 September.  The survey, which was undertaken online, covered around 6,000 British households and was designed and weighted to be a representative sample. A detailed analysis of the survey results will be published in the forthcoming 2013 Q4 Quarterly Bulletin.  18 Inflation Report  November 2013 The near-term outlook for household spending is a little stronger than anticipated at the time of the August Report, with growth now expected to average around 0.5% or a little more per quarter in early 2014 (Section 5).  The drag from credit conditions and uncertainty appears to be waning more quickly than expected three months ago.  And, as explained in the box on pages 20–21, the improving housing market is expected to provide an additional fillip to household spending. Nevertheless, it is likely that some households have not yet fully repaired their balance sheets in the wake of the crisis:  in the 2013 NMG Consulting survey around 30% of households reported that concerns about debt were causing them to cut spending, only a little lower than the 35% or so who answered in this way in the 2012 survey.  That continuing balance sheet adjustment, coupled with muted growth in real income is likely to restrain the pace of consumption growth in coming years to below historical rates. Housing investment Private sector housing investment — comprising new dwellings, improvements to existing dwellings and spending on services associated with property transactions — accounts for around one third of total private sector investment.  Growth has picked up since the end of 2012 (Table 2.B), largely accounted for by newly built dwellings (Chart 2.5).  That strengthening in housing investment is likely to have reflected an easing in credit conditions and a reduction in uncertainty. In addition, the Government’s Help to Buy equity scheme, which provides equity loans for the purchase of new-build properties, is likely to have boosted house building and so investment in new dwellings. These factors should continue to support a revival in housing market activity in coming quarters.  The Government’s Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme — which aims to increase the availability of mortgages for buyers with relatively small deposits by providing lenders with partial insurance — is also likely to boost activity.  As explained in the box on pages 20–21, further increases in housing market activity are likely to raise new dwellings investment;  that would be consistent with the sharp pickup in housing starts over the past year.  Increases in the number of property transactions are also likely to be associated with higher spending on services associated with property purchases.  Consequently, the near-term outlook for housing investment is stronger than anticipated three months ago. Business spending Business investment is reported by the ONS to have contracted during Q2 (Table 2.B), a weaker outturn than expected at the time of the August Report.  But methodological changes implemented in the 2013 Blue Book have made the data more volatile, and that weakening is not judged to contain much news.(1) The official data contrast with Chart 2.3 Household saving ratio 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 1987 92 97 2002 07 12 Recessions(a) Saving ratio(b) Per cent (a) Recessions are defined as at least two consecutive quarters of falling output (at constant market prices) estimated using the latest data.

Chart 2.4 Survey measures of household expectations (1) For more details on these changes, see the box on page 20 of the August 2013 Report.  Section 2 Demand 19 surveys of investment intentions, which suggest that investment recovered a little in the year to Q2 (Chart 2.6). These indicators picked up further in Q3. The headwinds to investment growth from credit constraints have eased over the past year, as the cost and availability of bank credit and of capital market finance have improved (Section 1).  And the recovery in demand growth may have increased the internal funds available to some companies for investment:  analysis by Bank staff suggests that investment by many smaller, privately owned companies tends to be sensitive to variations in their internal funds — that is, their cash flow after operating expenses have been paid. A recent survey by the Bank’s Agents suggests that the drag on investment growth from uncertainty has lessened over the past year.  The net balance of businesses reporting in the survey that uncertainty was discouraging investment was around 5%;  in a similar survey conducted a year ago, it had been close to 50%.  Over coming quarters, lower uncertainty may prompt larger companies that have built up substantial financial surpluses to begin spending those funds. Companies’ investment decisions also depend on their capacity utilisation and demand expectations.  These factors may cause some businesses to invest more:  surveys indicate that spare capacity within companies has narrowed since the end of 2012, while expectations of near-term growth have risen (Section 3).  But given the persistent weakness in demand since the recession many other businesses are likely still to have ample spare capacity.  And some may want to wait for more signs that the recovery is entrenched before increasing investment.  On balance, business investment is expected to rise by around, or a little above, 2% per quarter in 2014 H1. Business spending on stocks provided a substantial boost to growth in 2013 Q2 (Table 2.B).  It is likely that some companies had to rebuild inventories, after running them down in Q1 when demand was stronger than expected. Indicators of stock adequacy in the CBI surveys were close to their long-run averages in Q3, suggesting that stockbuilding is unlikely to have provided a further significant boost to demand. Government spending The fiscal consolidation is set to continue.  ONS data show that public sector net borrowing averaged 7.0% of nominal GDP in the year to 2013 Q2, down from 7.4% in 2012/13.(1) Estimates by the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggest that around 40% of the fiscal consolidation relative to the March 2008 Budget has so far taken place (Chart 2.7).

For example, housing market transactions rose to above 90,000 in September, having averaged around 75,000 per month from 2010 to 2012.  And indices of house prices have increased:  the Nationwide and Halifax measures indicate that the average house price rose by around 2% in the past three months, although there was significant variation across regions.  Survey indicators point to continued momentum in the housing market in the near term (Section 1). The housing market affects the economy in various ways.  It can affect the level of domestic demand and so the outlook for inflation in the medium term.  And it can have implications for financial stability.  Changes in the housing market will also affect the allocation of resources across companies and sectors, as well as debt levels in the economy.  This box focuses on the first of these effects.  The implications of recent housing market developments for financial stability will be discussed in the forthcoming November 2013 Financial Stability Report. Links between the housing market and demand A key link between the housing market and demand is housing investment (Chart 2.5).(1) Housing investment comprises investment in new dwellings, improvements to existing dwellings and spending on services associated with the sale and purchase of property — for example, fees and commission paid to lawyers and surveyors, and stamp duty.  Although private sector housing investment accounts for only around 5% of GDP, it can still have substantial effects on aggregate demand:  for example, the 40% fall during the 2008/09 recession accounted for about one quarter of the fall in GDP. The revival in housing market activity is expected to raise housing investment.  In part, that is because house building is likely to increase — indeed, the increase in transactions has already been associated with a rise in the number of housing starts (Table 1).  A rise in the number of housing market transactions should also be associated with higher spending on services associated with home moves, such as conveyancing. Spending on home improvements is, however, less sensitive to changes in housing market activity:  many of those who move home are likely to improve their new property;  but, had they been unable to move, some might have made improvements to their existing home instead. Past episodes of rising house prices have tended to be associated with increases in household consumption.  In large part, that is because some of the factors that influence the housing market, such as credit conditions and income expectations, are likely to affect consumer spending too.  But increased housing market activity and house prices may directly lead to higher spending in a number of ways.(2) One reason why the housing market revival may directly boost consumption is because it increases spending on certain durable goods, such as washing machines and fridges.  Bank staff estimate that households are two to three times more likely to purchase white goods when they move home.(3) The effect on consumption through this channel is, however, likely to be limited, since these goods account for only a small proportion of total household spending;  even a 10% increase in purchases of white goods would boost consumption growth by less than 1 percentage point.  And the boost would be even smaller if households funded these purchases in part by spending less on other items. The housing market might have an additional effect on spending by existing homeowners because a rise in house prices increases the value of housing collateral, thus allowing some of them to access credit on better terms.  For example, higher house prices should enable some homeowners to remortgage at a lower loan to value ratio and so reduce their mortgage rate.  Alternatively, these homeowners could remortgage and increase the amount borrowed.  At present, remortgaging activity remains low relative to its pre-recession levels (Table 1).  Higher house prices could also lead to higher spending by some existing homeowners if the increase in the value of their housing collateral means that they feel able to reduce their precautionary savings. Changes in house prices may also lead to changes in consumer spending because they affect households’ lifetime resources. The effect would differ depending on where households are in their life cycle.  For those who expect to trade down, or sell up Table 1 Mortgage approvals, housing transactions and house building Thousands Monthly averages 1997– 2010– 2012 2013 2007 11 Q1 Q2 Q3 Mortgage approvals for remortgaging 75 30 28 28 32 35 Mortgage approvals for house purchase 103 48 51 53 57 64 Housing market transactions(a) 119 73 78 82 85 91 Housing starts(b) 15.2 8.8 8.1 8.8 10.9 n.a.

Section 2 Demand 21 completely, higher house prices translate into an increase in wealth, and so are likely to encourage higher spending.  But for first-time buyers and those who expect to trade up, higher house prices are more likely to be associated with lower spending — for example, if they have to save more for a deposit or have to take out a larger mortgage and so have higher debt-servicing costs.  Studies using data on individual households, however, do not provide convincing evidence that house prices affect consumption through such effects on household resources.(4) Overall, the recent increases in housing market activity and house prices are expected to be associated with a somewhat stronger outlook for consumer spending than was expected three months ago.  That largely reflects the fact that both the housing market and consumption are affected by credit conditions, sentiment and income expectations, and these appear to be improving more rapidly than anticipated at the time of the August Report. The revival in the housing market could also affect the level of spending in the economy — and potential supply — through its effects on small and medium-sized businesses.  As the owners of some smaller companies use their homes as collateral against business loans, higher house prices may increase the value of their collateral, and therefore allow them to access credit on better terms.  As well as encouraging investment by existing businesses, collateral effects could also increase the flow of finance to newer companies. Other macroeconomic implications The increases in housing market activity and house prices could have broader macroeconomic effects than those discussed above.  For example, rises in house prices will affect banks’ balance sheets:  mortgage debt accounts for three quarters of the stock of UK sterling loans to the domestic non-financial private sector.  They could also affect the allocation of resources across companies and sectors, as well as debt levels in the economy.  Such developments have implications for both price and financial stability. The MPC will monitor closely these broader implications, in part because a period of financial instability could endanger medium-term price stability too.  But potential risks to financial stability emanating from the housing market would be addressed in the first instance by the Financial Policy Committee, working with the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.  These risks will be discussed in the forthcoming November 2013 Financial Stability Report. (1) The links between housing market activity and dwellings investment are also discussed in the box on page 20 of the February 2012 Report. (2) The common factors and causal links that lie behind the association between house prices and consumer spending are discussed in detail in Benito, A, Thompson, J, Waldron, M and Wood, R (2006), ‘House prices and consumer spending’, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Summer, pages 142–54.

In part, that is because different types of consolidation — for example, lowering benefits or cutting government spending — will affect demand differently.  In addition, the effects of these measures are likely to take time to work through, with different lags for each type of measure. The direct drag on GDP growth from the consolidation is expected to persist throughout 2013/14 — although it is uncertain what would have happened in its absence. 2.2 External demand and UK trade World demand growth has increased since the start of 2013, primarily reflecting slightly stronger growth than expected in the euro area.  In part reflecting the rise in euro-area activity, UK-weighted world trade growth picked up in Q2.  The outlook for world demand is similar to that anticipated at the time of the August Report.  But, within that, near-term growth in the euro area is expected to be a little stronger than previously projected, while prospects for some emerging economies have deteriorated (Table 2.A).  22 Inflation Report  November 2013 Table 2.C GDP in selected countries and regions(a) Percentage changes on a quarter earlier, annualised(b) Averages 2012 2013 1998–2007 H1 H2 Q1 Q2 Q3 United Kingdom 3.1 -1.0 0.6 1.6 2.8 3.2 Euro area (40%) 2.3 -0.8 -1.3 -0.9 1.1 n.a.

The euro area Euro-area GDP increased by 0.3% in Q2, having contracted slightly in the previous quarter (Table 2.C).  Part of that pickup reflected a rebound in German GDP after it was depressed by cold weather in Q1.  Indicators such as business surveys and industrial production data suggest that euro-area output rose further in Q3, albeit by less than in Q2.  The return to growth is likely to have been supported by increased consumer and business confidence, as the likelihood of disorderly adjustment in the euro area has receded.  Spending may have been boosted by an easing in credit conditions too:  for example, average interest rates on new mortgages and business loans have fallen by around 0.5 percentage points since the first half of 2012 (Table 2.D).  While credit conditions have improved across the euro area, they remain tighter in periphery countries. The adjustments needed to raise competitiveness and reduce indebtedness in the periphery are, nevertheless, still substantial and are likely to occur slowly.  As a result, euro-area growth is expected to average around a quarter of a percentage point in 2013 H2 and 2014 H1, and the medium-term outlook remains fragile. The United States US GDP grew by 0.6% in 2013 Q2 (Table 2.C), stronger than in the previous two quarters.  But there are signs that the recovery has moderated recently.  For example, the pace of employment growth has eased in the past six months (Chart 2.8).  In addition, interest rates on new mortgage lending rose by close to 1 percentage point over Q2 and Q3 (Table 2.D);  possibly as a result of that tightening in credit conditions, activity in the housing market has softened. Reflecting those developments, the FOMC has maintained the pace of its asset purchases (Section 1). The near-term outlook is little changed from three months ago.  Although the temporary government shutdown will have reduced government output in Q4, that is likely to result in only a small reduction in GDP.  There is, however, a risk that the political uncertainty, if it re-escalates, damages consumer and business confidence, so reducing domestic spending. Rest of the world Japanese GDP growth was much stronger in 2013 H1 than in 2012 H2 (Table 2.C), largely reflecting a pickup in consumption growth and a larger contribution from net trade. And output indicators suggest that growth remained robust in Q3.  That strength is likely to have been associated with recent fiscal stimulus and reforms, alongside the monetary stimulus launched in April 2013.(1) The announcement of an increase in the consumption tax planned for April 2014 could encourage (1) For more details, see the box on page 10 of the May 2013 Report.  Section 2 Demand 23 some households to bring forward spending and boost growth temporarily, but growth would then be expected to weaken in the latter part of 2014. Chinese GDP rose by 7.8% in the year to Q3 (Table 2.C), broadly in line with the government’s announced target.  But prospects for some other emerging economies, such as India and Indonesia (Table 2.E), appear more fragile.  Expectations that the FOMC might begin to reduce the pace of its asset purchases, alongside downward revisions to near-term outlooks and projections for potential growth in the longer term, were associated with large capital outflows from some emerging economies between May and September, alongside sharp falls in equity prices and their exchange rates (Section 1). Those developments were particularly pronounced in countries with significant external imbalances and elevated consumer price inflation (Table 2.E).  The FOMC’s announcement that it would maintain the pace of asset purchases, and policy tightening by central banks in some of the affected economies, have been associated with improved financial market conditions since early September.  The tighter monetary conditions may, however, mean that growth in these countries over 2013–14 will be weaker than previously expected (Chart 2.9). Localised disruption in the most vulnerable emerging economies would probably have limited negative effects on the UK economy through direct trade linkages, since their weight in UK exports is small (Table 2.E).  And there may be some downward effect on inflation from lower commodity prices.  But more widespread disruption could have a material adverse impact:  in total, emerging economies account for around one quarter of UK exports;  and other advanced economies would also face weaker demand for their exports, which would then lower their demand for UK exports.  There could also be adverse effects through financial linkages.  For example, some UK banks have operations in emerging economies and any losses sustained on those loans may affect their ability to extend credit to UK borrowers. UK trade and the current account UK exports rose by just 0.4% on average each quarter between 2009 and 2013 Q1.  That was well below the average growth rate in the decade prior to the recession (Table 2.B) despite the large depreciation of sterling in 2007–08.  In part, that reflects the weakness of world trade growth during that period.  But the share of world trade captured by UK exporters also continued to decline.  That decline is largely accounted for by exports of services — in particular, business and financial services.  In contrast, the export share for goods, which had been falling in the decade before the depreciation, has been broadly flat.(1) Table 2.E Summary statistics for selected emerging economies Brazil India Indonesia South Turkey Africa Current account in 2013(a) (percentage of nominal GDP) -3.4 -4.4 -3.4 -6.1 -7.4 Consumer price inflation in  2013(a) (per cent) 6.3 10.9 7.3 5.9 6.6 Share in UK exports(b) (per cent) 0.8 1.4 0.2 1.0 1.0 Sources:  IMF WEO October 2013 and ONS.

Exports rose markedly in Q2 (Chart 2.10).  Given the pickup in UK-weighted world trade, that left the UK export share little changed, as anticipated.  More timely data show that UK goods exports fell by almost 5% in Q3.  But these data are volatile and so may overestimate the extent to which UK export growth slowed.  The recent appreciation of sterling (Section 1) could, however, hamper export growth in the future if sustained. Despite stronger export growth, the trade deficit was broadly unchanged in Q2 (Chart 2.11), as imports also rose markedly, broadly in line with domestic demand (Table 2.B).  More timely data indicate that the trade deficit widened substantially in Q3. The current account remained in deficit in Q2, partly reflecting the trade deficit.  But net investment income has also been in deficit since 2012 Q2, whereas it was in surplus for most of the decade before the crisis (Chart 2.11).  That reversal was largely accounted for by a fall in the income earned by UK PNFCs resident abroad.  The decline in UK PNFCs’ foreign earnings appears to reflect a fall in average returns, rather than in the stock of assets.  It is unclear whether those falls will persist. 24 Inflation Report  November 2013 Chart 2.11 UK current account 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 2005 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 Investment income(a) Trade balance Current transfers Current account balance Percentages of nominal GDP  + – (a) Includes compensation of employees.

Section 3 Output and supply 25 A central question regarding the outlook is the extent to  which productivity will recover alongside demand.  In the August Report, the MPC expected the stronger demand outlook to be largely matched by an expansion in supply. Private sector output per hour grew by 0.6% in Q2, close to its pre-recession average.  But unexpectedly strong output growth in Q3 (Section 3.1) was accompanied by greater rises than expected in both capacity utilisation and employment (Section 3.2).  The headline unemployment rate has fallen a little more than expected at the time of the August Report (Table 3.A) (Section 3.3). 3.1 Output Output is estimated to have risen by 0.8% in Q3.  That was materially stronger than projected by Bank staff at the time of the August Report, with the outturn at the upper end of the range of expectations (Chart 3.1).  A range of business surveys suggest that Q4 output growth will also be strong (Chart 3.2). The Bank staff projection for growth in Q4 is 0.9%, although the historical average error is high at 0.3 percentage points. At a sectoral level, services output growth was solid at 0.7% in Q3, underpinned by strong growth in distribution as well as business and financial services output.  It remains, however, below its pre-crisis trend rate.  Manufacturing output growth of 0.9% in Q3 was strong compared both to 2012 rates (Chart 3.3) and its pre-recession average.  Construction was the fastest-growing sector, with growth of 2.5% in Q3, boosted by a sharp increase in house-building activity (Section 2).  According to survey indicators, momentum in construction output growth is set to continue. Homebuilders have, however, reported marked increases in skill shortages as well as shortages of bricks and other building materials.  Those shortages may pose a risk to the pace of growth in the near term, although the latter may gradually ease if materials manufacturers are able to bring mothballed capacity back into use.  3 Output and supply Output is estimated to have risen by 0.8% in Q3 and recent indicators point to a continuation of strong growth in Q4.  Both employment and productivity rose in Q2, and are likely to do so again in Q3.  Reflecting unexpectedly strong labour demand, the headline LFS unemployment rate fell a touch more than anticipated to 7.7% in August.

GDP is at market prices.  The magenta diamond shows Bank staff’s central projection for the preliminary estimate of GDP growth for Q3 at the time of the August Report.  The green diamond shows the current staff projection for the preliminary estimate of GDP growth for Q4.  The bands on either side of the diamonds show uncertainty around those projections based on staff estimates of the root mean squared errors of forecasts for quarterly GDP growth made since 2004.  As the staff projections are for the preliminary estimates of GDP, they can differ from those used to construct the GDP fans, for example that shown in Chart 5.1, because those fans are based on the MPC’s best collective judgement of the final estimate of GDP.  26 Inflation Report  November 2013 3.2 Productivity and capacity utilisation Explaining the path of productivity over the past Labour productivity growth has been unusually weak since 2008, such that output per hour worked is more than 15% below the level implied by an extrapolation of its pre-crisis trend.  Based on the MPC’s central GDP backcast,(1) output mismeasurement can explain around half a percentage point of this shortfall.  And the pre-crisis trend may also be a misleading comparison, given structural changes in some industries, such as oil and gas extraction.  But the bulk of the weakness reflects more fundamental causes.  These can be divided into two broad categories:  those directly related to the weakness of demand;  and those where some other factor is at work, potentially affecting both demand and supply. Companies’ employment decisions, reflected in strong employment growth in the face of weak demand (Chart 3.4), have weighed on productivity.  Some businesses are likely to have retained skilled employees because they would otherwise be costly to replace when demand recovers.  Other businesses will have needed to retain a minimum number of staff to continue operating, so will have been limited in their ability to reduce their workforces.  And in the face of weak demand, some companies may have found it necessary to refocus their employees’ efforts towards winning business, rather than creating output directly.  The weakness of wage growth — particularly since mid-2012 (Section 4) — is also likely to have encouraged companies to keep hold of employees. Weak demand may have also affected productivity directly if companies have missed out on productivity advances they would have otherwise made through learning by doing. According to the Bank’s Agency contacts, however, this effect has been offset by companies striving harder to make efficiency gains.  If the sluggishness of productivity growth primarily reflects the direct effects of weak demand, it could pick up strongly as demand recovers and companies use their existing workforces more effectively.  But even in this case, the revival in productivity may still take time to come through.  For example, businesses may need to retrain their staff in order to take advantage of stronger demand.  Weak labour productivity growth could also reflect factors other than weak demand, the effects of which may persist even as the economy recovers.  One factor that may have impeded productivity is reduced reallocation of capital and labour from less productive businesses towards more productive ones.  Indeed, around half of all productivity growth at the economy-wide level in the years prior to 2008 occurred through this channel, but reallocation appears to have made no contribution to productivity growth in 2010 and Chart 3.2 Survey indicators of expected near-term growth in manufacturing and services output(a) 3 2 1 0 1 2 2000 02 04 06 08 10 12 14 Percentage changes on a quarter earlier BCC CBI Markit/CIPS(b) + – Sources:  BCC, CBI, CBI/PwC, Markit Economics, ONS and Bank calculations.

Section 3 Output and supply 27 2011.(1) The low level of Bank Rate, as well as forbearance by both HMRC and banks, has supported businesses in the face of weak demand.  Such support may have allowed some viable businesses to remain in operation through the downturn.  But it may also have supported other less viable businesses, who may find it hard to make a profit even when demand recovers. In addition, tighter credit conditions and uncertainty may have held back expansion by more productive companies.  If productivity growth has primarily been held back by such impediments, it could be quite slow to pick up and will depend in part on developments in credit and uncertainty.   Elevated uncertainty about the outlook for demand and tighter credit conditions since the financial crisis have also weighed on productivity by dampening investment.  For example, uncertainty is likely to have encouraged some businesses to adopt more labour-intensive production techniques, because hiring is typically a more flexible way to increase capacity than investment.  As a result, the capital stock, and as a consequence the capital-labour ratio, has risen by less than would otherwise have been the case, dragging on labour productivity growth.  It will take some time for any pickup in investment growth to boost the capital stock materially. Prospects for productivity  Private sector output per hour rose by 0.6% in Q2, which was just under the pre-crisis average growth rate.  But the outlook for productivity remains uncertain.  Companies’ capacity utilisation and employment provide evidence on the likely evolution of productivity during 2013 H2.  In August the MPC judged that a small margin of slack would persist within companies.  But surveys of capacity utilisation rose further in Q3, suggesting less spare capacity (Chart 3.5). It is not clear, however, how much weight to place on these measures in assessing the economy’s longer-term supply capacity.  Companies may have shorter-term notions of capacity in mind when responding to such surveys, ignoring, for example, mothballed capacity, which may require some spending to bring back into use.  Furthermore, companies’ interpretation of a normal level of capacity utilisation may have altered over time, as weak demand has persisted.  Companies’ hiring decisions are another indicator of how productivity is evolving.  Employment growth moderated in the first half of 2013 relative to the particularly strong rates observed last year (Table 3.B).  But unexpectedly strong output growth in Q2 and Q3 has been associated with greater rises in whole-economy employment than expected in H2 so far, driven by permanent and full-time employment within the private sector.

Survey indicators have been moved forward one quarter.  28 Inflation Report  November 2013 Taken together, data on output and employment in Q3 suggest a further rise in productivity, albeit at a slower rate than in Q2. Although both point to robust growth, output expectations from business surveys have picked up more strongly than equivalent employment balances for Q4, suggesting a further rise in productivity.  The relationship between surveys and official data on productivity growth has not, however, been particularly stable (Chart 3.6).  Looking further ahead, contacts of the Bank’s Agents suggest that companies expecting stronger demand also anticipate hiring more people over the coming twelve months (Chart 3.7).   One reason that companies may have increased hiring is if  they remain nervous about the durability of the recovery. Although uncertainty appears to be receding, companies may  still put off the longer-term investment required to create more capacity, instead relying on increasing staff numbers to meet higher demand.  Based on evidence available, it is too soon to draw firm conclusions about the likely path of productivity.  The MPC continues to judge that productivity will pick up as demand recovers, slowing the speed at which unemployment falls.  3.3 Slack in the labour market Continued employment growth has been associated with a further fall in unemployment.  The three-month LFS unemployment rate — the measure referenced in the MPC’s policy guidance — was 7.7% in the three months to August.  This was down from 7.8% in Q2, and below the central expectation at the time of the August Report.  The claimant count, which is a more timely indicator, fell to 4% in September, its lowest rate since January 2009 (Table 3.C).  Bank staff’s near-term projection for the headline unemployment rate is 7.7% for Q3 and 7.6% for Q4 (Chart 3.8), a little lower than expected at the time of the August Report.  The one-month unemployment rate, which has a smaller sample size and is more volatile than the headline measure, rose to 8% in August (see the box on page 29). Changes in labour force participation — the number of people in work or actively seeking employment — can have a significant impact on the unemployment rate.  Previous recessions were associated with falls in the participation rate, as high unemployment discouraged people from looking for work.  This has not happened to the same extent in this downturn.  Instead, the participation rate has been steady, despite downward pressure from a rise in the proportion of the population close to normal retirement age.  In part, that reflects people choosing to stay in employment or seek work in response to the recent squeeze on household incomes.  And changes to government benefits in recent years have encouraged more people to look for work.(1) In line with the MPC’s judgement in the August Report, Chart 3.8 Bank staff projection for the near-term headline LFS unemployment rate(a) 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0 8.5 9.0 Jan.

(1) Developments in the participation rate since the recession are discussed in more detail in the box on page 27 of the May 2013 Report.   Section 3 Output and supply 29 the participation rate remained broadly stable in the three months to August. Alongside the steady participation rate, average hours worked have been robust (Chart 3.9).  This in part reflects the shift from public to private sector employment, where hours worked tend to be higher.  It also may reflect an increase in the number of hours people want to work on average.  For example, the proportion of the workforce working part-time but wishing to work full-time has approximately doubled to just under 5% since 2007 (Table 3.C).  More generally, many employees say that they would like to work longer hours than they currently do.  As a result, average hours will probably continue to rise, as companies respond to improved demand by increasing the hours of their existing staff.  Consequently, higher labour demand may feed through to unemployment more gradually than otherwise.  The one-month unemployment measure The MPC policy guidance references the headline LFS unemployment measure.  The ONS also produces a  one-month measure, not designated as a National Statistic, which averages to the three-month measure.(1) This box explains why the one-month data are volatile and why  they provide a limited signal about developments in the headline measure. The headline three-month measure is based on a survey of around 45,000 households.  Each household in the survey is only interviewed once every three months, meaning that the single-month data are based on a smaller sample of around 15,000 households.  So the households interviewed in August 2012 (the first blue diamond in Chart A), for example, are completely different to those interviewed in the preceeding months (the first green and orange diamonds).   The 15,000-strong monthly sample also changes over time.   In particular, each monthly panel is made up of five cohorts. Each time the monthly panel is interviewed, one cohort  leaves and a new cohort of households enters.  That means that the panel of households interviewed in August 2012 and November 2012 will be very similar (80% of the panel will be the same) but by August 2013, only 20% of the August 2012 panel will remain.   In general, the bigger the sample of any survey, the more  likely it is to be representative of the population, although weighting methods can be used to correct for some likely biases.  For the LFS survey, the monthly sample is relatively small, and the weighting methodology applied to the  one-month series is less robust than that used in the headline data.  These factors mean that the monthly profile can be  very sensitive to the characteristics of the households sampled.  In particular, some cohorts exhibit notably higher  or lower-than-average unemployment rates, and, until these households drop out of the sample, these single-month unemployment rates are likely to be outliers from the  three-month average.  That effect can be seen in the most recent data.  The cohort that entered the sample in March 2013 appears to have had a very low unemployment rate — that is why the March and June data, shown in the most recent green diamonds — are much lower than the headline data.  But that does not necessarily presage sharp falls in the headline data. Chart A LFS unemployment rates 7.0 7.2 7.4 7.6 7.8 8.0 8.2 8.4 June Sep. Dec. Mar.

The near-term outlook for inflation is lower than expected three months ago, and inflation is likely to fall a little further during 2014.  The path of inflation will be influenced by the evolution of global and import prices (Section 4.2), labour costs (Section 4.3), and inflation expectations (see the box on pages 34–35). 4.1 Consumer prices CPI inflation fell from 2.9% in June to 2.2% in October (Chart 4.1), 0.6 percentage points lower than expected at the time of the August Report.  That unexpectedly large fall reflects both recent broad-based weakness in goods and services price inflation, together with a number of specific factors including: the impact of recent falls in oil prices on petrol prices;  utility price increases occurring later than expected;  and a smaller contribution from university tuition fees this year. University tuition fees continue to add to CPI inflation, as the increase in fees that first took effect in 2012 affected a second cohort of students from October.  The exact contribution of fees from year to year depends on the size and composition of the student body, as well as on the extent to which other fees — such as those for part-time courses — rise;  the contribution of education fell from 0.4 percentage points in September to 0.2 percentage points in October.  More generally, administered and regulated prices continue to make an unusually large contribution to CPI inflation, as do past rises in import prices (Section 4.2).(1) The near-term outlook for CPI inflation is lower than three months ago, reflecting the impact of unexpectedly low outturns.  That is despite larger-than-anticipated price rises by energy companies (Table 4.A);  four of the six major suppliers have announced price rises of 9% on average this autumn.  The MPC’s projections assume that the other two major suppliers 4 Costs and prices CPI inflation fell to 2.2% in October from 2.9% in June.  Inflation is expected to remain around this level in the near term despite larger increases in utility prices than anticipated.  Underlying wage growth remains weak.  Companies’ margins still appear squeezed.  Medium-term inflation expectations remain consistent with meeting the 2% target.

(b) Goods and services excluding fuels deflator, excluding the impact of MTIC fraud. will raise domestic energy prices by a similar amount by early 2014.  In total, that suggests that price rises will be around 3 percentage points greater than expected at the time of the August Report, raising inflation by 0.15 percentage points more than assumed.  Once those price rises have come into effect, the contribution of electricity, gas and other fuels to CPI will be around 0.4 percentage points, similar to its contribution over the past two years (Chart 4.2) but substantially above the contribution seen in the decade prior to the crisis.  The contribution could fall back temporarily in the very near term, however, reflecting the relative timing of price rises this year and last. Utility prices are determined by a number of factors, including commodity prices (Section 4.2), the sterling exchange rate (Section 1) and suppliers’ non-energy costs, such as the amount they have to pay towards the maintenance of distribution networks.  The MPC’s projections maintain the assumption of increases in utility prices of 6% in each of the next three years, predominantly reflecting these non-energy costs. Overall, CPI inflation is projected to remain around its current level of 2.2% in the near term (Chart 4.1) and fall back a little further during 2014, aided by the recent appreciation of sterling (Section 5). 4.2 Global and import prices Energy prices Energy costs have had a substantial impact on consumer prices in recent years, and will continue to be an important influence on inflation.  Energy prices affect CPI inflation directly, through fuel prices and household energy bills, and indirectly, through businesses’ costs.  Gas futures prices, a key influence on domestic energy bills (Section 4.1), have fallen slightly since the August Report (Chart 4.3).  Oil futures prices in US dollar terms were slightly higher, but spot prices were a touch lower.  In sterling terms, both spot and futures prices were lower than at the time of the August Report (Chart 4.3), reflecting the rise in the sterling-dollar exchange rate. Non-energy commodity prices Agricultural commodity prices fell during the first half of 2013 in anticipation of a bumper global harvest.  As that materialised, prices stabilised and have been broadly flat since the August Report.  Industrial metals prices have picked up by around 3% since the August Report, but remain around 30% below their 2011 peak, reflecting lower demand from emerging economies (Section 2). Non-energy import prices Import prices reflect both foreign export prices and the sterling exchange rate.  Sterling’s depreciation in 2007–08 led to a  32 Inflation Report  November 2013 Chart 4.5 UK non-energy import prices and contribution of import-intensive components to CPI inflation Contribution of   import-intensive   components to   CPI inﬂation(b)   (right-hand scale)    Import price deﬂator(a)   (left-hand scale)    4 2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 1.0 0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 2003 05 09 11 Per cent  Percentage change on a year earlier               + – + – 07 13 Sources:  ONS and Bank calculations.

(e) Average over the past twelve months, based on monthly data. sharp increase in import prices (Chart 4.4).  And over 2010–11, large increases in foreign export prices caused further rises in import costs.  Over time, higher import prices will tend to be passed through into higher shop prices.  But the timing of that pass-through is uncertain.  The prices of some items, such as fresh food, tend to react quickly to changes in the exchange rate;  prices of some other items will change only slowly, for example, if it takes time for import costs to get passed through their supply chains.  More generally, the dynamics of exchange rate pass-through depend on broader macroeconomic conditions.   One way of judging the impact of higher import prices is to look at the contribution to inflation of the more import-intensive CPI components.  This contribution rose sharply following the 2007–08 depreciation, and has subsequently remained elevated (Chart 4.5).  That contrasts with other, less import-intensive, components of the CPI basket, where inflation rates are typically not elevated compared with their pre-2007 norms.  It therefore suggests a significant role for import prices in the above-target CPI outturns that have characterised the post-crisis period.   Overall, estimates by Bank staff suggest that import prices continued to contribute materially to CPI inflation in Q3.  That reflects the persistent effect of past rises in import prices, as well as the depreciation of sterling at the start of 2013 (Chart 4.4).  The 3.3% rise in sterling since the August Report has largely reversed that depreciation.  Together with the easing in world export price inflation over the past year, that means the contribution to CPI inflation from import prices is likely to fade over the next year or so (Section 5). 4.3 Labour costs, company profits and wage and price-setting behaviour The path of inflation depends on companies’ pricing behaviour, which will reflect developments in their costs, including commodity and other import prices as well as labour costs. The path of inflation also depends on both companies’ and households’ inflation expectations.  Labour costs Average weekly earnings (AWE) growth was volatile in 2013 H1, rising from 0.1% in Q1 to 2.8% in Q2 (Table 4.B). That largely reflected some people taking advantage of the reduction in the top rate of UK income tax in April 2013, and deferring bonus payments and earnings they would have received in 2013 Q1.  Averaging across H1, annual private sector regular pay growth was 1%.  Regular pay grew by 1.2% in the three months to August, well below the pre-recession average growth rate of around 4%.

Central government and local authority compensation have been seasonally adjusted by Bank staff. The extent to which wage growth picks up as demand recovers depends in part on the causes of the past weakness in wages. Real product wages — a measure of wages relative to the prices that companies charge for their output — generally grow broadly in line with productivity (Chart 4.6).  So it is likely that wage growth will recover once productivity growth does.  But companies may wait until the recovery is entrenched before awarding higher pay rises.  Continuing labour market slack may also limit the extent to which wage growth picks up (Chart 4.6).  Nominal wages will also depend on inflation expectations.  If households expect higher inflation they may try to bid for larger pay rises.  And companies may be more inclined to agree to higher pay awards if they think that these can be recouped through higher prices.  But medium-term inflation expectations remain sufficiently well anchored. There are few signs of wage pressures increasing in the near term.  For example, companies responding to the CBI surveys, on average, expect to raise employees’ wages at a broadly similar rate to that seen over the past two years (Chart 4.7). In October the KPMG/REC permanent salaries index, however, rose at its fastest rate since December 2007, pointing to some upward pressure on wages.  Overall, the MPC’s projections are consistent with subdued four-quarter regular pay growth of around 1% on average in 2013 H2 (Section 5). The measure of labour costs that has most bearing on companies’ pricing decisions is the cost of each unit of output produced — the unit labour cost.  The erratic pattern of earnings growth has translated into volatility in quarterly unit labour cost growth, which fell in Q1 and picked up sharply in Q2.  Looking through this volatility, annual unit labour cost growth was close to its pre-crisis average (Chart 4.8).  The MPC expects unit labour costs to decline in Q3 (Section 5). Company profits and business pricing intentions In aggregate, companies’ profit margins have been squeezed since the financial crisis.  The private sector profit share fell in Q2, and remains below its pre-recession average (Chart 4.9). But the evolution of profit margins will have varied across companies and sectors.  According to contacts of the Bank’s Agents, export-facing companies were able to increase their profit margins more than domestic-facing companies after sterling’s depreciation in 2007–08 (Chart 4.10).(1) But over the past year, both export-facing and domestic-facing companies report similar changes. Companies’ profitability may need to rise to deliver sufficiently attractive returns to investors.  Some of the increase in margins could occur through a reallocation of resources across companies, from less to more profitable businesses.  But it (1) For more on company visit scores, see Copple et al (2013), ‘The Agents’ company visit scores’, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Vol. 53, No. 1, pages 59–67.  34 Inflation Report  November 2013 Monitoring inflation expectations In August, the MPC set out its policy guidance, linking Bank Rate and asset sales to an unemployment threshold of 7%.  This guidance will cease to hold if any of three knockouts are breached.  One of these knockouts relates to whether medium-term expectations remain sufficiently well anchored. The MPC has three main metrics for monitoring the risks to inflation expectations:  the level of inflation expectations relative to the target;  uncertainty about inflation;  and the sensitivity of expectations to unexpected economic developments.  A box on pages 36–37 of the August Report concluded that the level of inflation expectations was consistent with the 2% target and uncertainty about the inflation outlook had not increased, although there was tentative evidence that expectations derived from financial markets had been more sensitive to news about the economy over the previous year than they had been before the financial crisis.  This box shows that there has been little recent evidence to alter these conclusions.  Overall, the MPC judges that medium-term inflation expectations remain sufficiently well anchored. The level of inflation expectations Since Q2, several indicators of households’ and companies’ inflation expectations one year and five to ten years ahead have picked up, but those at the two and three-year horizon have been broadly stable (Table 1).  Most household measures remain close to past averages, with the exception of YouGov/Citigroup, which saw very sharp rises in October in both the one year and five to ten year measures (Table 1).  It is possible that these rises reflect households’ response to announcements of higher utility prices:  the survey was carried out around the time that several companies announced higher prices (Section 4.1).  Although such news should not directly affect expectations beyond the near term, similar announcements in the past were also associated with rises in the five to ten year ahead measure.  The majority of these proved short-lived (Chart A).  The MPC will continue to monitor these data closely. Indicators of inflation expectations derived from financial instruments that reference RPI inflation — such as inflation swaps — have changed little since the August Report, although some remain slightly higher than their post-crisis average. These indicators will reflect not only expected CPI inflation, but also market participants’ views about the future wedge between RPI and CPI, together with a risk premium to compensate for uncertainty about future inflation.  Bank staff estimate the long-run RPI-CPI wedge to be around 1.3 percentage points, similar to the Office for Budget Responsibility’s estimate of 1.3 to 1.5 percentage points.(1) Discussions with market contacts suggest that their estimates of the long-run wedge are a little lower. Uncertainty Market-based measures of uncertainty about expected inflation have fallen a little over the past three months.  But they remain at a higher level than in 2008. Sensitivity to news There remains tentative evidence that inflation expectations derived from financial markets have been more sensitive to news than a few years ago.  One way of assessing that sensitivity is to examine how these measures change in response to unexpected movements in CPI inflation on the day of publication. The diamonds in Chart B show the change in expected inflation at different horizons following CPI data releases Table 1 Indicators of inflation expectations(a) Per cent 2000 (or start of series) Averages 2011 2012 2013 to 2007 since averages(b) 2008 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4(c) One year ahead inflation expectations Households(d) Bank/NOP  2.3 3.4 4.1 3.5 3.6 3.6 3.2 n.a.

Section 4 Costs and prices 35 between October 2012 and September 2013, relative to the average changes in response to CPI news between 2004 and 2007.  Over the past twelve months, inflation expectations appear to have been a little more responsive to CPI data news at the six to ten-year horizon than they were between 2004 and 2007 (Chart B).  This could indicate an increase in the risks to inflation expectations, if, for example, market participants believe that the MPC has become more tolerant of deviations of inflation from the 2% target.  But the change in responsiveness of inflation expectations to CPI news over the past year is estimated from a small sample, especially since not all CPI releases contained news.  And the observed changes may reflect market factors rather than inflation expectations. For example, it is not clear why inflation expectations at longer horizons should be more responsive to CPI news than at shorter ones. 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Estimated average change in responsiveness (percentage points)     Horizon of instantaneous forward inﬂation rate (years)  + – Sources:  Bloomberg, ONS and Bank calculations.

The rate at which companies raise prices partly depends on their inflation expectations.  For example, if businesses expect stronger overall inflation, and higher price rises by their competitors as a result, they may be more inclined to make larger price increases themselves.  Companies’ near-term expectations for the change in their own prices, and prices in their industry more generally, have been broadly stable over the past year (Chart 4.7). Inflation expectations Some measures of household inflation expectations have picked up, possibly in response to imminent utility price increases, and so may prove temporary.  Measures of medium-term expectations derived from financial markets and professional forecasters were little changed, although some were slightly higher than their post-crisis average.  Overall, as discussed in a box on pages 34–35, the MPC judges that medium-term inflation expectations remain sufficiently well anchored, and that this price stability knockout has not been breached.

The recent upswing in growth seems set to be sustained as the lifting of uncertainty and thawing of credit conditions start to unlock pent-up demand.  However, the brightening outlook follows the most prolonged downturn on record.  So it is likely to be some time before slack in the economy is materially eroded.      CPI inflation fell to 2.2% in October and is expected to fall further as the impetus from import prices fades.  A gradual rise in productivity growth and a persistent margin of spare capacity should help to contain domestic cost pressures.  Inflation therefore returns to 2% despite a continuing elevated contribution from domestic energy bills and tuition fees.         9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 2009 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Percentage increases in output on a year earlier ONS data Projection Bank estimates of past growth + – The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for GDP growth.  It has been conditioned on the assumption that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remains at £375 billion throughout the forecast period.  To the left of the vertical dashed line, the distribution reflects the likelihood of revisions to the data over the past; to the right, it reflects uncertainty over the evolution of GDP growth in the future.  If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that the mature estimate of GDP growth would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of those occasions.  The fan chart is constructed so that outturns are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter green areas on 30 occasions.  In any particular quarter of the forecast period, GDP growth is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fan on 90 out of 100 occasions.  And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions GDP growth can fall anywhere outside the green area of the fan chart.  Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey background.  See the box on page 39 of the November 2007 Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.   Chart 5.1 GDP projection based on market interest rate expectations and £375 billion asset purchases The United Kingdom is experiencing its strongest period of growth in five years.  Nonetheless, the level of output remains 2.5% lower than in early 2008, and the number of unemployed nearly one million higher, reflecting the  long-lasting legacy of the financial crisis.  Despite its recent fall, CPI inflation is still above the 2% target.  That is in part due to the lingering effect of past import price rises, as well  as to a continuing impetus from domestic energy bills and tuition fees.   The MPC’s latest projection for four-quarter GDP growth is shown in Chart 5.1.  The profile in Chart 5.1 is conditioned on the assumption that Bank Rate rises in line with a path implied by market yields, rather than the constant rate assumption used three months ago.  That does not reflect the Committee’s view of the most likely path of Bank Rate;  it is simply a reversion to the convention of using the market curve now that financial markets have been able to absorb the policy guidance provided in August.  In the near term, growth is set to pick up further, as dissipating uncertainty and thawing credit conditions help the recovery to gain momentum.  Growth slows a little thereafter as some of that initial boost moderates.  The rise in Bank Rate implied by the market curve dampens growth over the forecast period.  Chart 5.2 sets out the latest projection for CPI inflation. Inflation is projected to fall a little further as the impetus from past rises in import prices fades, and as productivity growth, together with a persistent margin of spare capacity, attenuates domestic price pressures.  Compared with August (Chart 5.3), the near-term path for inflation is lower, reflecting both the unexpectedly low outturns and the recent appreciation of sterling.  Medium-term inflationary pressures are little changed;  as in August, the risks to inflation are broadly  Section 5 Prospects for inflation 37 balanced around the target two to three years ahead  (Chart 5.4).   5.1 Key judgements and risks The Committee’s projections are underpinned by four judgements, set out below.  Risks surround these judgements, and Table 5.A on page 38 provides a range of indicators for monitoring them in the near term.  Sections 1 to 4 of the Report summarise developments in the corresponding indicators set out three months ago.   Key Judgement 1:  global growth strengthens gradually, driven by the advanced economies Three months ago the Committee’s view was that international policy initiatives would facilitate a sustained, albeit gradual, global recovery.  Since then overall world demand has turned out broadly as expected, although there has been some news in its composition (see Table 2.A on  page 16).  In particular, activity in the euro area has been a little stronger than expected, while developments in some emerging economies have been less favourable.  The Committee’s latest projections imply a gentle strengthening of global growth, but only to around its long-run average of 3% or so.  That strengthening is largely driven by the advanced economies, as they gradually cast off the legacy of the financial crisis.  The contribution to global growth from the emerging economies is assumed to be broadly stable.   In the euro area, some countries continue to face considerable challenges in improving competitiveness and reducing indebtedness.  That is the main reason for the sluggish  2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 2009 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Percentage increase in prices on a year earlier     + – Chart 5.2 CPI inflation projection based on market interest rate expectations and £375 billion asset purchases 2009 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Percentage increase in prices on a year earlier 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 + – Chart 5.3 CPI inflation projection in August based on constant nominal interest rates at 0.5% and £375 billion asset purchases Charts 5.2 and 5.3 depict the probability of various outcomes for CPI inflation in the future.  They have been conditioned on the assumption that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remains at £375 billion throughout the forecast period.  If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that inflation in any particular quarter would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of those occasions.  The fan charts are constructed so that outturns of inflation are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter red areas on 30 occasions.  In any particular quarter of the forecast period, inflation is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fans on 90 out of 100 occasions.  And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions inflation can fall anywhere outside the red area of the fan chart. Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey background.  See the box on pages 48–49 of the May 2002 Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.

The 5 percentage points width of the swathes reflects the fact that there is uncertainty about the precise probability in any given quarter, but they should not be interpreted as confidence intervals.   Chart 5.4 Probability that inflation will be above  the target  38 Inflation Report  November 2013 The Committee’s projections are underpinned by four key judgements.  Risks surround all of these, and the MPC will monitor a broad range of indicators to assess the degree to which the risks are crystallising.  The table below provides guidance on the likely path for the indicators if the judgements underlying the MPC’s central view evolve as expected.     Table 5.A Monitoring risks to the Committee’s key judgements Key judgement Likely developments in late 2013/2014 H1 if judgements evolve as expected 1:  global growth strengthens gradually, driven by the advanced economies • Quarterly euro-area GDP growth averaging around a quarter of a percentage point in 2013 H2 and 2014 H1.  • Quarterly US GDP growth to average around, or a little above, 0.5% in 2013 H2 and 2014 H1. • Indicators of activity consistent with four-quarter growth of around 7.5% in China, and around 4% in the other emerging economies, in 2013 H2 and 2014 H1. • Indicators of international bank funding costs broadly stable. 2:  the domestic recovery becomes increasingly entrenched as the headwinds to demand lessen • Quarterly consumer spending growth of around 0.5%, or a little stronger, in 2013 H2 and 2014 H1. • Indicators of business investment consistent with average growth rates of around, or a little above, 2% a quarter in 2013 H2 and 2014 H1;  the MPC continues to put relatively little weight on the recent weakness suggested by the official data. • Further modest declines in the cost of credit to some households and smaller companies.  Further increases in credit availability. • The pace of decline in four-quarter PNFC net lending continues to ease in 2013 Q4, before returning to growth from 2014 Q1 onwards. • A rise in mortgage approvals for home purchase to around 70,000 a month in 2013 Q4, and around 90,000 in 2014 Q2. • Housing investment growth to remain strong over the next year, averaging around 5% per quarter. 3:  slack in the economy is eroded only gradually, despite the recovery in demand • Headline LFS unemployment rate to reach 7.5% by early 2014. • Indicators of spare capacity consistent with no material intensification of capacity pressures. • Average hours continuing to rise gently in 2013 H2 and 2014 H1. • Four-quarter growth in labour productivity per hour to rise to above 1% by early 2014.   • The labour market participation rate to remain broadly stable. 4:  inflation returns to the target as the impetus from import prices abates, and a gradual rise in productivity growth attenuates domestic price pressures • Medium-term indicators of household and financial market inflation expectations continuing to be consistent with the 2% target (see the box on pages 34–35). • Headline four-quarter AWE growth to be around 1% on average in 2013 H2, rising a little thereafter. • Declining unit labour costs in Q3, followed by gradually rising quarterly growth to around 0.5% by mid-2014. • Sterling ERI, domestic energy bills and commodity prices to evolve in line with the conditioning assumptions (see the box on page 42). euro-area growth implicit in the Committee’s projections;  in the central view, growth is assumed to pick up gradually to around 1.5% by the end of the forecast period, somewhat below its historical average.  This could prove to be too pessimistic, say if dissipating uncertainty provides a larger uplift to spending growth in the core euro-area countries.  Set against that is the possibility that the continuing adjustment in the periphery acts as a greater drag on growth.  There are also risks in both directions from the planned asset quality review and bank stress tests.  As in previous Reports, the Committee’s fan charts exclude extreme outturns related to disorderly  euro-area adjustment.   Section 5 Prospects for inflation 39 In the United States, the highly stimulative stance of monetary policy combined with a reduced fiscal drag should help to support a strengthening of the recovery.  But there are risks in both directions around the central view that US growth will return to about its long-term average of 3% by the end of the forecast period.  Downside risks include renewed fiscal impasse;  upside risks include a greater degree of private sector momentum.  US developments could pose wider risks to the world outlook. In particular, international capital flows to and from some emerging economies have recently exhibited heightened sensitivity to expectations of US monetary policy.  In the Committee’s central projection, emerging economies that are grappling with weak external positions and elevated domestic inflation — such as Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey — are assumed to avoid serious disruption.  But there are clear downside risks.  And while direct trade links with the United Kingdom are relatively small, disorderly outcomes in these economies could still have a material impact, both through the indirect effects of trade with third parties, and through financial linkages.    Given this global backdrop, the MPC’s central view assumes that UK exports recover alongside world demand, the recent modest appreciation in sterling notwithstanding.  In the central view, the United Kingdom’s share of world trade is assumed to revert to its declining pre-crisis trend.  The degree to which exporters will be able to capitalise on the world recovery remains unclear, however.  In part, the UK trade share depends upon the evolution of sterling.  But it also depends upon the scope for services to support export growth — pronounced weakness in services exports, particularly in financial services, in part explains the United Kingdom’s unexpectedly weak export performance in the post-crisis period (see the box on pages 47–49).  Key Judgement 2:  the domestic recovery becomes increasingly entrenched as the headwinds to demand lessen  The UK recovery is gaining traction.  Indicators of domestic activity have been stronger over the past three months  than anticipated, particularly so in the housing market  (see Tables 1.A and 2.A on pages 9 and 16 respectively).  That positive momentum looks set to be maintained, with dissipating uncertainty and thawing credit conditions starting to unlock pent-up demand.  But the long-lasting legacy of the financial crisis, and the associated need for balance sheet repair in the private and public sectors, is still likely to cast a shadow over domestic spending.  For example, although consumer spending growth is sustained in the central view, it is projected to be only around, or a little above, 0.5% a quarter; that is some way below its historical average of 0.9%.  And the anticipated revival in business spending growth is concentrated in the latter part of the forecast period.    40 Inflation Report  November 2013 One downside risk is that continuing balance sheet repair drags on the recovery to a greater extent than assumed, such that the recent lift to demand from reduced uncertainty and improved credit conditions proves short-lived.  For some households in particular, concerns about excessive indebtedness, or about prospects for future income, may mean that they are not prepared to reduce their savings rates to the degree implied by the central view.  Set against that, however, is the possibility that domestic demand growth revives more quickly than anticipated, as a self-reinforcing dynamic develops whereby increased spending drives improvements  in household and business optimism about incomes, and  vice versa.  Such a feedback loop could manifest itself in a variety of ways:  in a faster rise in consumer spending;  in an earlier resurgence in business investment;  or in stronger activity in the housing market.   The Committee’s central view assumes that the revival in housing activity boosts demand through much of the forecast period, and particularly so in the next 18 months.  That largely comes through housing investment — the building of new homes, the improvement of existing homes, and services related to property transactions such as conveyancing — which contributes around 1 percentage point to four-quarter  GDP growth over the next year or so.  The direct link from house prices and housing activity to consumer spending is assumed to be quite modest in the central view, reflecting empirical evidence (see the box on pages 20–21). Uncertainties include the extent to which shortages of labour and materials act as a brake on housing investment.  More generally, the housing market may provide a greater boost to consumer demand, particularly if a broader feedback loop emerges between confidence and spending.  The central view may also understate the scope for rising property prices to ease collateral constraints for smaller companies.  And there is uncertainty about the outlook for house prices more generally. Surveys suggest that the recent rate of increase in house prices will continue in the near term.  In the longer run, property prices seem likely to rise broadly in line with nominal incomes, although the dynamics of future house price inflation are unclear.   In the near term, an unexpectedly strong housing market revival represents an upside risk to the growth projection. However, concerns about stability could emerge if stronger activity were accompanied by substantial and rapid increases in house prices and leverage.  For that reason, the Bank remains vigilant to the potential for emerging vulnerabilities associated with the property market.  Any potential risks to financial stability emanating from the property market would in the first instance be addressed by the Financial Policy Committee, working with the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.  Such risks will be discussed in the forthcoming November 2013 Financial Stability Report.   Section 5 Prospects for inflation 41 Key Judgement 3:  slack in the economy is eroded only gradually, despite the recovery in demand The post-crisis period has been marked by persistent weakness in productivity, and the scope for productivity to pick up alongside the recovery in demand remains the key question for the Committee.  In August, the central projection assumed that the upswing in demand was largely matched by an increase in supply, with unemployment projected to fall only gradually.  Since then, productivity has risen broadly as expected (see Table 3.A on page 25).  But unemployment has fallen faster than anticipated, reflecting unexpectedly strong output growth.    There is little in the recent data to alter materially the Committee’s view about the prospects for productivity.  The causes of the past weakness in productivity remain uncertain, and several factors may have been at work.  Some of these are likely to recede as demand recovers — for example, labour productivity will have been depressed by the need for some companies to maintain minimum staffing levels during the downturn, and by a desire to retain skills and expertise (a form of labour hoarding).  But other influences will dissipate only gradually.  For example, the fragility of the banking sector is thought to have contributed to inefficiencies in the allocation of capital across companies and sectors, and this may take time to resolve.   The outlook for productivity depends on the balance between the ephemeral impediments to productivity growth, and the more persistent ones.  In the central view that balance is such that productivity growth rises gradually to around its pre-crisis rate by the end of the forecast period, although there are sizable risks in both directions.  The magnitude of the pickup in productivity will determine the eventual strength and durability of the recovery.  It will also be a central influence on the margin of slack:  the faster the rate of productivity growth, the greater the scope for the economy to expand without generating inflationary pressure.     In the central view, with productivity growth likely to rise as the recovery takes hold, a margin of slack is assumed to persist throughout the forecast period.  In the labour market, slack will take time to erode as companies, in aggregate, are assumed to work existing resources more intensively before stepping up hiring.  Persistent slack in the labour market also reflects the assumptions that average hours worked will continue to drift up, in contrast to their pre-crisis trend, and that the participation rate remains broadly stable.  Both these assumptions are subject to considerable uncertainty.   Key Judgement 4:  inflation returns to the target as the impetus from import prices abates, and as a gradual rise in productivity growth attenuates domestic price pressures  CPI inflation has been above the 2% target for most of the post-crisis period, primarily reflecting the impetus from past  42 Inflation Report  November 2013 Forecast conditioning assumptions As a benchmark assumption, the projections for CPI inflation and GDP growth described in Charts 5.2 and 5.1 are conditioned on a path for Bank Rate implied by market interest rates (Table 1).  In the period leading up to the MPC’s November decision, the path implied by forward market interest rates was for Bank Rate not to rise above 0.5%, the current level of Bank Rate, until early 2015, and to rise to around 1.7% by 2016 Q4.  The path for Bank Rate at the  time of the November Report was, on average, around  0.3 percentage points higher than that assumed in the  August Report, which was conditioned on an assumption that Bank Rate remained at 0.5% throughout the forecast period.  The November projections are conditioned on an assumption that the total stock of asset purchases financed by the creation of central bank reserves remains at £375 billion throughout the forecast period, the same total scale of purchases assumed in the August projections. The starting point for sterling’s effective exchange rate index (ERI) in the MPC’s projections was 82.6, the average for the fifteen working days to 6 November.  That was 3.3% above the starting point for the August projections.  Under the MPC’s usual convention,(1) the exchange rate is broadly stable, and is higher throughout the forecast period than was assumed in August. The starting point for UK equity prices in the MPC’s projections was 3575 — the average of the FTSE All-Share for the fifteen working days to 6 November.  That was 2.4% above the starting point for the August projection. Energy prices are assumed to evolve broadly in line with the paths implied by futures markets over the forecast period. Average Brent oil futures prices for the next three years were around 2% higher (in US dollar terms) than at the time of the August Report.  Based on announcements by major energy suppliers, domestic energy prices are expected to rise by an average of around 9% by 2014 Q1.  Wholesale gas futures prices were around 2% lower over the forecast period than at the time of the August Report.  Major energy suppliers, however, anticipate that their non-energy costs — which were cited by most as part of the reason for the most recent price rises — will continue to increase in coming years.  The central projection is therefore conditioned on a benchmark assumption of increases in domestic gas and electricity prices averaging 6% each year. In line with the usual convention, the Committee’s projections are conditioned on the Government’s tax and spending plans. For this forecast, that means the plans set out in the  2013 March Budget, supplemented by the Office for Budget Responsibility’s associated Economic and Fiscal Outlook.  They also take account of the transfers of gilt coupons received by the Asset Purchase Facility, net of interest costs and other expenses, to the Exchequer.  The subsequent use of these cash flows to pay down government debt will have an effect similar to the MPC purchasing gilts of the same value.  The Committee’s projections are also conditioned on the recommendations of the Financial Policy Committee (as set out in the Record of its September meeting);  and on the current regulatory plans of the Prudential Regulation Authority, including the transition to the Basel III regulatory standard. (1) The convention is that the sterling exchange rate follows a path which is half way between the starting level of the sterling ERI and a path implied by interest rate differentials. rises in import prices and the unusually large contribution from domestic energy bills and university tuition fees.  In the  August Report inflation was projected to fall back gradually towards the target as higher productivity growth attenuated domestic cost pressures and external price pressures faded. Over the past few months, inflation has fallen back more quickly than anticipated (see Section 4).    A key determinant of companies’ costs, and therefore inflation, is unit labour cost growth — wage growth relative to productivity gains.  Unit labour cost growth has slowed over Table 1 Conditioning path for Bank Rate implied by forward market interest rates(a) Per cent 2013 2014 2015 2016 Q4(b) Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 November 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.5 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 1.0 1.1 1.3 1.5 1.7 (a) The data are fifteen working day averages of one-day forward rates to 6 November 2013.

Section 5 Prospects for inflation 43 the past year, and may turn negative in the near term as growth in productivity outstrips that in wages.  Further ahead, both productivity and wages are likely to pick up, but only at a gradual pace.  Pay pressures are expected to be contained by elevated unemployment:  in the central view, annual average earnings growth only rises to a little above 3%, below typical pre-crisis rates of 4.5% or so.  Among the risks to wages are that companies become more inclined to grant higher pay awards, perhaps reflecting pockets of skill shortages, or broader concerns that continued pressure on real incomes could undermine employees’ morale or efficiency.  That risk may be particularly marked if companies believe that they can recoup higher wage costs through higher prices as the recovery develops.  Prospects for profit margins are another source of uncertainty. Margins have been squeezed since the financial crisis, and may need to rise in the longer term to provide investors with an adequate return.  The Committee’s central view is consistent with a gradual restoration of margins in the consumer sector, where the squeeze has been greatest in recent years.  However, there is uncertainty about the pace, and the extent of, the rise in profitability, as well as the degree to which margin restoration comes through faster price increases rather than slower rises in costs.     Above-target outturns for CPI inflation over the past five years can be largely accounted for by external prices — oil prices have risen sharply, as have the prices of imports, in part reflecting the 2007–08 sterling depreciation.  But these external price pressures have started to fade.  That is expected to continue over the forecast:  the Committee’s projections assume that oil prices follow the gentle downward slope of the futures curve, and that non-oil commodity prices and the sterling ERI are broadly stable (see the box on page 42).  There are uncertainties both about these external prices themselves and about their pass-through into consumer prices.  For example, in the central view, the Committee’s projections assume that only some of the fall in import prices associated with the recent rise in sterling is passed on to the consumer over the forecast period, with the remainder absorbed into company margins.  But there is uncertainty about this assumption.  Moreover, in general, pass-through may  depend on the size and direction of the change in the  exchange rate.  Since the last Report, energy suppliers have announced their intention to increase domestic energy prices by an average  of 9% or so, 3 percentage points higher than assumed by  the Committee in previous Reports, adding a further  0.15 percentage points to the near-term inflation rate.  In the first part of the forecast period, energy bills are now assumed to contribute around 0.4 percentage points to inflation, substantially above the 0.1 percentage point contribution seen in the decade prior to the crisis.

See the footnote to Chart 5.1 for details of the assumptions underlying the projection for GDP growth.  The width of this fan over the past has been calibrated to be consistent with the four-quarter growth fan chart, under the assumption that revisions to quarterly growth are independent of the revisions to previous quarters.  Over the forecast, the mean and modal paths for the level of GDP are consistent with Chart 5.1.  So the skews for the level fan chart have been constructed from the skews in the four-quarter growth fan chart at the one, two and three-year horizons.  This calibration also takes account of the likely path dependency of the economy, where, for example, it is judged that shocks to GDP growth in one quarter will continue to have some effect on GDP growth in successive quarters.  This assumption of path dependency serves to widen the fan chart.

Other administered and regulated prices — such as tuition fees — will also continue to exert upward pressure on inflation.  Uncertainties surround not only the magnitude of future rises in domestic energy bills (and administered and regulated prices more generally), but also their broader impact on inflation.  5.2 The projections for demand, unemployment and inflation GDP  Based on the judgements above, and the risks around them, four-quarter GDP growth is expected to pick up further in the near term as the lifting of uncertainty and the thawing of credit conditions continue to bolster demand growth.  That near-term outlook is a little stronger than three months ago, (Table 5.B), primarily reflecting the increasingly positive tone of recent survey data.  However, output is still more likely than not to remain below its pre-crisis peak until next spring  (Chart 5.5).     Further ahead, the pace of growth is likely to ease back a little in the second and third years of the forecast as some of the initial boost provided by the lifting of uncertainty and easing of credit conditions moderates.  By the end of 2015, GDP growth is likely to be broadly the same as that projected in August (Chart 5.6).  The November GDP projection in Chart 5.1 assumes that Bank Rate evolves in line with the market curve, compared with the assumption of constant Bank Rate used three months ago.  Chart 5.7 shows the November projection under the alternative conditioning path of constant Bank Rate: the level of GDP is just under 1 percentage point higher by the end of the forecast period than if Bank Rate had followed the market path.(1) There is a range of views on the Committee about the risks to GDP growth.  But, overall, the balance of risks is judged to be to the downside, as in August.  That reflects the continuing challenges facing the euro area, as well as the risk that balance sheet repair proves to be a greater drag on growth in domestic spending.     Unemployment  Chart 5.8 shows the Committee’s latest projections for unemployment.  As the recovery in demand growth is expected to be accompanied by a gradual rise in productivity growth, only a gentle decline in the unemployment rate is in prospect.  A broadly stable participation rate and a modest rise in average hours worked also slow the rate at which labour (1) In the August Report, the MPC’s projections assumed that the marginal impact on growth and inﬂation of the assumed path for Bank Rate came through more quickly than had been the case in previous projections, reﬂecting the impact of its policy guidance on expectations and asset prices.  The same approach has been taken in this Report.  9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 2009 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Percentage increases in output on a year earlier   Projection   Bank estimates of past growth   ONS data   + – See footnote to Chart 5.1.

It has been conditioned on the assumption that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remains at £375 billion throughout the forecast period.  If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that the mature estimate of unemployment would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of those occasions.  The fan chart is constructed so that outturns are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter blue areas on 30 occasions.  In any particular quarter of the forecast period, unemployment is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fan on 90 out of 100 occasions.  And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions unemployment can fall anywhere outside the blue area of the fan chart.  Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey background.  The calibration of this fan chart takes account of the likely path dependency of the economy, where, for example, it is judged that shocks to unemployment in one quarter will continue to have some effect on unemployment in successive quarters.  The fan begins in 2013 Q3, a quarter earlier than the fan for CPI inflation.  That is because Q3 is a staff projection for the unemployment rate, based in part on data for July and August.  The unemployment rate was 7.7% in the three months to August, and is projected to remain at  7.7% in Q3 as a whole.  In the corresponding chart in the August Report, the equivalent quarter (2013 Q2), was included in the solid line, rather than in the fan.   Chart 5.8 Unemployment projection based on market interest rate expectations and £375 billion asset purchases  Section 5 Prospects for inflation 45 market slack is eroded.  The projected decline in the unemployment rate is a little faster than anticipated  three months ago.  This primarily reflects stronger near-term output growth rather than a change of view about the underlying prospects for productivity.  Under the alternative assumption of constant Bank Rate, unemployment is projected to fall a little more quickly (Chart 5.9).  Considerable uncertainty surrounds the outlook for unemployment, in part reflecting uncertainty about productivity.  Unemployment outturns are also sensitive to assumptions about labour market participation and average hours worked.  Small changes can have sizable implications: for example, for a given GDP projection, if four-quarter growth in productivity per hour over the forecast period was  0.25 percentage points lower on average, this would mechanically be associated with a further fall in the unemployment rate of 0.7 percentage points or so.  In part reflecting those uncertainties, the width of the fan chart has been increased a little compared with the August Report.    The risks around the central projection for unemployment are judged to be tilted to the upside, reflecting, as in August, both the balance of risks to demand and the possibility that there is more hidden slack in the economy than implied by the central view.  The Committee’s latest projections, assuming that  Bank Rate rises in line with the market curve, imply around a two-in-five chance that the unemployment rate will have reached the 7% policy threshold by the end of 2014.  The corresponding figures for the end of 2015 and 2016 are around three in five and two in three respectively (Chart 5.10).  CPI inflation Under the assumption that Bank Rate rises in line with market yields, CPI inflation is projected to fall a little further in the near term, and remain around, or a little below, the 2% target thereafter.  The impetus from import prices is assumed to fade and a gradual recovery in productivity growth, together with a persistent margin of spare capacity in the economy, is expected to curb domestic price pressures.  Compared with August, inflation is lower, particularly so in the first half of the forecast period (Table 5.C and Chart 5.11).  That lower profile reflects both the unexpectedly low inflation outturns and the recent appreciation of sterling.   In August, the Committee agreed that its policy guidance would cease to hold either if medium-term inflation expectations were judged to be insufficiently well anchored, or if, in the MPC’s view, inflation was more likely than not to be above 2.5% 18 to 24 months ahead.  Recent developments in inflation expectations are discussed in the box on pages 34–35. And the Committee’s latest projections imply a roughly  one-in-three chance that inflation will be above 2.5% 18 to  24 months ahead (Chart 5.12).  That compares with a figure of around two in five in the August Report.   0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 2013 14 15 16 Probability, per cent November August Q3 Q1 Q3 Q1 Q3 Q1 Q3 The November swathe in this chart is derived from the same distribution as Chart 5.8 and is conditioned on market interest rate expectations;  the August swathe is that shown in Chart 5.11 of the August Report and is conditioned on constant interest rates.  The swathes show the probability that unemployment has reached 7% by each quarter of the forecast period.  The  5 percentage points width of the swathes reflects the fact that there is uncertainty about the precise probability in any given quarter, but it should not be interpreted as a confidence interval.

Chart 5.9 Unemployment projection based on constant nominal interest rates at 0.5% and £375 billion  asset purchases  46 Inflation Report  November 2013 Under the alternative conditioning path of constant Bank Rate, CPI inflation is higher throughout the forecast period, reflecting the more accommodative stance of monetary policy, but only a little above 2% by the end (Chart 5.13).  This reflects the assumption that the additional activity under constant Bank Rate is in part associated with higher productivity, thus moderating its inflationary impact.  The constant rate projection, like the market rate projection, is predicated on inflation expectations remaining anchored.   5.3 The policy decision A recovery appears to have finally taken hold;  even so, a sustained period of strong growth is likely to be needed before slack is materially eroded.  To that end, the Committee indicated in August that it intended to maintain the stance of policy at least until unemployment had reached 7%, provided that it did not entail material risks to price stability or financial stability.   At its November meeting, the Committee noted that the stronger near-term outlook for demand meant that, on the assumption that Bank Rate followed a path implied by market rates, unemployment was likely to fall more quickly than anticipated in August, while CPI inflation looked set to fall back to around the 2% target over the next year or so.  The pace with which unemployment fell back would, however, depend heavily on the extent to which the recovery in demand was accompanied by higher productivity.  The Committee judged that neither of its price stability knockouts had been breached, and noted that the FPC had concluded at its latest meeting that there had been no breach of the financial stability knockout.  Its guidance therefore remained in place. The Committee reiterated that reaching the unemployment threshold would not necessarily trigger an immediate policy response.  Rather the setting of policy at that point would depend on the outlook for inflation relative to the target and on the need to provide continued support to output and employment.  In that regard, the Committee noted that its projections conditioned on the assumption that Bank Rate remained at 0.5% implied that no policy action was taken when the unemployment threshold was reached.  These projections suggested that inflation would be only a little above the target by the end of the forecast period, while growth was projected to be stronger, and unemployment to fall more rapidly, than in the case in which Bank Rate was assumed to rise in line with the market curve. In the light of both the economic outlook and its policy guidance, the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5% and the stock of asset purchases at £375 billion.

Section 5 Prospects for inflation 47 The MPC’s forecasting record A forthcoming Quarterly Bulletin article will present a detailed assessment of the MPC’s forecasting performance.(1) This box, which summarises part of that assessment, looks at how  the economy has evolved relative to the projections in the  August 2010 Inflation Report, which were typical of MPC forecasts around that time.  And it discusses which of the assumptions that underlay that forecast proved to be misplaced.(2) How has the economy evolved relative to the MPC’s key judgements in the August 2010 Report? In August 2010, the MPC expected inflation to fall back, and the UK economy to continue to recover from the 2008/09 recession as the effects of the financial crisis faded.  In particular: • UK trade was expected to benefit from a global recovery and improved competitiveness following the large depreciation of sterling in 2007–08, such that the UK export share would rise; • an easing in credit conditions and uncertainty was thought likely to support domestic demand; • a temporary boost to inflation from import and energy prices was expected to wane; • rising demand was expected to be associated with rising labour productivity;  and • an increase in unemployment was expected to weigh on wages and prices.  Based on those judgements, the MPC’s central projection  was for four-quarter GDP growth to average around 3% from 2010 Q2 to 2013 Q2 and for CPI inflation to fall back to below the 2% target by 2012. In fact, average growth has been closer to 1% (Chart A), leaving the level of GDP in 2013 Q2 almost 7% weaker than expected.  Relative to their shares in GDP, that unexpected weakness was disproportionately accounted for by exports and business investment (Chart B), with consumption also playing a role.  There was, however, a partial offset from lower imports. Despite weaker demand, inflation did not, as expected, fall back towards the target, but picked up sharply, reaching around 5% in 2011 Q3 (Chart C).  That suggests that unexpected developments raised companies’ costs, more than offsetting the effects of weaker demand. The MPC reacted as the outlook worsened by providing more stimulus:  since August 2010, the stock of asset purchases has increased by £175 billion.  In addition, Bank Rate has remained at 0.5% compared with an assumed rise to 2% implied by the market curve at that time.  Were it not for that more stimulative policy stance, it is likely that GDP and inflation, as 8 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 2006 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 Percentage increases in output on a year earlier Latest vintage    of GDP data(a)    Bank estimates in August 2010   of past growth  August 2010    fan chart(b)    Vintage of GDP data    at the time of the    August 2010 Report   + – (a) Revisions, including methodological changes, account for the gap between the red and black lines prior to the vertical dashed line.

The rest of this box examines the underlying drivers of the economy, relative to expectations, as summarised in Table 1. Headwinds to demand more persistent than expected: world demand, credit conditions and uncertainty Since 2010 Q1, exports have grown by just over 10%, compared with an expectation of around 30%.  Around half of that news can be attributed to an unexpectedly weak global recovery, reflecting in part the intensification of sovereign debt concerns and banking sector strains in several euro-area countries in mid-2011.  As a result, UK-weighted world trade is estimated to have grown much less than anticipated (Table 1), with around two thirds of that news coming directly from the  euro area. The remaining news in exports reflects the fall in the share of world trade captured by UK companies since mid-2010;  it had been expected to rise following sterling’s depreciation.  As discussed in previous Reports, although goods exporters seem to have benefited from the depreciation, services exports have fallen relative to world trade, in part reflecting both weaker demand for, and lower supply of, UK financial services.(3) Global developments have also dragged on domestic spending. Weaker external demand is likely to have weighed on  UK companies’ investment.  And the euro-area crisis meant that UK bank funding costs and uncertainty rose again in  mid-2011, rather than falling back as expected.  The euro-area crisis is one reason why, even after recent improvements in funding costs, a weighted average of the spread of household and corporate lending and deposit rates over Bank Rate is only 20 basis points lower than in early 2010, 150 basis points or so higher than expected (Table 1).  Uncertainty has probably also dissipated less rapidly than expected.   Headwinds to demand from world trade, credit conditions and uncertainty are key factors contributing to, though not fully explaining, the unexpected weakness in demand since  mid-2010.  Other things equal, these would have depressed inflation.  The unexpected strength in inflation is therefore likely to reflect adverse cost developments.  Two such developments discussed in previous Reports are rises in import and energy prices, and weak productivity. Unanticipated rises in energy and import prices have pushed up on consumer prices CPI inflation has been boosted since mid-2010 by unexpectedly large rises in energy costs.  That reflects higher regulatory and distribution costs faced by energy suppliers as well as higher oil prices.  Oil prices rose sharply through the latter part of 2010 and first half of 2011, and on average have been 25% above the August 2010 Report conditioning path (Table 1).  Bank staff estimate that unexpected rises in energy prices can account for around half of a percentage point of the unexpected strength in CPI inflation, on average, over the past three years, with the largest impact in 2011 (Table 2).   Other import prices have also played a role (Table 2).  Since 2010 Q1, UK import prices (excluding fuels) have risen around 4% more than expected (Table 1), partly reflecting unanticipated rises in non-oil commodity prices.  Bank staff estimate that news in UK import prices alone is likely to have added around half of a percentage point, on average, to twelve-month CPI inflation over the past three years.  In addition, current estimates suggest that the import intensity of CPI and pass-through to consumer prices have been higher than assumed in August 2010, accounting for a further third of a percentage point of the news in inflation on average.

These higher prices have also weighed on households’ real income and spending growth. Although it is possible to account for higher inflation with these higher imported costs, it is still surprising that  CPI inflation has not been lower.  Had the MPC known that the recovery in demand would falter, it would probably have built in a weaker inflation forecast.  That suggests some other factor has counteracted the impact of weak demand on inflation.  An obvious candidate, although not the only one, is unexpectedly weak productivity. Other factors, including unexpectedly weak productivity, have offset the drag on inflation from weak demand Surprisingly weak demand growth has been associated with weak productivity growth.  In contrast to the above-average growth expected in August 2010 (Table 1), productivity has flatlined since mid-2010, such that the effective supply capacity of UK companies has not grown as expected.  There are several factors that are likely to have borne down on productivity, as discussed in Section 3.(4) Some of the weakness in productivity has probably been directly related to the weakness in demand, so that weak demand has not been associated with much additional downward pressure on inflation.  It is also possible that factors such as impaired credit markets have weighed on productivity growth, for example by impeding the efficient allocation of resources.  These factors could therefore help account for the unexpected resilience of inflation in the face of weak demand.  And they probably also account for some of the unexpected weakness in demand as well:  if companies and households now expect productivity weakness to persist for longer than they did prior to mid-2010 then that may have weighed on spending. In addition to unexpectedly weak productivity growth, other factors could have offset the disinflationary implications of weak demand growth, such as greater inflation persistence. For example, successive rises in inflation through 2010 and 2011 may have led some households and companies to  expect inflation to stay high, despite those rises being driven largely by temporary rises in import and energy prices.  One to three year ahead inflation expectations did rise through 2011, but fell back again thereafter as inflation moderated (see the box on pages 34–35).  The precise relation between inflation expectations measures and actual inflation is, however, uncertain. Conclusion Relative to the August 2010 projection, GDP has been weaker than anticipated, and inflation higher.  That seems to reflect a number of factors:  weaker world growth;  a more pervasive impact of tight credit conditions and uncertainty;  and stronger import and energy prices.  Other factors, such as unexpectedly weak productivity, are also likely to have played a role in offsetting the impact of weak demand growth on inflation.   The key judgements underpinning the MPC’s current projections reflect the experience of the past few years.  In particular, although the MPC’s latest projections incorporate a gradual global recovery, some further easing in credit conditions and a recovery in productivity growth, the MPC now believes that the economy is taking longer to adjust to the repercussions of the financial crisis than was previously expected.  Indeed, in its latest projections, GDP is judged likely to grow at around its historical average rate over the forecast period;  in August 2010, the recovery was assumed to involve a period of above-trend growth.   (1) An enhanced forecast evaluation exercise is one aspect of the Bank’s response to  the ‘Review of the Monetary Policy Committee’s forecasting capability’ by  David Stockton. (2) Given inherent uncertainty in economic forecasting, the MPC considers the whole distribution of possible outcomes when setting policy.  Since 2010, outturns have lain disproportionately in the lower and upper quintiles of those probability distributions at the one-year and two-year horizons.  A fuller analysis of the MPC’s forecast errors in the context of their probability distributions will be included in the forthcoming Quarterly Bulletin article.

This box reports the results of the most recent survey, carried out during October.  On average, respondents expected annual CPI inflation to fall back steadily over the next three years from its current rate to 2.2% (Table 1).  That was similar to average expectations three months ago.  Four-quarter GDP growth was, on average, projected to recover gradually, but to remain below its historical average rate of 2.75% over the next three years (Table 1).  Cumulative growth over the three years was around 1 percentage point higher than three months ago. In November, the survey also asked for expectations for the LFS unemployment rate:  the unemployment rate was expected to fall gradually over the next three years to 6.7% (Table 1). These forecasts assumed on average a slightly tighter monetary stance to those made three months ago.  On average, Bank Rate was expected to be a touch higher.  The stock of asset purchases financed by the issuance of central bank reserves was, on average, expected to be £25 billion lower by the three-year horizon.  The sterling ERI was expected to be 2% higher on average at the one-year horizon, but similar in years two and three. The Bank also asks forecasters for their assessment of the risks around their central projections for CPI inflation, GDP growth and the unemployment rate (Table 2).  The average probability assigned to inflation being above the target at the two-year horizon fell back a little relative to the previous survey, but inflation was still judged a little more likely to be above the target than below it;  in contrast, the MPC judges the risks around the target to be broadly balanced at that point (Chart A). On average, respondents’ views of the balance of risks to GDP growth over the next three years had shifted to the upside.  The average probability attached to GDP growth being more than 3% has increased noticeably over the past three months, at all horizons. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Per cent Average of other   forecasters’ probabilities  Probability implied by   the MPC’s projections(a) 2007 08 09 10 11 12 13 Sources:  Bank of England and projections of outside forecasters provided for Inflation Reports between February 2007 and November 2013.

2014-02-12,"Inflation Report February 2014   BANK OF ENGLAND Inflation Report February 2014 In order to maintain price stability, the Government has set the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) a target for the annual inflation rate of the Consumer Prices Index of 2%. Subject to that, the MPC is also required to support the Government’s economic policy, including its objectives for growth and employment. The Inflation Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff under the guidance of the members of the Monetary Policy Committee.  It serves two purposes.  First, its preparation provides a comprehensive and forward-looking framework for discussion among MPC members as an aid to our decision-making.  Second, its publication allows us to share our thinking and explain the reasons for our decisions to those whom they affect. Although not every member will agree with every assumption on which our projections are based, the fan charts represent the MPC’s best collective judgement about the most likely paths for inflation, output and unemployment, as well as the uncertainties surrounding those central projections. This Report has been prepared and published by the Bank of England in accordance with  section 18 of the Bank of England Act 1998.

Much of that expansion was driven by consumer spending, as lifting uncertainty and easing credit conditions prompted households to reduce their rate of saving. That brightening in the economic environment also prompted a revival in the housing market, with housing transactions in 2013 Q4 up more than 25% on a year earlier, accompanied by a pickup in house price inflation.  This revival helped support strong growth in housing investment.  In contrast, business investment has remained subdued, although surveys of investment intentions suggest that it is likely to gather pace this year.  Despite stronger activity in the United Kingdom’s main overseas markets, export performance continued to disappoint.  The strength of domestic activity contributed to a slight firming in short-term market interest rates and a further appreciation in sterling.  The recovery in output has not yet been matched by a material pickup in productivity growth.  Instead, gains in employment have been exceptionally strong:  since the MPC announced its policy guidance last August, almost half a million more people have found work.  As a result, the LFS headline unemployment rate has fallen much more rapidly than the Committee anticipated and is likely to reach the MPC’s 7% threshold by the spring of this year. The UK recovery has gained momentum and inflation has returned to the 2% target.  Reduced uncertainty, easier credit conditions and the stimulative stance of monetary policy should support continued solid economic growth, with the expansion in demand becoming more entrenched and more broadly based. Robust growth has not so far been accompanied by a material pickup in productivity.  Instead, employment gains have been exceptionally strong and unemployment has fallen much more rapidly than expected.  The LFS headline unemployment rate is likely to reach the MPC’s 7% threshold by the spring of this year.  Even so, the Committee judges that there remains spare capacity, concentrated in the labour market. Inflation is likely to remain close to the target over the forecast period.  Given this, and with  spare capacity remaining, the MPC judges that there remains scope to absorb slack further before raising Bank Rate.  Moreover, the continuation of significant headwinds — both at home and from abroad — mean that Bank Rate may need to remain at low levels for some time to come.    Overview 5 With unemployment nearing that threshold, the Committee has reviewed the current and prospective degree of spare capacity in the economy.  Although such estimates are necessarily uncertain, the Committee judges that spare capacity remains, equivalent to around 1%–1½% of GDP and concentrated in the labour market.  Around half of that slack reflects the difference between unemployment and an estimate of its medium-term equilibrium rate.  Bank staff have revised down their estimate of the medium-term equilibrium rate reflecting the disproportionate falls in longer-term unemployment over recent months.  The medium-term equilibrium rate is likely to continue to drift down over the forecast period as unemployment falls further.  The remaining slack largely reflects an assessment that there is scope for companies to increase further the hours worked by their employees.  In particular, despite an increase in average hours worked since last summer, the number of people indicating they would like to work longer hours has remained elevated.   The Committee continues to expect a gradual recovery in productivity growth.  As demand picks up further, some businesses should be able to redeploy staff to more productive activities.  Easier credit conditions and reduced uncertainty may allow capital and labour to be reallocated towards more productive companies.  And a recovery in business investment should also provide support.  The recent weakness in productivity growth has nevertheless caused the Committee to revise down its judgement of the likely strength of the response of productivity to higher demand.  More generally, the timing and strength of the pickup in productivity remain highly uncertain. Chart 1 shows the Committee’s best collective judgement for four-quarter GDP growth, assuming that Bank Rate follows a path implied by market interest rates and the stock of purchased assets stays at £375 billion.  Growth eases a little in the near term as the initial fillip from the release of pent-up demand fades.  Thereafter, the recovery is projected to move to a firmer footing:  a gradual revival in productivity underpins a modest pickup in pay growth, while stronger demand and improved corporate sentiment drive a rebound in business investment.   The strengthening of activity in advanced economies means that the risks around the global outlook are judged to be more balanced than of late.  However, tensions in some emerging economies have resurfaced, and the need for further adjustment within the euro area continues to pose a risk to  UK growth.  At home, the main risks to the durability of the recovery are that sustained weakness in productivity prevents a pickup in household incomes and that companies are slow to increase their capital expenditure in response to rising demand. But the possibility of a virtuous cycle in sentiment, spending and incomes means there could be even greater near-term momentum in growth.  9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 2009 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Percentage increases in output on a year earlier Projection   Bank estimates of past growth ONS data   + – Chart 1 GDP projection based on market interest rate expectations and £375 billion purchased assets The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for GDP growth.  It has been conditioned on the assumption that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remains at £375 billion throughout the forecast period. To the left of the vertical dashed line, the distribution reflects the likelihood of revisions to the data over the past; to the right, it reflects uncertainty over the evolution of GDP growth in the future.  If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that the mature estimate of GDP growth would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of those occasions.  The fan chart is constructed so that outturns are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter green areas on 30 occasions.  In any particular quarter of the forecast period, GDP growth is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fan on 90 out of 100 occasions.  And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions GDP growth can fall anywhere outside the green area of the fan chart.  Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey background.  See the box on page 39 of the November 2007 Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.    6 Inflation Report  February 2014 A gradual revival in productivity growth, together with a slight easing in the pace of expansion, should lead to a marked slowing in the rate at which the degree of spare capacity is used up.  As a consequence, based on the same assumptions as Chart 1, unemployment is expected to fall less rapidly than in the recent past (Chart 2), with some spare capacity likely to remain even at the forecast horizon.   But the future path of unemployment is highly uncertain.  In particular, for a given growth profile, slack will be eroded more quickly if the impediments to productivity growth are more deeply rooted and take longer to rectify.  Alternatively, unemployment may fall more slowly if companies have greater capacity than the MPC judges to expand output without increasing employment or if there is a period of  catch-up in productivity as companies adopt a backlog of innovations and technical advances. Costs and prices CPI inflation fell to 2% in December, a fall of almost  1 percentage point since June.  The vast majority of that fall appears to reflect the impact of various one-off and idiosyncratic price movements, rather than a more generalised easing in underlying cost and price pressures, which were already subdued.  Oil prices have fallen by around 6% over the past year and other commodity prices have fallen by more than 10%.  The further appreciation of sterling should also act to dampen import price pressures.  Domestically, unit labour costs have risen less than their average historical rate, in part reflecting the drag on pay from labour market slack.  The news on inflation expectations since November has, on balance, been good and most measures of medium-term expectations remain close to past averages.  Overall, the MPC continues to judge that medium-term inflation expectations remain sufficiently well anchored.   Chart 3 shows the Committee’s best collective judgement of the outlook for CPI inflation, on the same basis as Chart 1.  The near-term outlook is lower than in November, reflecting unexpectedly weak inflation outturns, smaller rises in utility prices than the MPC had assumed, and the impact of sterling’s recent appreciation.  Inflation is expected to remain at, or slightly below, the target over the forecast period, as the waning impetus from past increases in import prices and from administered and regulated prices is offset by a diminishing drag from spare capacity.  The probability of CPI inflation being at or above the 2.5% knockout 18 to 24 months ahead remains around one third (Chart 4).    The inflation outlook is sensitive to several factors.  The path of inflation will depend on the pace at which slack is absorbed and the impact that slack has on wages and prices.  It is possible that the recent unexpectedly sharp falls in inflation reflect underlying cost and price pressures that are weaker than currently judged.  Inflation will also be sensitive to 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 2009 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Unemployment rate, per cent   0 The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for LFS unemployment.  It has been conditioned on the assumption that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remains at £375 billion throughout the forecast period.  If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that the mature estimate of unemployment would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of those occasions.  The fan chart is constructed so that outturns are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter blue areas on 30 occasions.  In any particular quarter of the forecast period, unemployment is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fan on 90 out of 100 occasions.  And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions unemployment can fall anywhere outside the blue area of the fan chart.  Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey background.  The calibration of this fan chart takes account of the likely path dependency of the economy, where, for example, it is judged that shocks to unemployment in one quarter will continue to have some effect on unemployment in successive quarters.  The fan begins in 2013 Q4, a quarter earlier than the fan for CPI inflation.  That is because Q4 is a staff projection for the unemployment rate, based in part on data for October and November. The unemployment rate was 7.1% in the three months to November, and is projected to remain at 7.1% in Q4 as a whole.

It has been conditioned on the assumption that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remains at £375 billion throughout the forecast period.  If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that inflation in any particular quarter would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of those occasions.  The fan chart is constructed so that outturns of inflation are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter red areas on 30 occasions.  In any particular quarter of the forecast period, inflation is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fan on 90 out of 100 occasions.  And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions inflation can fall anywhere outside the red area of the fan chart.  Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey background.  See the box on pages 48–49 of the May 2002 Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.    Overview 7 developments in commodity prices and the exchange rate, both of which can move sharply. The policy decision The UK recovery has gained momentum.  Unemployment has fallen more sharply than expected;  nonetheless spare capacity remains.  CPI inflation has fallen back to the 2% target more quickly than anticipated and, with domestic costs well contained, is expected to remain at, or a little below, the target for the next few years. At its February meeting, the Committee noted that the existence of spare capacity is both wasteful and increases the risk that inflation will undershoot the inflation target in the medium term.  Moreover, the outlook for inflation meant that the near-term trade-off between keeping inflation close to the target and supporting output and employment was more favourable than in recent years.  The MPC therefore judged that there remained scope to absorb spare capacity further before raising Bank Rate. It seemed likely that data released over the next few months would show that the 7% threshold has been reached.  The Committee agreed on further guidance for when the  threshold was reached.  That guidance is explained in the box ‘Monetary policy as the economy recovers’ on pages 8–9. Essentially, the MPC will seek to close the spare capacity in the economy over the next two to three years while keeping inflation close to the target.  To that end, it judges that there is scope for the economy to recover further before Bank Rate is raised and, even when Bank Rate does rise, it is expected to do so only gradually and to a level materially below its pre-crisis average of 5%. In the light of both the economic outlook and its policy guidance, the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5% and the stock of purchased assets at £375 billion.  0  10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90  100  Per cent Average probability for  2015 Q3 and 2015 Q4   2014 15 16 17 Q1 Q1 Q1 Q1 Q2 Q2 Q2 Q3 Q3 Q3 Q4 Q4 Q4 The bars in this chart are derived from the same distribution as Chart 3.

Monetary policy since the financial crisis The objective of monetary policy is to achieve the inflation target, and, subject to that, to support the Government’s economic policies, including those for growth and employment.  The stance of policy to achieve the inflation target will vary over time depending on the economic circumstances.  Following the global financial crisis, the MPC reduced Bank Rate to its historically low level of 0.5% and purchased assets amounting to £375 billion.  Last August, as the economy showed early signs of recovery but the degree of spare capacity remained large, the Committee provided guidance on the future stance of monetary policy, stating its intention to maintain (at a minimum) the current degree of exceptional monetary stimulus at least until the unemployment rate reached 7%, subject to maintaining price and financial stability.  Unemployment has since fallen sharply as the recovery has gained momentum, and it seems likely that data released in the next few months will show that the 7% threshold has been reached.  This box provides further guidance on the setting of policy once the unemployment threshold has been reached. Scope remains to absorb spare capacity further With inflation expectations well anchored, and in the absence of external price pressures, the MPC can consistently achieve the 2% inflation target in the medium term only if the economy is operating close to capacity.  When inflation is at target but the economy is operating below potential levels of activity, the MPC will, in the absence of other influences, set policy to stimulate demand to eliminate that spare capacity.  Spare capacity comprises slack within the labour market — one component of which is the gap between the actual unemployment rate and its medium-term equilibrium rate — and slack within companies.  Last August, given its assessment that there was substantial slack in the economy, the MPC specified the unemployment rate as the threshold for its policy guidance.  Although the Committee recognised that unemployment was not a comprehensive measure of economic slack, it chose the unemployment rate because it is less volatile than some alternative measures of slack, is not prone to substantial revisions, and is widely understood.   At the time it provided its policy guidance, the MPC stated that once unemployment had fallen to the 7% threshold, it would assess the state of the economy more broadly, drawing on a wide array of indicators.  Given that the threshold is likely to be reached in the next few months, that assessment is provided in this Inflation Report.  The MPC’s view is that the economy currently has spare capacity equivalent to about 1%–1½% of GDP, concentrated in the labour market.  Around half of that slack reflects the difference between the current unemployment rate of 7.1% and an estimate of its medium-term equilibrium rate of 6%–6½%.  The remaining slack largely reflects a judgement that employees would like to work more hours than is currently the case.  Companies appear to be operating at close to normal levels of capacity, although this is subject to some uncertainty. The existence of spare capacity in the economy is both wasteful and increases the risk that inflation will undershoot the target in the medium term.  Moreover, recent developments in inflation mean that the near-term trade-off between keeping inflation close to the target and supporting output and employment is more favourable than at the time the MPC announced its guidance last August:  CPI inflation has fallen back to the 2% target more quickly than anticipated  Overview 9 and, with domestic costs well contained, is expected to remain at, or a little below, the target for the next few years.  The MPC therefore judges that there remains scope to absorb spare capacity further before raising Bank Rate. Factors determining the timing and pace of tightening The legacy of the financial crisis and the persistence of economic headwinds mean that interest rates may need to remain at low levels for some time to come.  As discussed in the box on page 40, even when the economy has returned to normal levels of capacity and inflation is close to the target, the appropriate level of Bank Rate is likely to be materially below the 5% level set on average by the Committee prior to the crisis.  Given that the headwinds weighing on the recovery are likely to persist for some time, when Bank Rate does increase, it is expected to do so only gradually.  Raising Bank Rate gradually would also guard against the risk that, after a prolonged period of exceptionally low interest rates, increases in Bank Rate have a bigger impact than expected on output and spending.   The actual path Bank Rate will follow over the next few years is, however, uncertain and will depend on economic circumstances.  Bank Rate may rise more slowly than expected, and increases in Bank Rate may be reversed, if economic headwinds intensify or the recovery falters. Similarly, Bank Rate may be increased more rapidly than anticipated if economic developments raise the outlook for inflation significantly. The MPC’s assessment of the timing and extent of future policy action will be centred on the following factors: • The sustainability of the recovery. The MPC’s central expectation is that the recovery will become more entrenched and more broadly based.  Rising productivity should improve the outlook for pay and households’ real incomes, and so support the durability of the pickup in consumer spending that is already in train.  Moreover, the stronger demand outlook should encourage a rise in business investment, supported by further improvements in the cost and availability of credit.  A more broadly based improvement in activity should provide reassurance that the recovery will not be threatened by a gradual removal of monetary stimulus. • The extent to which supply responds to demand. An important part of the MPC’s assessment is the judgement that productivity growth will gradually increase, slowing the pace at which spare capacity is used up relative to the recent past.  Stronger demand, easier credit conditions and reduced uncertainty should facilitate movements of capital and labour to more productive uses, both within and across companies.  But the recent weakness in productivity growth has caused the Committee to revise down its assessment of the likely strength of the response of productivity growth to higher demand.  More generally, the precise timing and extent of the recovery in productivity is highly uncertain, and this uncertainty inevitably carries over into the outlook for policy.  If the recovery in productivity is more (less) rapid than expected, Bank Rate could rise more (less) slowly. • The evolution of cost and price pressures. Wage growth has remained muted, so that even with weak productivity growth, unit labour cost growth has been contained. Although pay growth is likely to pick up over the forecast period, this rise is expected to be modest by historical standards and largely to reflect a pickup in productivity growth.  Import price pressures also appear subdued, while the moderate pace of demand growth is likely to limit the extent to which profit margins are rebuilt.  The MPC judges that inflation expectations remain sufficiently well anchored and will continue to monitor them closely.  A continuation of these benign trends in costs and prices would tend to make the case for removing monetary stimulus less pressing.  Asset purchases and the Bank’s reinvestment policy A final factor affecting the path of Bank Rate is the timing, extent and speed at which the MPC chooses to unwind its asset purchases.  Last August, the MPC stated its intention not to reduce the stock of purchased assets at least until the 7% unemployment rate threshold was reached, and, consistent with that, to reinvest the cash flows associated with all maturing gilts held in the Asset Purchase Facility (APF). Updating this guidance, the MPC intends to maintain the stock of purchased assets, including reinvesting the cash flows associated with all maturing gilts held in the APF, at least until Bank Rate has been raised from its current level of 0.5%. Monetary policy and risks to financial stability Financial instability can have lasting effects on the economy, damaging growth and endangering price stability.  The Committee remains mindful that a prolonged period of low rates could lead to risks to financial stability.  The financial stability knockout recognises that, in some circumstances, monetary policy has an important role to play in mitigating financial stability risks, but only as a last line of defence;  that is, if the risks cannot be contained by the substantial range of mitigating policy actions available to the Financial Policy Committee, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority in a way consistent with their objectives. This division of responsibilities between regulatory policy and monetary policy will continue once the 7% unemployment threshold is reached and the financial stability knockout no longer applies.  This will allow monetary policy to remain focused on its primary objective of maintaining price stability while supporting a sustained recovery.  10 Inflation Report  February 2014  1 Money and asset prices Official interest rates in the United Kingdom and other advanced economies remained at historically low levels.  UK market interest rates have, however, edged higher over the past  three months, probably reflecting continued positive news about the strength of the recovery.  That news, alongside financial market turbulence in some emerging economies, was associated with a further appreciation of sterling.  Credit conditions facing households and companies continued to improve and housing market activity strengthened. 1.1 Monetary policy and financial markets Monetary policy and market interest rates In the United Kingdom, the MPC maintained Bank Rate at 0.5% and the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at £375 billion, consistent with its stated intention, at a minimum, to maintain the present highly stimulative stance of monetary policy at least until the unemployment rate falls to 7%, provided that this does not entail material risks to price or financial stability.(1) Results from a Reuters poll conducted in late January indicated that strong UK data — in particular, unemployment data (Section 3) — had led economists, on average, to bring forward the date at which they expect the unemployment threshold to be reached by around 18 months, to 2014 Q1.  But expectations about the date of the first rise in Bank Rate were revised by only six months, to 2015 Q2.   The date of the first rise in Bank Rate implied by market interest rates — 2015 Q2 — was broadly similar in the run-up to the February Report to three months earlier.  But the yield curve two to three years ahead steepened slightly (Chart 1.1), suggesting that the subsequent pace of tightening is expected to be faster than previously anticipated.  Market contacts suggested that forward interest rates would have been higher in the absence of the MPC’s policy guidance.(2) Survey evidence, discussed in the box on page 12, suggests that guidance has also lowered companies’ interest rate expectations, although the evidence on households’ expectations is less clear. In the United States, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) slowed the monthly pace of asset purchases from Table 1.A Monitoring the MPC’s key judgements  Developments expected in the  November Report Developments since November Cost and availability of credit Broadly as expected • Further modest declines in the cost of credit to some households and smaller companies. • Further falls in new loan rates for households.  Surveys suggest loan rates lower for larger companies but unchanged for small. • Further increases in credit availability. • Marked rise in mortgage availability at high LTV ratios.  Improved availability for companies. Mortgage approvals On track • A rise in mortgage approvals for house purchase to around 70,000 a month in 2013 Q4, and around 90,000 in 2014 Q2 onwards. • Mortgage approvals averaged 70,000 in Q4 and are expected to average around 90,000 in 2014 Q2 and Q3. PNFC lending On track • Pace of decline in four-quarter PNFC net lending easing in 2013 Q4;  return to growth from 2014 Q1 onwards. • Pace of decline eased in Q4;  growth still expected to turn positive in Q1. Evolution of sterling Higher than expected • Sterling broadly flat, in line with conditioning assumptions. • Sterling appreciated by around 3½%.

Chart 1.1 Bank Rate and forward market interest rates(a)  Section 1 Money and asset prices 11 Monetary policy since the November Report The MPC’s central projection in the November Report, under the assumptions that Bank Rate followed a path implied by market interest rates and that the stock of purchased assets remained at £375 billion, was that four-quarter GDP growth would pick up further in the near term before easing back, while CPI inflation would fall a little further in the near term and remain around, or a little below, the 2% target thereafter. The news during the month preceding the MPC’s meeting on 4–5 December continued to point to a burgeoning recovery in output.  In addition, employment had risen by more than expected in Q3, and the LFS unemployment rate had fallen to 7.6% in the three months to September.  As a result, the period of very weak productivity growth had continued.  The fact that there appeared to have been almost no cyclical recovery in productivity since the start of 2013 was surprising, but it was too soon to draw firm conclusions on the responsiveness of effective supply to stronger demand.  There had been a slight tightening in monetary conditions over the month, with UK longer-term market implied interest rates rising by around 20 basis points and sterling appreciating by around 2%.  All Committee members agreed that neither of the price stability knockout conditions that would override the policy guidance provided in August had been breached.  CPI inflation had fallen to 2.2% in October.  And the probability of CPI inflation being at or above 2.5% 18 to 24 months ahead was judged to be lower on the month, in part reflecting downside news arising from the appreciation of sterling and the Government’s announcement that around £50 of policy costs would be removed from annual household energy bills. Medium-term inflation expectations were judged to remain sufficiently well anchored.  In addition, the FPC had judged at its meeting on 20 November that the financial stability knockout had not been breached. With unemployment remaining above the 7% threshold, the Committee’s policy guidance therefore remained in place and no member thought it appropriate to tighten, or to loosen, the stance of monetary policy.  Against that backdrop, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5% and the stock of purchased assets at £375 billion. At the time of its meeting on 8–9 January, the MPC noted that the domestic recovery appeared to have taken hold, with upward revisions to GDP growth in earlier quarters  suggesting more momentum than previously believed. Monetary conditions had tightened as financial asset prices reacted to further evidence of a strengthening recovery, particularly news on unemployment.  Employment had  grown quickly, which had resulted in an unexpectedly sharp fall in the unemployment rate to 7.4% in the three months to October.  And a range of evidence suggested that the unemployment rate was likely to reach the 7% threshold materially earlier than previously expected.  The apparent  lack, so far, of a significant cyclical improvement in productivity during the recovery suggested that there was less slack within businesses than previously believed.  But labour market slack might not have been eroded as much as the fall in the headline unemployment rate appeared to imply, as transition rates out of longer-term unemployment had risen. Weak pay growth also pointed to continued slack in the labour market. All Committee members agreed that neither of the price stability knockout conditions that would override the policy guidance provided in August had been breached.  CPI inflation had fallen to 2.0% in December and news during the month — for example, the continued appreciation of sterling — had reduced the likelihood of CPI inflation being above 2.5% 18 to 24 months ahead.  And there was no reason to alter the judgement that medium-term inflation expectations remained sufficiently well anchored.  The FPC had not met since 20 November, so there was no change to its judgement that the financial stability knockout had not been breached. With unemployment remaining above the 7% threshold, the Committee’s policy guidance therefore remained in place. Against that backdrop, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5% and the stock of purchased assets at £375 billion. At its meeting on 5–6 February, the MPC voted to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5% and the stock of purchased assets at £375 billion.  The Committee reached its decisions in the context of the policy guidance announced in the August Report. US$85 billion to US$75 billion at its December meeting, and then to US$65 billion at its January meeting, in light of an improved labour market outlook.  That slowing was balanced by guidance about the path of the federal funds rate:  the FOMC now anticipates that it will probably be appropriate to maintain the policy rate at exceptionally low levels well past the time that the unemployment rate falls below 6.5%.   The European Central Bank has maintained its policy rates at historically low levels and reiterated that its key policy rates  12 Inflation Report  February 2014  The effects of the MPC’s policy guidance on businesses and households  In August 2013, the MPC provided guidance about the future path of policy, stating its intention not to raise Bank Rate at least until the unemployment rate fell to a threshold of 7%, provided this did not entail material risks to either price or financial stability.  This box uses surveys of businesses conducted by Markit and the Bank’s Agents, and a GfK NOP survey of households, to assess the effects of this guidance.(1) Businesses Awareness of the MPC’s policy guidance appears to be high among companies and it seems to have boosted their confidence and spending.  Around 75% of the companies surveyed by Markit, and 90% of those asked by the Bank’s Agents, knew what guidance the MPC had given when asked to select from a list of options.  Almost half of respondents to each survey reported that they expected Bank Rate to remain at current low levels for longer than they would have done were guidance not in place (Table 1).  And the majority reported that the Bank’s policy guidance had made them more confident about UK economic prospects (Table 2).(2) That is similar to the 59% of respondents to the 2013 Q4 Deloitte CFO Survey who reported that Bank communications since July had boosted their confidence.  On balance, companies indicated that the Bank’s recent policy guidance had caused them to bring forward or increase spending and increase hiring (Table 3).  Evidence on whether they would take on more debt was mixed.   Households  Households appeared to be less aware of guidance than companies and, perhaps reflecting that, reported it had had little effect on their behaviour.(3) Only around one fifth of households responding to the GfK NOP survey identified the MPC’s guidance from a list of options — although almost half knew it to be a statement of intent about Bank Rate.  And fewer than one in four respondents said that guidance had led them to lower their interest rate expectations (Table 1). Around a sixth of households reported to GfK NOP that guidance had boosted their confidence about the economic outlook or their own financial position (Table 2).  But the same proportion felt less confident.  About half of those were over 55, so that could reflect savers feeling less well off from a period of low interest rates.  Most households reported that guidance would not affect their spending (Table 3). Conclusion Overall, guidance appears to have had a greater direct effect on companies than on households, perhaps reflecting lower awareness among the latter.  Guidance may, however, indirectly affect households’ interest rate expectations and spending — for example, through media reports on the outlook for rates and its effects on business spending.

On average, around two thirds of respondents to the Bank/NOP household surveys select from a list of options the Bank of England as the group that sets the United Kingdom’s basic interest rate level, while around two fifths identify the MPC or the Bank without prompting.  Section 1 Money and asset prices 13 would remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time.  Since the November Report, central banks in some emerging economies — including Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey — have tightened policy in response to sharp outflows of capital and currency depreciations, in part triggered by US monetary policy actions.  So far, the countries that have been most affected have been characterised by country-specific factors, including political uncertainty.  But a number of other emerging economies with large current account deficits and high inflation remain vulnerable.  UK and US longer-term interest rates continued to rise in tandem for most of the period since the November Report (Chart 1.2).  In contrast, ten-year government bond yields in Germany were broadly flat, so that spreads relative to UK  and US yields widened.  That is likely to reflect expectations that euro-area growth will remain subdued for a protracted period, given the need to raise competitiveness and reduce indebtedness in the periphery, whereas the UK and US recoveries are expected to gain momentum.  More recently, UK, US and German long-term rates fell, as capital flowed into safe-haven assets. Market perceptions of the likelihood of disorderly adjustment in the euro area have continued to wane over the past three months.  That has contributed to further falls in euro-area periphery sovereign bond spreads over German yields (Chart 1.2).  Several euro-area periphery governments issued new debt, including Portugal and Ireland, and investor demand for these bonds was strong.  Exchange rates The sterling effective exchange rate index (ERI) has appreciated by about 3½% since the November Report and now stands almost 10% above its March 2013 trough (Chart 1.3).  That leaves the sterling ERI at the top of the band within which it has traded since the substantial depreciation of 2007–08.   Sterling has appreciated against a broad range of currencies since March 2013, largely reflecting the more positive news about prospects for activity in the United Kingdom.  It rose by about 5% against the euro, 10% against the US dollar, and more than 15% against the yen, which depreciated after the Bank of Japan launched its monetary stimulus package in April 2013.  Some of sterling’s appreciation also reflected the recent depreciations in emerging economies. Equities Advanced-economy equity prices rose over much of the period since the November Report (Chart 1.4).

Nevertheless, UK and US nominal equity prices remain close to all-time highs;  euro-area equity prices remain below their pre-crisis peak.  1.2 The banking sector The cost and availability of bank credit depend, in part, on banks’ own ability to access funds.  Since August 2012, banks have been able to obtain funding through the Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS).  Following a change to the terms of  the Scheme in late November 2013, the amounts that  lenders will be able to borrow over the coming year will no longer increase with their net lending to households.  The associated regulatory capital offset for household lending has also been discontinued, but that for corporate lending extended.(1) Those changes to the FLS appear, as expected, to have had little effect on wholesale bank funding spreads, which have been broadly flat over the past three months (Chart 1.5).  Rises in the market interest rates used as reference rates for these spreads — such as the five-year swap rate — mean, however, that the cost of wholesale funding was higher than at the time of the November Report.  In contrast, the cost of longer-term retail funding ticked down between October and January. Credit conditions are also influenced by banks’ capital positions.  Since the crisis, UK banks’ core Tier 1 capital levels have risen by around £140 billion.  They are likely to increase further in subsequent quarters, as regulatory changes continue to require banks to improve their capital resilience.  Higher capital levels should help support credit conditions and loan growth in the medium term.(2) 1.3 Credit conditions Credit conditions have improved broadly as expected since the November Report (Table 1.A).  The box on pages 16–17 shows that an indicator of household and company credit spreads fell slightly in Q4. Household unsecured credit  As anticipated three months ago, unsecured credit growth remained robust in Q4 (Chart 1.6).  That probably reflected further falls in rates charged on new loans (Chart 1.7) and increased availability, together with higher demand for credit as improved sentiment boosted consumers’ willingness to spend (Section 2).  Respondents to the Credit Conditions Survey (CCS) expected further improvements in unsecured credit conditions in Q1.

Section 1 Money and asset prices 15 Household secured credit and the housing market Secured credit availability has continued to rise over the past three months, largely as anticipated.  Evidence from the CCS indicates that the improvement has been particularly marked for mortgages with loan to value (LTV) ratios above 75%, with most lenders expecting availability to increase further in early 2014, especially at higher LTV ratios.   Quoted interest rates on new mortgages fell a little further, continuing the trend seen since mid-2012 (Chart 1.7).  That is despite a drift up since 2013 Q2 in the market interest rates lenders use as reference points when pricing mortgages, such as the two-year swap rate.  CCS participants attributed part of that narrowing in spreads between quoted mortgage rates and reference rates to increased competition.  Lenders indicated that spreads were unlikely to narrow much in Q1, suggesting that mortgage rates could start to rise if reference rates rise further. Results from the CCS indicate that the thawing in secured credit conditions, and the Government’s Help to Buy schemes have helped to release pent-up demand, and encouraged new demand for secured lending.  That has been associated with greater momentum in housing market activity:  the number of approvals for house purchase rose to an average of 70,000 per month in Q4, in line with expectations at the time of the November Report.  Past rises in mortgage approvals have partly been accounted for by borrowers with LTV ratios above 90% (Chart 1.8).  The outlook for mortgage approvals is largely unchanged:  the number per month is anticipated to rise to around 80,000 in Q1, then to a little over 90,000 by Q3 (Table 1.A). House prices also continued to rise.  The Halifax and Nationwide indices, on average, increased by around 2½% in the three months to January 2014 compared with the previous three months.  And house price inflation picked up in several regions of the United Kingdom.  Nonetheless, metrics of housing affordability — the ratio of house prices to earnings and income gearing — remained well below levels reached in 2007 (Section 2).  A range of forward-looking indicators point to further rises in house prices in the near term, although they provide very different signals about the pace of increase (Chart 1.9).   Stronger housing market activity has fed through into larger gross flows of secured lending to households.  But those have been largely matched by increased repayments, so that net lending has risen only slightly (Table 1.B).  That may, in part, reflect an increase in the proportion of properties bought using cash since the start of the crisis:  such transactions do not generate any new lending but do result in a repayment if the seller still has a mortgage outstanding.

The indicators are based on spreads between the cost of new finance for households or companies and appropriate risk-free rates.(2) These spreads are weighted together to reflect the importance of different types of credit for spending.  As such, the measures indicate how credit conditions have changed for new bank borrowing, rather than existing loans.  The interest rates and weights used are shown in Table 1. Chart A shows how these credit spreads for households and companies, both separately and combined, have changed since the start of the financial crisis in 2007 Q3.  The fact that estimated spreads are set to zero in 2007 Q3 does not mean that credit conditions were normal at that time — indeed, spreads were unsustainably compressed at the start of the crisis.  Rather, 2007 Q3 is used as a convenient reference point to show how conditions have evolved since then. Households To calculate the credit spread, households are divided into four groups depending on their most likely marginal source of finance, based on evidence from the British Household Panel Survey.  Credit spreads for each group are measured using ‘quoted’ interest rates — that is, interest rates advertised by lenders.   • Savers. Some households will have sufficient savings to finance extra spending.  For these individuals, the cost of that spending is taken to be the deposit rate they would have earned if they had saved instead.   • Secured borrowers. For homeowners, who can borrow against their home, the cost of new credit varies with the value of the loan relative to the value of the property:  the lower the loan to value (LTV) ratio, the lower is the amount of risk borne by the lender and so the lower the loan rate is likely to be.  So secured borrowers are divided into two groups:  those who borrow at LTV ratios of 75% or below; and those who borrow at LTV ratios above 75%. • Unsecured borrowers. Individuals who do not own a home and have insufficient savings would be most likely to finance extra spending through unsecured borrowing, using credit cards, overdrafts or personal loans.   Companies Calculating credit spreads for companies requires more judgement than for households because data on the cost of new bank loans to companies are limited.  In particular, there are no data on quoted company loan rates:  the data refer to ‘effective’ rates on loans that have been taken out.  These rates reflect the average riskiness of companies obtaining finance, and so may not be representative of the cost of credit for companies wanting to borrow more, for example if lenders have restricted credit availability.  Moreover, the variation since the crisis in credit spreads calculated from these effective rates is smaller than other indicators of credit conditions suggest.  For that reason, a range of other evidence, including Table 1 Interest rates used to estimate credit spreads  Interest rates  Households (70%)(a) of which:(b) depositors (50%) One-year and three-year fixed-rate bonds and  one-year time deposit low LTV borrowers (21%) New 75% LTV two-year fixed-rate, five-year fixed-rate,  and Bank Rate tracker mortgages   high LTV borrowers (4%) New 90% LTV two-year fixed-rate mortgage unsecured borrowers (25%) Credit card, overdraft, £5,000 personal loan and  £10,000 personal loan Companies (30%)(a) of which:(c) small and medium-sized Data on bank loan rates and judgement based on  enterprises (37%) evidence from the CCS and other surveys large businesses (63%) Data on corporate bond spreads and judgement  based on evidence from the CCS (a) Figures in parentheses show the weights used to construct the measure of overall credit spreads from the measures for households and companies.

(a) See footnote (a) to Table 1.  Chart A Changes since 2007 Q3 in indicators of household and company credit spreads(a)  Section 1 Money and asset prices 17 from surveys, is used to inform the estimate of the company credit spread. The overall company credit spread is based on separate estimates for large businesses and for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).  That is because the cost of bank credit is likely to vary by company size:  loans to smaller businesses tend to be riskier than those to larger ones, and lenders therefore typically charge higher rates to compensate them for bearing that extra risk.   • For large businesses: credit spreads are mainly estimated using spreads on corporate bonds, both because of data limitations and because many large businesses use bond market finance as well as bank credit.  These data are sometimes supplemented by judgement, based on information from the Credit Conditions Survey (CCS), in particular when corporate bond market conditions differ from bank credit conditions. • For SMEs: spreads are estimated by combining Bank and Department for Business, Innovation and Skills data on SME loan spreads with judgement based on evidence from the CCS and other surveys. Capturing changes in credit availability as well as cost Although the credit spread is calculated using data on the cost of credit, it is likely that it broadly reflects how the availability of credit has changed too.  That is largely because evidence from the CCS indicates that changes in credit availability have been correlated with changes in loan spreads.  In addition, the weights used in the household credit spread are varied to capture specific episodes when lenders have restricted credit availability.  For example, to reflect the withdrawal of high LTV ratio mortgages early in the crisis, the weight of high LTV borrowers was reduced and the weight of unsecured borrowers correspondingly increased.  Nevertheless, even though the credit spread may reflect broad trends in credit availability, it is unlikely to capture these effects precisely. The outlook for credit conditions Credit spreads have narrowed since the heights of the crisis, and further compression is likely as the banking sector continues to heal.  But credit spreads are likely to remain persistently wider than they were in the period immediately before the crisis, reflecting higher bank funding costs as implicit government guarantees are reduced, and more accurate pricing of the risk of loans by banks.  As noted in the box on page 40, that persistent widening in spreads is one reason why Bank Rate might be expected to remain low for some time to come.   (1) The role of credit conditions in explaining recent macroeconomic performance is discussed in Barnett, A and Thomas, R (2013), ‘Has weak lending and activity in the United Kingdom been driven by credit supply shocks?’, Bank of England Working Paper No. 482. (2) The measures of risk-free interest rates used to calculate spreads are overnight index swap rates of the same maturity, because these provide the best indicator of the average level of Bank Rate that is expected to prevail over the term of the loan. prices, should boost gross lending relative to repayments in coming quarters and so raise net lending. Increased housing market activity has also yet to translate into increased housing equity withdrawal (HEW) (Chart 1.10).  In aggregate, HEW is the difference between net secured lending to households and increases in the stock of housing wealth when either new properties are built or improvements are made to existing ones.  So the continued weakness in HEW partly reflects the same factors that underlie the weakness in net lending.  In addition, loan approvals for further advances on existing mortgages have remained muted (Table 1.B), indicating that weak HEW is also partly due to households not withdrawing equity to finance spending.(1) The recovery in the housing market could — if accompanied by sizable and rapid rises in house prices, increased household indebtedness and higher leverage in the banking sector — begin to create risks to financial stability.  In the November 2013 Financial Stability Report, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) noted that several actions were in train that will guard against the build-up of such vulnerabilities.

The FPC also noted that, should further steps become necessary, it has an extensive toolkit that it could deploy, including recommendations on underwriting standards and the availability of higher-risk loans, as well as recommendations or directions on bank capital requirements. Corporate credit  Overall, bank credit conditions facing companies appear to have improved further over the past three months, in line with expectations at the time of the November Report.  For example, results from the CCS indicate that corporate credit availability continued to rise, including for companies in the commercial real estate sector.   The improvements in credit conditions still appear to be greater for large companies than for smaller businesses.  For example, in the CCS, a higher net balance of lenders reported increased availability of credit for large private non-financial corporations (PNFCs) than for small and medium-sized businesses;  and while loan spreads were reported, on balance, to have narrowed for large PNFCs, they were broadly unchanged for small companies (Table 1.C).  Indeed, results from the Federation of Small Businesses survey indicated that the loan rates offered to small companies in 2013 Q4 were slightly higher than those offered in Q3, although the average rate offered remained lower than in early 2012.   Evidence from the CCS suggests that company demand for bank credit has increased over the past three months, particularly among medium-sized businesses.  Consistent with that pickup, and the improvements in credit conditions, the four-quarter rate of contraction in the stock of loans to companies lessened to -0.7% in Q4 from -1.8% in Q3, in line with expectations three months ago.  Nevertheless, companies in aggregate still repaid more finance than they raised, despite robust bond issuance (Table 1.D).  As was the case three months ago, companies’ demand for finance is expected to rise further in Q1, and loan growth to turn positive.  1.4 Money Broad money growth remained robust in 2013 Q4, at 3.7% (Chart 1.11).  As has been the case in recent quarters, that strength was predominantly accounted for by flows into household sight deposits.  But PNFC money growth has picked up by more.  In part, that is likely to reflect an increase in companies’ desired money holdings — for example, due to an increase in the volatility of cash flows.  As businesses’ actual money holdings rise above desired levels, they may draw on the excess to finance capital expenditure.  UK output rebounded strongly in 2013, having been broadly flat in 2012 (Chart 2.1).  That recovery has been underpinned by an easing in credit conditions (Section 1), a revival in optimism and a reduction in uncertainty, which have helped release pent-up demand (Section 2.1).  The fiscal consolidation is set to continue to weigh on spending, however, and although external demand growth has picked up a little, it remains weak — particularly in the euro area (Section 2.2). The recovery appears to have more momentum than it did  at the time of the November Report.  The ONS estimates that the level of GDP is 0.6% higher than previously recorded, largely reflecting revisions to consumption since mid-2012; consumption growth was also stronger than anticipated in Q3. Other near-term indicators suggest that the MPC’s key judgements on demand from the November Report are broadly on track (Table 2.A), although exports were weaker than expected in Q3. Nominal spending has been more volatile than real GDP. Having grown by only 0.6% in Q2, nominal spending grew  by 1.4% in Q3 (Table 2.B). 2.1 Domestic demand Household spending Consumption has increased robustly over recent quarters, despite household incomes stagnating (Table 2.C).  Following upward revisions, the latest ONS figures suggest that household spending grew by 0.7% on average in each of the four quarters to 2013 Q3 — just a little below pre-crisis rates (Table 2.C).  Labour income growth was negligible over that period (Table 2.C), as the strength of employment growth (Section 3), was offset by the weakness of real wages (Section 4).  Non-labour income growth was also subdued. Although wage growth probably remained weak in Q4 (Section 4), consumption indicators such as private car registrations and the CBI Distributive Trades Survey point  UK demand continued to grow solidly in 2013 Q3.  Improved consumer confidence supported a rise in household spending growth, which helped offset weak export growth.  The near-term outlook is robust, with business confidence indicators pointing to a pickup in business investment growth. Prospects for net trade are less encouraging, however, with strong domestic demand likely to attract higher imports, while UK-weighted world demand growth will probably be relatively subdued in the near term. 2 Demand Table 2.A Monitoring the MPC’s key judgements Developments expected in the November Report Developments since November Consumer spending A little stronger than expected • Quarterly consumer spending growth of around 0.5%, or a little stronger, in 2013 H2 and 2014 H1. • Consumption growth stronger than anticipated in Q3, likely to be stronger in 2013 Q4. Investment Broadly on track  • Indicators of business investment consistent with average growth rates of around, or a little above, 2% a quarter in 2013 H2 and 2014 H1.  • Housing investment growth to remain strong over the next year, averaging around 5% per quarter. • Q3 growth broadly in line with expectations but investment intentions firm. • Growth in Q3 weaker than anticipated but housing starts continue to suggest a strong pickup.   Advanced economies  Broadly on track   • Quarterly euro-area GDP growth averaging around a quarter of a percentage point in 2013 H2 and 2014 H1. • Quarterly US GDP growth to average around, or a little above, 0.5% in 2013 H2 and 2014 H1. • Growth slightly weaker than anticipated in Q3, but outlook a touch stronger. • 2013 H2 stronger than expected. Broadly in line with expectations thereafter.   Rest of the world  Broadly on track • Indicators of activity consistent with four-quarter growth of around 7.5% in China and around 4% in the other emerging economies in 2013 H2 and 2014 H1. • Growth broadly in line with expectations but some increase in financial stresses in emerging economies.  Risks remain to the downside. Section 2 Demand 19  to sustained spending growth.  Set against that evidence, however, information from the Bank’s Agents suggests that momentum may have slowed slightly since Q3.  On balance, Bank staff project that consumption is likely to have grown  by around ¾% in Q4.  As a consequence, consumption in 2013 H2 as a whole is likely to have been stronger than expected in the November Report. The corollary of rising consumption and broadly flat real post-tax household income has been a falling saving ratio (Chart 2.2).  The key factors prompting, or enabling, households to spend more of their incomes are likely to  have been a reduction in uncertainty, improved income expectations and a further easing of consumer credit conditions (Section 1).  A reduction in uncertainty is likely to have led some households to reduce their precautionary savings;  spending  is also likely to have been supported by expectations of  higher future income.  It is difficult to separate the impact  of these two drivers, but survey evidence suggests that consumer confidence, which is likely to reflect both, has improved markedly during 2013.  For example, responses to the GfK survey indicate that households’ unemployment expectations have fallen and their expectations about their future financial situation have improved.  Disaggregated expenditure data provide further evidence:  discretionary non-durable spending — for example in restaurants and  hotels — which has tended to be correlated with consumer confidence indicators, picked up during 2013 following falls  in 2012 (Chart 2.3). Household lending data suggest that easing credit conditions may also have supported consumption growth;  growth in unsecured loans to households in 2013 was the fastest since 2008.  As well as directly boosting the expenditure of credit-constrained households, easier access to credit has probably reduced some households’ incentive to build up savings in case they are unable to obtain credit when needed. Easier secured credit conditions and the related increase in housing market activity could also support consumption a little.(1) To date, however, households do not appear to be withdrawing housing equity to finance higher spending (Section 1).  The household debt to income ratio has fallen by 30 percentage points since 2009 Q2 (Chart 2.4). Nevertheless, it remains well above its pre-crisis average.   And concerns about debt probably still weighed on some households’ spending in recent quarters.  According to the NMG Consulting survey, the proportion of households concerned about their indebtedness was just under 40%  20 Inflation Report  February 2014 (1) For more information on the potential impact of the housing market revival on consumption, see the box on pages 20–21 of the November 2013 Inflation Report.

The future path of consumption will therefore depend on the pace of household income growth. In turn, that will be driven by the growth of employment (Section 3) and real wages (Section 4). Housing investment Private sector housing investment — comprising new dwellings, improvements to existing dwellings and spending on services associated with property transactions — rose by 1.6% in Q3 (Chart 2.5), which was lower than anticipated in November.  Much of the growth in Q3 was accounted for by new dwellings, and the significant rise in housing starts in 2013 (Table 2.D) should continue to feed through into new dwellings expenditure in the next few quarters.  Some of the factors supporting consumption growth over recent quarters, such as easier credit conditions and improved consumer confidence, are also likely to have boosted housing market activity. Business spending The ONS estimates that business investment rose by 2.0% in Q3.  Nevertheless, investment remained below its level a year earlier.  Although growth in Q3 was broadly in line with expectations in the November Report, the near-term outlook is a little stronger than anticipated.  Survey indicators of investment intentions picked up further in Q4 and continue to point to strong investment growth (Chart 2.6).  Based in part on these surveys, Bank staff believe that business investment is likely to have risen strongly in 2013 Q4. It is also possible that official estimates understate the  recent strength of investment.  Methodological changes implemented by the ONS in the 2013 Blue Book have made the data more volatile, making the underlying trend harder  to judge.  This uncertainty, combined with the strength  of investment indicators over the past year, suggest that investment over 2013 is more likely than not to be revised up. Several factors are likely to have increased companies’ appetite to invest during the second half of 2013.  For example, credit and capital market conditions continued to improve (Section 1) and more spare capacity has been absorbed (Section 3).  Companies’ optimism about near-term output and profitability also rose markedly, with business surveys suggesting that confidence was at post-crisis highs.  Uncertainty about the durability of the recovery has probably weighed on investment in the past, particularly given the Section 2 Demand 21 (1) For more information on the results of the 2013 NMG Consulting survey see  Bunn, P, Domit, S, Piscitelli, L, Rostom, M and Worrow, N (2013), ‘The financial position of British households:  evidence from the 2013 NMG Consulting survey’, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Vol. 53, No. 4, pages 351–60.

Uncertainty encourages businesses to wait to assess the persistence of stronger demand before undertaking capital expenditure. As the recovery proceeds and uncertainty dissipates further, postponed investment projects could therefore get the go-ahead.  It is also plausible that stronger investment growth could be self-reinforcing, as higher overall growth could provide an additional fillip to business confidence. Government spending The fiscal consolidation is planned to continue.  The Office  for Budget Responsibility (OBR) anticipates that the policy measures announced in the 2013 Autumn Statement will have a broadly neutral impact on GDP growth.  Nevertheless, OBR forecasts published at that time were for a more rapid fall in public sector net borrowing than expected in the March 2013 Budget;  a change largely related to higher projected tax receipts, associated with an upward revision to the OBR’s GDP forecasts. According to estimates by the Institute of Fiscal Studies,  using the March 2008 Budget as a baseline, around 45% of  the Government’s planned consolidation has taken place.  The planned increases in taxes associated with this consolidation have, for the most part, already happened, with a reduction  in government consumption set to account for most of the remaining consolidation.  2.2 External demand and UK trade UK-weighted world GDP grew by 0.6% in Q3, which  was broadly in line with expectations at the time of the November Report.  Within that, positive news on US demand was offset by slightly weaker-than-anticipated euro-area growth.  The overall near-term outlook, which is for modest but below average increases in UK-weighted world demand, is also similar to that at the time of the November Report.  The near-term prospects for advanced economies have improved  a little, while the downside risks to emerging economies have intensified.  The euro area Euro-area GDP grew by 0.1% in Q3 (Table 2.E), as  subdued French and German export growth weighed on output.  That was slightly weaker than anticipated at the  time of the November Report.  The near-term outlook for growth is a touch stronger, however, with output and consumer confidence indicators suggesting modest growth  in Q4 and 2014 Q1. Output indicators suggest that the pace of growth in the euro-area periphery more closely matched that in the core during 2013 H2.  Better export performance suggests that the external competitiveness of some periphery countries has improved over 2013, and financial market developments 22 Inflation Report  February 2014 Chart 2.4 Household debt to income and income gearing ratios Income gearing(b)   (left-hand scale)  Household debt to income(a)   (right-hand scale) 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 1988 93 98 2003 08 13 Per cent Per cent   (a) Household financial liabilities as a percentage of the four-quarter moving sum of post-tax income.

Nevertheless, intra euro-area differences in the amount of economic slack — particularly evident in unemployment rates — remain acute, pointing to the need  for further adjustment.  That suggests euro-area growth is likely to remain subdued for some time. Euro-area inflation fell steadily in 2013 according to both headline and core measures.  At 0.7% and 0.8% respectively  in January 2014, these were both well beneath the European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) definition of price stability, of inflation below but close to 2%.  The ECB expects underlying price pressures to remain subdued over the medium term.  In general, inflation remained higher in the core, while it was closer to zero in the periphery. The United States US GDP growth was robust in 2013 H2, averaging around 0.9% a quarter, which was well above expectations in the November Report.  Some of the strength in 2013 H2 reflected a rise in stockbuilding, which is unlikely to be repeated, although it may suggest greater business optimism about future demand.  The downside risks to US growth associated with fiscal policy have receded somewhat.  A Congressional deal on headline government spending in 2014 and 2015 agreed in December reduced the chance of further government shutdowns, and lowers the amount that the fiscal consolidation will drag on growth in the near term.  Even so, the consolidation will continue to weigh on US growth in 2014, albeit by less than  in the previous year.  And political uncertainty around the US debt ceiling remains. While US employment growth has been steady in 2013, it  has not been strong enough to raise the employment rate, which has remained flat since the recession (Chart 2.7).  The unemployment rate, which reached 6.7% in December, has fallen, however, as labour force participation has declined.   The prospects for labour force participation as the recovery proceeds are uncertain;  it is possible that at least some of that fall in participation represents a cyclical response to weak labour demand. Rest of the world Growth in the rest of the world in 2013 Q3 was broadly as anticipated in the November Report, but the intensification  of financial market stresses in emerging economies suggests greater downside risks to the near-term outlook. Growth in emerging economies over recent quarters has been slightly subdued relative to rates observed over much of the previous decade.  This continued in Q3, with growth at 5.3% on an annualised PPP-weighted basis.  Within that, Chinese Section 2 Demand 23 Table 2.E GDP in selected countries and regions(a) Percentage changes on a quarter earlier, annualised(b) Averages 2012 2013 1998–2007 H1 H2 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 United Kingdom 3.1 -0.8 1.4 2.0 3.2 3.2 2.8 Euro area (40%) 2.3 -0.7 -1.4 -0.8 1.2 0.5 n.a.

BCC data are non seasonally adjusted and cover the non-services and services sectors.  CBI data cover the manufacturing, distribution, financial services and consumer/business services sectors.  Data are to 2013 Q4.  GDP growth picked up slightly, while growth in other emerging economies was mixed (Table 2.E).  Since then, however, official data suggested that Chinese GDP growth weakened in Q4.  And financial markets tensions have increased in some emerging economies.   Some emerging economies have experienced renewed  capital outflows and sharp currency depreciations since the November Report.  The developments were partly prompted by the FOMC’s decision to reduce the pace of its asset purchases, but the countries most affected were those  with weak economic fundamentals or subject to political uncertainty.  Several emerging-economy central banks have responded by tightening policy (Section 1), which may dampen growth prospects. In Japan, both CPI inflation and inflation expectations have risen significantly since the Japanese authorities announced major monetary and fiscal stimulus packages in 2012 and 2013, aimed at boosting growth and achieving stable inflation around a target of 2%.  Although GDP growth moderated in Q3, activity remains fairly robust. UK trade and the current account The ONS reported that UK export growth was particularly weak in Q3, despite positive — albeit subdued — growth in UK-weighted world trade (Chart 2.8).  The 2.9% fall in export volumes was concentrated in goods exports outside the European Union.  Imports continued to rise, in part reflecting robust domestic consumption growth.  This resulted in a significant drag on growth from net trade, of 1.2 percentage points of GDP (Table 2.B). Monthly goods trade data suggest that net trade is likely to drag less on growth in Q4.  But UK domestic spending appears likely to be more robust than UK-weighted world demand in the first half of 2014, resulting in strong import demand and relatively subdued exports.   The UK current account deficit widened to 5.1% of nominal GDP in 2013 Q3, in part as a result of the wider trade deficit, but also reflecting a fall in net foreign investment income (Chart 2.9).  Net investment income was consistently positive prior to 2012, helping to offset the United Kingdom’s persistent trade deficit, in large part due to the income earned by UK PNFCs on their foreign direct investment (FDI).  But this FDI income has been lower recently.  This probably reflects a deterioration in the profits of UK-owned overseas operations. 24 Inflation Report  February 2014 Chart 2.8 UK-weighted world trade and UK exports 20 15 10 5 0 5 10 15 20 Percentage changes on a year earlier + – 2005 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 World trade(b) UK exports(a) Sources:  IMF WEO October 2013, OECD, ONS, Thomson Reuters Datastream and Bank calculations.

Section 3 Output and supply 25 The recovery in output gained momentum, but robust output growth has been accompanied by surprisingly large rises in employment.  As a result, the unemployment rate has fallen towards the MPC’s threshold of 7% much more quickly than expected (Table 3.A).  Productivity growth has remained weak (Section 3.1). The extent to which strong output and employment growth have reduced economic slack is a central judgement for the MPC.  Business surveys suggest that companies were operating at close to normal levels of capacity in Q4.  But a margin of labour market slack remains (Section 3.2). The speed at which slack is absorbed in 2014 and beyond will depend, in part, on how quickly productivity recovers.  The MPC expected productivity to pick up as demand recovered, judging that many companies would be able to use their existing workforce more effectively before taking on more staff.  That recovery in productivity growth has been slow to take hold (Section 3.3), causing the MPC to revise down its judgement of the likely strength of the response of productivity to higher demand.  Nevertheless, it continues to expect four-quarter productivity growth to rise gradually to around its pre-crisis average rate over the forecast period (Section 5). 3.1 Recent developments in output, the labour market and productivity Output The recovery in output gained momentum during 2013.   Four-quarter GDP growth reached 2.8% in Q4, its highest rate since the start of 2008, driven primarily by the service sector. But manufacturing output also boosted growth, in contrast to the drag imparted in 2012 (Chart 3.1).  Quarterly output growth softened a little to 0.7% in Q4 from 0.8% in Q3.  That was weaker than Bank staff had expected in November (Chart 3.2), largely reflecting an unexpected fall in construction output.  Taking account of survey information, Bank staff expect Q4 growth to be revised up to around 0.9% eventually. 3 Output and supply Output is estimated to have grown by 0.7% in Q4.  Business surveys point to robust growth in Q1. But the recovery in output growth has not yet been associated with a sustained increase in productivity.  The unemployment rate fell by more than expected to 7.1% in November, reflecting unusually strong employment growth, and is likely to reach the MPC’s 7% threshold by the spring. Nevertheless, a margin of slack within the labour market remains. Table 3.A Monitoring the MPC’s key judgements Developments expected in the November Report Developments since November Unemployment Much lower than expected  • Headline LFS unemployment rate to reach 7.5% by early 2014. • The unemployment rate was 7.1% in the three months to November.

GDP is at market prices.  The magenta diamond shows Bank staff’s central projection for the preliminary estimate of GDP growth for Q4 at the time of the November Report.  The green diamond shows the current staff projection for the preliminary estimate of GDP growth for Q1.  The bands on either side of the diamonds show uncertainty around those projections based on staff estimates of the root mean squared errors of forecasts for quarterly GDP growth made since 2004.  As the staff projections are for the preliminary estimates of GDP, they can differ from those used to construct the GDP fans, for example that shown in Chart 5.1, because those fans are based on the MPC’s best collective judgement of the final estimate of GDP. Output growth is expected to be robust in Q1.  The Q4 weakness in construction output growth should unwind, consistent with survey indicators.  Surveys also point to continued robust growth in manufacturing and services output.  Overall, Bank staff expect the preliminary estimate of GDP growth in Q1 to be around 0.8%, although the historical average error around the staff projection is wide at 0.3 percentage points (Chart 3.2).  That preliminary estimate is expected to be revised up over time;  the final estimate of Q1 growth incorporated in the MPC’s GDP fan chart is 0.9%. Labour demand and productivity Demand for labour has been surprisingly robust in recent months, and stronger than its past relationship with output would imply.  Employment rose by 280,000 in the three months to November, the largest three-month rise since the series began in 1971.  That rise was around four times larger than the average quarterly rise seen in the decade before the crisis, despite recent output growth being close to its pre-crisis average rate (Chart 3.3).  Self-employment accounted for just over half of the rise in total employment, taking its share to a series high (Chart 3.4).  Full-time and part-time employment both rose in the three months to November (Table 3.B). Strong demand for labour has been concentrated in the private sector;  public sector employment was flat in Q3.  The rise in employment in Q3 was broadly based across industries, although there were particularly strong increases in construction and real estate activities, according to Workforce Jobs data. A corollary of the surprising strength in employment growth in 2013 was unexpectedly weak productivity growth.  Quarterly productivity growth picked up in 2013 H1, but subsequently fell back.  In the four quarters to 2013 Q3, whole-economy output per hour rose by just 0.1%.  Productivity remained over 4% below its 2008 peak in Q3. Official data may understate the true level of productivity; the MPC’s backcast suggests that the level of GDP in 2013 Q3, and hence productivity, could eventually be revised up by 0.5%.  But those expected revisions are small compared with the unexpected weakness in productivity and are concentrated in 2011 and 2012, such that productivity growth in the first three quarters of 2013 is expected to be broadly unchanged from current estimates.  Based on the preliminary estimate of GDP, and the available labour market data and surveys, productivity is likely to have been broadly flat in Q4.  Bank staff project a rise of around ½% in the four quarters to 2014 Q1.  Section 3.3 discusses the factors influencing the prospects for productivity beyond Q1. Unemployment and labour supply Unemployment has fallen much faster than expected in the November Report, driven by strong labour demand.  The Labour Force Survey (LFS) unemployment rate fell to 7.1% in Chart 3.4 Self-employment share(a) 1992 96 2000 04 08 12 0 12 13 14 15 Per cent 11 Source:  Labour Force Survey.

Section 3 Output and supply 27 the three months to November, from 7.7% in the three months to August, whereas Bank staff had projected a much smaller fall to 7.6% (Chart 3.5).  That 0.5 percentage point discrepancy was around twice as large as the historical average error around the staff projection.  The headline LFS rate is projected to have remained at around 7.1% in December. Unemployment would have fallen by more in recent years if rising employment had not been partially accounted for by increased labour force participation (Chart 3.6).  That has in part reflected increased participation rates among older people, which could be related to rising longevity and to lower savings income as a result of the financial crisis.  Other factors, such as changes to government benefits and the squeeze on household incomes in recent years (Section 2), are also likely to have encouraged more people to seek work.(1) The factors contributing to a rising participation rate in recent years have more than offset demographic trends that on their own would have pulled down the participation rate significantly. Participation is expected to rise a little further in early 2014. Further falls in unemployment are likely in early 2014, as employment is likely to continue to rise by more than participation.  A range of survey measures of employment intentions rose in Q4 and suggest strong growth.  Vacancies also increased further.  And the claimant count measure of unemployment continued to fall in Q4, albeit at a slightly slower pace than in Q3.  The Bank staff projection for the headline LFS unemployment rate in Q1 is 6.9%, significantly lower than in the November Report, and below the MPC’s 7% threshold (Chart 3.5). 3.2 Indicators of spare capacity The balance between demand and supply is an important determinant of the degree of inflationary pressure.  A key judgement for the MPC is the extent to which that balance has changed, given strong output and employment growth. Slack within companies Surveys suggest that the margin of spare capacity within companies narrowed in 2013 such that companies were, on average, operating at close to normal levels of capacity utilisation (Chart 3.7).  The interpretation of these survey measures is, however, not straightforward.  Companies may have short-term notions of capacity in mind when responding to such surveys, ignoring, for example, mothballed capacity, which may require some spending to bring back into use. Moreover, while these surveys suggest that spare capacity within companies has, on average, fallen to more normal levels, most do not ask companies to quantify either current or ‘normal’ levels of capacity utilisation.  The exception is the CBI (1) Developments in the participation rate since the recession are discussed in more detail in the box on page 27 of the May 2013 Report.

Data are to 2013 Q3 and based on the 16–64 population. manufacturing survey, which suggests that manufacturers are currently operating with a capacity utilisation level of 82%, broadly in line with the pre-crisis average.  Overall, while it is difficult to map these surveys precisely into capacity utilisation, it is unlikely that spare capacity within companies is putting much pressure on inflation in either direction. Labour market slack The fall in unemployment probably overstates the fall in labour market slack — the scope for total hours worked to increase without pressure on pay.  That scope depends on: how far unemployment is above its medium-term equilibrium rate;  whether people are working fewer hours than they would like;  and whether some potential employees have been temporarily discouraged from seeking work. Unemployment probably remains above its medium-term equilibrium rate suggesting scope for it to fall without significant pressure on pay.  Bank staff’s estimate of the equilibrium rate depends on the composition of unemployment and so varies over time.(1) A key determinant is the proportion of the unemployed who have been out of work for some time.  They are likely to exert less downward pressure on wages than those who have been out of work for only a short while.  That is because people typically become more disconnected from the labour market the longer they are unemployed.  As a result, the probability of them finding a job decreases.  Based on the historical average rates at which different groups of the unemployed move into jobs, those who have been out of work for over a year have been around a third as likely to find work as those unemployed for less than six months (Chart 3.8).  The rise in long-term unemployment in 2009 was therefore associated with a rise in the medium-term equilibrium rate to around 6½%. More recently, longer-term unemployment has fallen back: around half of the fall in total unemployment between June and November 2013 was among the long and medium-term unemployed (Chart 3.9), reducing Bank staff’s estimate of the medium-term equilibrium rate to 6%–6½%.  Longer-term unemployment, and hence the medium-term equilibrium unemployment rate, is likely to continue to fall as demand recovers. There is uncertainty about the medium-term equilibrium unemployment rate.  The rate at which the long-term unemployed find work has risen since mid-2009 (Chart 3.8). The underlying rise may be overstated, in part, as it reflects participation in government-supported training and work placement schemes, which provide only temporary employment.  But even excluding those moving onto such schemes, the transition rate of the long-term unemployed, (1) For more information on equilibrium rates of unemployment, see the box on pages 28–29 of the August 2013 Inflation Report.  Section 3 Output and supply 29 relative to that of the short-term unemployed, remains above its historical average.  That suggests that the long-term unemployed may be exerting more downward pressure on wages than they did in the pre-crisis decade.  However, the transition rate of the short-term unemployed into work is below its historical average, which could indicate that they have been searching for employment less intensively and are exerting less downward pressure on wages than before the crisis. There is probably also scope for companies to increase the hours their staff work without significant pressure on pay. Average hours worked have increased fairly steadily since the 2008/09 recession for both full-time and part-time employees. At face value that suggests less slack.  But an unusually high proportion of part-time employees still say that they would prefer a full-time job (Chart 3.10).  And, according to LFS microdata, the number of hours that the currently employed would like to work, on average, has also risen (Table 3.C).  It is unclear how far these rises in ‘desired’ hours reflect an increase in the medium-term equilibrium level of average hours.  For example, it is likely that some of the rise in desired hours will unwind as the squeeze on household real incomes eases (Section 4).  Bank staff judge that much of the rise in these indicators of desired hours reflects a rise in the medium-term equilibrium level of average hours worked, and have therefore revised up their assessment of that medium-term equilibrium level since August. Other measures also suggest that slack remains, despite the recent tightening of the labour market (Chart 3.11).  For example, the proportion of temporary staff in the LFS reporting that they are in such employment because they could not find a permanent job remains above pre-crisis levels.  And vacancies remain low relative to unemployment.  The MPC also judges that the participation rate remains slightly below its medium-term equilibrium level, as some potential employees have been temporarily discouraged from looking for work. In contrast, surveys of recruitment difficulties point to tightness in some parts of the labour market.  As labour demand increases and the pool of unemployed shrinks, it can become more difficult for employers to recruit staff with the required skills.  Recruitment difficulties have become particularly apparent in some parts of the construction sector, according to contacts of the Bank’s Agents.  More generally, survey indicators suggest that recruitment difficulties and skills shortages increased in 2013 and pointed to a degree of tightness around pre-recession averages in Q4. Overall, the MPC judges that a margin of slack remains, concentrated in the labour market and largely reflecting, in roughly equal parts, unemployment and average hours being away from their medium-term equilibrium levels.  That margin is equivalent to around 1%–1½% of GDP:  the amount that it is assumed would be produced were unemployment to fall and Table 3.C Average weekly hours worked and a measure of ‘desired’ hours Averages(a) 2013 1998–2007(b) 2011 2012 Q1 Q2 Q3 Nov.(c) Average hours 32.4 31.6 31.9 32.0 32.0 32.1 32.2 Number of hours that the  currently employed would  like to work, on average(d) 32.1 32.1 32.4 32.7 32.6 32.7 n.a.

That weakness continued into 2013, despite strong growth in demand and in contrast to the MPC’s expectations of a gradual pickup. It is not clear what has constrained productivity growth in recent years.  But given the continued weakness in productivity, the MPC judges that the extent to which productivity growth will rise as a direct result of stronger demand growth is less than thought likely in August.  In particular, to the extent that weak productivity reflected businesses retaining staff who would be costly to replace, or needing a minimum level of staff to keep operating, that part of the weakness should have unwound as demand picked up.  Nevertheless, there are other reasons to expect productivity growth to pick up as the recovery progresses.  For example, as demand increases, some companies may be able to switch staff from winning business towards producing output.  More generally, as production increases, employees will become more experienced and may be better able to make efficiency gains. Productivity growth may also pick up as the lingering impact from the aftermath of the financial crisis gradually fades. Productivity growth following the crisis may have been held back by weak business investment growth and by impediments to the efficient reallocation of capital and labour from less productive businesses to more productive ones.  Both of those factors are likely to have been caused, at least in part, by tight credit conditions and elevated uncertainty about the demand outlook.  More recently, credit conditions and uncertainty have eased, although how far and how quickly that improvement feeds into higher productivity is uncertain.  Evidence on the extent of reallocation between companies is only available with a considerable delay.(1) Investment did rise in Q3 and is expected to rise further in coming quarters (Section 2).  But it will take time for that to boost productivity, as investment is small relative to the amount of existing capital. The MPC continues to expect productivity growth to pick up gradually, although there is considerable uncertainty around when that rise will occur and how large it will be (Section 5). The box on pages 46–47 presents two scenarios illustrating the potential impact on the wider economy if productivity picks up more or less quickly than in the MPC’s central judgement. (1) Company-level data suggest that productivity growth was constrained by reduced reallocation in 2010 and 2011 compared with earlier years.  Data for 2012 have only very recently become available.  See page 27 of the August 2013 Report for more details.  CPI inflation returned to the 2% target in December.  Inflation is expected to moderate further in the next few months before edging up to around the target.  Wage growth remained weak, and four-quarter unit labour cost growth fell back in 2013 Q3.  Companies’ margins still appeared squeezed.  Inflation expectations remained anchored. 4 Costs and prices Section 4 Costs and prices 31 Table 4.A Monitoring the MPC’s key judgements Developments expected in the November Report Developments since November Inflation expectations On track • Medium-term inflation expectations consistent with the 2% target. • Consistent with meeting the target. Earnings growth On track • Four-quarter AWE growth to average around 1% in 2013 H2, rising a little thereafter. • Whole-economy AWE twelve-month growth rate was 0.9% in the three months to November. Unit labour costs On track • Quarterly unit labour cost growth to be negative in Q3, then to rise to around 0.5% by mid-2014. • Quarterly unit labour cost growth was -1.4% in Q3. Commodity prices Broadly on track • Commodity prices to evolve roughly in line with paths implied by futures markets. • US dollar oil futures prices a little higher, but gas futures a little lower. Utility prices Lower than expected • Four-quarter increases in household energy prices of 9% by 2014 Q1. • Household energy prices will be around 51/@% higher in Q1 than a year earlier. CPI inflation fell to the MPC’s 2% target during 2013 Q4 for the first time in four years (Chart 4.1, Section 4.1), and wage growth remained subdued.  Inflation will be influenced by the evolution of global and import prices (Section 4.2), labour costs, and inflation expectations (Section 4.3). 4.1 Consumer prices CPI inflation fell to 2% in December, down from 2.9% at its recent June 2013 peak.  That was a faster fall than expected three months ago.  RPI inflation also fell back, but by less, so the wedge between RPI and CPI inflation, which is discussed in a box on pages 34–35, increased.  CPIH inflation — a measure of consumer price inflation that includes owner-occupiers’ housing costs — fell from 2.7% in June to 1.9% in December.(1) The decline in CPI inflation since June 2013 was accounted for by a number of factors (Chart 4.2).  The contribution from ‘other services’ prices fell by a little under 0.2 percentage points, which is likely partly to reflect weakness in labour cost growth that may persist (Section 4.3).  But the vast majority of the decline was accounted for by idiosyncratic factors.  The contribution from food and petrol prices fell, partly reflecting better harvests in 2013 than the year before and lower oil prices respectively (Section 4.2).  Airfares and clothing and footwear price inflation also slowed;  those components tend to be volatile.  In addition, there have been smaller rises than expected in administered and regulated prices, particularly tuition fees and domestic energy prices. The increase in university tuition fees implemented in October 2012 affected a second cohort of students in Autumn 2013.  Although the increase in fees was the same as the previous year, its proportionate impact on overall tuition fee expenditure was smaller as a substantial number of students were already paying the higher fees.  As a result, the contribution from education fell by around 0.2 percentage Chart 4.1 Contributions to CPI inflation(a) 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 2005 07 09 11 13 Percentage points Other(b) Electricity, gas and   other fuels Fuels and lubricants Food Education CPI inﬂation (per cent) + – (a) Quarterly contributions to annual CPI inflation.

Tuition fees are expected to contribute around 0.2 percentage points to inflation over the next 18 months, 0.1 percentage points less than previously assumed. A lower contribution from domestic energy prices accounted for around 0.1 percentage points of the fall in CPI inflation. That largely reflected a smaller overall increase in prices this year compared with last.  In the autumn, four of the six largest utility companies announced increases in prices averaging 9%. But in response to the Government announcing the removal of around £50 of policy costs from household energy bills, those companies announced cuts in prices, while the other two announced smaller price increases of around 4%.  That means that utility prices will be 51/@% higher in Q1 than a year earlier, below the assumption in the November Report (Table 4.A), and last year’s increase of around 8%.  The MPC also expects smaller future increases in domestic energy prices (Section 5). CPI inflation is expected to continue to moderate in the near term, reaching around 1.7% in March (Chart 4.3), largely on account of the smaller increases in utility prices compared with the previous year, and a further fall in petrol prices.  After that, inflation is expected to edge up to around 2%. 4.2 Global and import prices Commodity prices Commodity prices are an important influence on inflation. They affect CPI inflation directly, via household energy bills, for example, and indirectly through businesses’ costs. Energy prices have changed little since the November Report, and remain lower than they were a year ago.  US dollar oil spot prices have fallen by around 6% over the past year;  in sterling terms they have fallen by around 10% (Chart 4.4).  The futures curve has remained a little downward-sloping, perhaps reflecting expectations that disruptions to Libyan supply during 2013 may come to an end, while some of the sanctions on Iranian oil exports may be lifted.  In the run-up to the February 2014 Report, gas spot and futures prices were also a little below their levels a year earlier. Relative to a year ago, agricultural commodity and industrial metals prices were around 10% lower.  Industrial metals prices in particular are likely to have been affected by subdued growth in some emerging economies (Section 2). Non-energy import prices Import prices have been a major contributor to elevated CPI inflation since 2008.  Changes in import prices reflect developments in both foreign export prices and the sterling exchange rate.  Sterling’s depreciation in 2007–08 of more than 25% led to a sharp increase in import prices (Chart 4.5).

Section 4 Costs and prices 33 to further rises in import prices.  Although import prices were broadly flat over the first three quarters of 2013, estimates by Bank staff suggest that past rises in import prices continued to contribute to CPI inflation in Q4 (Chart 4.6). It takes time for changes in import prices to pass through into consumer prices.  The speed of pass-through varies across different goods and services.  The prices of some items, such as fresh food, tend to react quickly;  the prices of other items change only slowly, for example those with long supply chains. The extent to which a change in import prices is passed through to consumer prices is also uncertain, and will depend on the direction, size and expected persistence of that change.  For example, a survey of UK importers carried out in 2008 suggested that the probability of a change in the exchange rate being passed through increases with the size of that change.(1) Since its trough in March 2013, sterling has appreciated by almost 10%.  And foreign export price inflation has fallen (Chart 4.5), partly reflecting weak inflation in some of the United Kingdom’s main trading partners.  Both of those factors will reduce import price inflation.  Past price movements suggest that companies will eventually pass through most of the resulting fall in import prices to consumer prices, but that may take some time.  Overall, the contribution from import prices to CPI inflation is likely to fade over coming months (Section 5). 4.3 Labour costs, company profits and wage and price-setting behaviour The path of inflation depends in part on developments in companies’ labour costs, as well as on the inflation expectations of those setting prices and wages. Labour costs Wage growth has been weak since the 2008/09 recession, despite persistently above-target inflation.  Annual growth in private sector pay — both including and excluding the contribution from bonuses — was just over 1% in the year to November 2013, compared with average rates of around 4% in the years prior to the crisis (Table 4.B). Average weekly earnings (AWE) growth was volatile during 2013 and that will affect the pattern of twelve-month growth during 2014.  Some people took advantage of the prospective reduction in the top rate of UK income tax in April 2013 by deferring bonus payments and earnings from Q1 until after the reduction took effect in Q2.  Consequently, even if wages remained at their November 2013 level, annual wage growth would rise significantly in March 2014, and fall sharply the following month (Chart 4.7).  Abstracting from this short-run volatility, the outlook is for only modest rises in wages. 24 20 16 12 8 4 0 4 8 8 4 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 2003 05 07 09 11 13 Percentage change on a year earlier Sterling effective exchange   rate (left-hand scale, which   has been inverted) Import price deﬂator(a)   (right-hand scale) Percentage changes on a year earlier Foreigh export prices in   foreign currency(b)   (right-hand scale) + – + – Sources:  Bank of England, CEIC, Eurostat, ONS, Thomson Reuters Datastream and Bank calculations.

But it also monitors other measures of inflation, such as RPI.  Historically, RPI inflation has tended to be higher than CPI inflation.  The wedge between those inflation rates has fluctuated over the past (Chart A), but it is possible to estimate where it is likely to settle in the long run, when short-term shocks have washed out.  This is useful, for example, for mapping between expectations of RPI inflation derived from financial markets and CPI inflation.  This box explains Bank staff’s estimate for the long-run wedge, which is around 1.3 percentage points. The formula effect One key difference between RPI and CPI inflation is the different statistical methods used to aggregate data for the prices of individual items.  This gives rise to a difference between the two measures known as the ‘formula effect’.(1) Until 2010, the formula effect was fairly stable at around 0.5 percentage points (blue bars in Chart A). During 2010, the ONS changed how it collects clothing prices, leading to a considerable increase in their contribution to the formula effect (Chart B).(2) That change led Bank staff to revise up their estimate of the contribution of the formula effect to the long-run wedge to 0.9 percentage points (Table 1).  The decision to contemplate only routine changes to the RPI, which effectively rules out a change in the formulae used in its construction, contributed to the UK Statistics Authority’s decision to cancel the designation of the RPI as a national statistic.(3) No further methodological changes to the RPI are therefore incorporated in the staff’s estimate of the long-run wedge. Mortgage interest payments and other housing costs Mortgage interest payments (MIPs) and other housing components, such as housing depreciation and Council Tax, are included in the RPI but not the CPI.  The contribution of these to the wedge largely depends on developments in the housing market and interest rates (orange and magenta bars in Chart A). MIPs principally depend on mortgage rates charged by lenders, and the value of the mortgaged housing stock.  In the long run, interest rates should be broadly stable, so the contribution of MIPs to the wedge should depend on the change in the value of the housing stock, which also determines the contribution from housing depreciation.  To calculate the contribution of housing, a simplifying assumption is made that house prices in the long run increase in line with earnings, which have risen by around 41/@% a year on average in the past (Table 4.B). Assuming no change in the weight of housing in the RPI basket, that implies a 0.6 percentage point contribution from housing to RPI, and hence to the wedge (Table 1). Other differences in coverage and weights RPI and CPI inflation can also diverge because there are other differences in the items included in each index, and because some items have different weights in each index (green and brown bars in Chart A).  The weights used in the two indices are based on different sources.  They also capture slightly different groups of consumers.  In particular, the CPI includes all private households, whereas the RPI excludes some 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 2005 07 09 11 13 Mortgage interest payments Other housing components Other differences in coverage Formula effect Other differences including weights Total Percentage points + – Chart A Contributions to the wedge between RPI and CPI inflation Chart B Contributions to the formula effect 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 2005 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 Other items(a) Clothing and footwear Formula effect(b) Percentage points (a) Calculated as a residual.

Section 4 Costs and prices 35 households, including the highest 4% of earners and pensioners largely dependent on benefits.  And differences in coverage mean that the weights for items included in both indices differ.(4) In particular, the housing components not included in the CPI account for around 14% of the RPI;  the RPI weights for common components are consequently smaller. Since 2005, after which the split of the wedge into its components is based on the ONS’s preferred methodology, these other differences in weights and coverage have contributed on average around -0.5 percentage points to the wedge.  But that partly reflects increases in energy and import prices, tuition fees and VAT, which have a smaller weight in the RPI than in the CPI, and so boosted RPI inflation by less than CPI inflation.  In the long run, these items are expected to grow at rates consistent with CPI inflation at the 2% target, and the contribution from other differences to the wedge is expected to fall to -0.2 percentage points. External estimates Based on these assumptions, Bank staff estimate the long-run RPI-CPI wedge to be around 1.3 percentage points.  That is similar to the Office for Budget Responsibility’s estimate of 1.3 to 1.5 percentage points.(5) Although discussions with market participants suggest that the long-run wedge priced into inflation breakevens is a little lower than the Bank staff estimate, at around 0.9 to 1 percentage points on average.

Evidence from a recent survey by the Bank’s Agents suggests that wage growth will remain muted beyond Q1.  Respondents expected annual pay settlements — which account for a large proportion of total earnings growth — to be only slightly higher in 2014 than in 2013.  Retention and recruitment of staff were reported to be bolstering total labour costs relative to last year, while inflation expectations were reported to be pushing down.  Some indicators point to a greater strengthening in pay pressures.  For example, in December, the REC survey rose to its highest level since October 2007 (Table 4.C), and remained there in January, although that only captures the salaries of those who have recently started a job, rather than all employees.  More generally, surveys have tended to point to stronger earnings growth than the official data for some time. The key factors influencing wages over the medium term are productivity and slack in the labour market (Chart 4.8). Productivity growth has been unusually weak since the 2008/09 recession.  And despite recent falls, slack is estimated to remain (Section 3).  These have both depressed wage growth. As labour market slack falls and productivity growth picks up, wage growth is likely to recover.  The extent to which higher wages affect prices partly depends on the extent to which unit labour cost growth increases as a result.  In the period since the 2008/09 recession, wages have adjusted slowly to the weakness in productivity, such that private sector unit labour cost growth has been relatively robust, averaging around its pre-crisis average rate (Chart 4.9).  In Q3, four-quarter growth in unit labour costs fell back, broadly as expected in the November Report.  If wages rise broadly in line with productivity, unit labour cost growth will remain subdued (Section 5). 4 2 0 2 4 5 3 1 1 3 6 Jan. Apr. July Oct. Jan. Apr. July Oct. Jan. Apr.

This guidance will cease to hold if any of three knockouts are breached.  One of these knockouts relates to whether medium-term inflation expectations remain sufficiently well anchored.  The MPC has three main metrics for monitoring the risks to inflation expectations:  the level of inflation expectations;  uncertainty about inflation;  and the sensitivity to unexpected economic developments. As in November, the level of inflation expectations appears consistent with the 2% target.  There remains some evidence that expectations derived from financial markets have been more sensitive to news about the economy over the past year than before the financial crisis, but that sensitivity to news has fallen a little at longer horizons.  Overall, the MPC continues to judge that medium-term inflation expectations remain sufficiently well anchored. The level of inflation expectations At the one-year horizon, developments in indicators of households’ inflation expectations have been mixed since the November Report (Table 1).  The Bank/NOP one year ahead measure picked up in the November 2013 survey, rising further above its pre-crisis average.  But other indicators fell or were unchanged. Some measures of households’ inflation expectations at the two to three and five to ten-year horizons picked up between Q3 and Q4.  Those increases occurred around the time that several utility companies announced price rises.  The more timely monthly YouGov/Citigroup measure fell in January — completely unwinding its October pickup, which probably reflected the utility price increases.  Overall, most medium-term household measures remain close to past averages.  Professional forecasters’ expectations were also close to historical averages in Q1. Indicators of inflation expectations implied from financial instruments that reference RPI inflation — such as inflation swaps — have changed little since the November Report. An indicator of expected inflation three years ahead was around 3% in the run-up to the February Report, and five to ten year ahead expected inflation was 3.5% (Table 1). These indicators reflect not only expected CPI inflation but also market participants’ views about the future wedge between RPI and CPI inflation, together with a risk premium to compensate for factors such as uncertainty about future inflation.  Market contacts estimate the long-run RPI-CPI wedge priced in to breakevens to be around 0.9 to 1 percentage points on average.

Section 4 Costs and prices 37 Company profits and business pricing intentions The latest ONS data on the private sector corporate profit share suggest that companies’ profit margins have remained compressed following the 2008/09 recession.  A survey by the Bank’s Agents conducted in mid-2013 also indicated that profit margins have been squeezed in aggregate, although there were significant differences across companies and sectors.  In particular, the survey suggested that the profits of export-facing businesses had been supported by the sterling depreciation.(1) But sterling’s appreciation since March 2013 may have put downward pressure on exporters’ margins. It is likely that companies will eventually need to rebuild their margins to deliver sufficiently attractive returns to investors. Some of the increase in margins could occur through a reallocation of resources towards more profitable businesses. But it could also happen through larger increases in prices, smaller increases in costs, or a combination of the two. Inflation expectations The rate at which companies raise prices partly depends on their inflation expectations.  For example, if businesses expect higher price rises by their competitors, perhaps as a result of stronger overall inflation, they may be more inclined to make larger price increases themselves.  Companies’ near-term expectations for the change in their own prices, and prices in their industry more generally, have been broadly stable over the past year. More generally, as discussed in a box on pages 36–37, the MPC judges that medium-term inflation expectations remain sufficiently well anchored.  Movements in measures of medium-term expectations of households, financial market participants and professional forecasters have been mixed, but most are close to past averages.

A box on pages 34–35 sets out Bank staff’s estimate of the long-run wedge. Uncertainty Market-based measures of uncertainty about expected inflation have fallen a little over the past three months.  But they remain higher than in 2008. Sensitivity to news There remains some tentative evidence that inflation expectations derived from financial markets are more sensitive to news than a few years ago, but at the seven to ten-year horizon, that sensitivity has moderated since the time of the November Report.  One way of assessing this sensitivity is to examine how these measures of inflation expectations change in response to unexpected movements in CPI inflation on the day of publication.  The magenta diamonds in Chart A show the change in expected inflation at different horizons following CPI data releases between January 2013 and December 2013 relative to the average changes in response to CPI news between 2004 and 2007;  the green diamonds show the equivalent coefficients at the time of the November Report. Over the past twelve months, inflation expectations appear to have been a little more responsive to CPI data news than they were between 2004 and 2007, but that change in sensitivity is very small relative to the uncertainty around it (Chart A).  And at longer horizons that responsiveness has declined since the November Report.  38 Inflation Report  February 2014 5 Prospects for inflation The UK recovery has gained momentum and unemployment has fallen faster than expected.  The recovery to date has been underpinned by a revival in confidence, a reduction in uncertainty and an easing in credit conditions.  It is sustained over the forecast period as productivity and real income growth revive.   CPI inflation has returned to the 2% target sooner than expected.  Upward pressure from import and administered and regulated prices remains, but slack is providing a countervailing force.  Over the forecast period, upward price pressures fade, slack is gradually absorbed, and inflation remains at, or a little below, the target. 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 2009 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Percentage increases in output on a year earlier Projection   Bank estimates of past growth ONS data   + – The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for GDP growth.  It has been conditioned on the assumption that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remains at £375 billion throughout the forecast period.  To the left of the vertical dashed line, the distribution reflects the likelihood of revisions to the data over the past; to the right, it reflects uncertainty over the evolution of GDP growth in the future.  If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that the mature estimate of GDP growth would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of those occasions.  The fan chart is constructed so that outturns are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter green areas on 30 occasions.  In any particular quarter of the forecast period, GDP growth is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fan on 90 out of 100 occasions.  And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions GDP growth can fall anywhere outside the green area of the fan chart.  Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey background.  See the box on page 39 of the November 2007 Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.   Chart 5.1 GDP projection based on market interest rate expectations and £375 billion purchased assets Output has continued to recover.  That recovery has been associated with a faster fall in unemployment than the MPC expected:  unemployment was 7.1% in November and is likely to reach the 7% threshold by the spring of this year. The outlook for inflation and growth depends on how much slack remains and, crucially, on the strength of the prospective pickup in productivity growth.  Even when the economy has returned to normal levels of capacity and inflation is close to the target, the appropriate level of Bank Rate is likely to be materially below the 5% level set, on average, by the Committee prior to the financial crisis (see the box on page 40). Four-quarter GDP growth has risen over the past year as uncertainty has lifted and credit conditions have eased (Chart 5.1).  Under the assumptions that Bank Rate moves in line with a path implied by market interest rates (Chart 1.1 on page 10) and of a constant stock of purchased assets, growth eases a little as the initial fillip from the release of pent-up demand fades, but picks up further out as global activity and business investment strengthen.(1)  The recovery has been associated with some absorption of economic slack.  The MPC judges that a margin of slack, probably around 1%–1½% of GDP, remains, concentrated in the labour market.  A prospective pickup in productivity growth means that slack is absorbed only slowly and some remains at the forecast horizon. (1) The projections are also conditioned on:  the Government’s tax and spending plans as set out in the December 2013 Autumn Statement;  commodity prices following market paths;  and the sterling effective exchange rate remaining around its level in the ﬁfteen working day average to 5 February 2014 of 85.6, which is around 3½% above the November starting point.  The main assumptions are set out in a table available at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/inﬂationreport/ 2014/ir14febca.pdf.  Section 5 Prospects for inflation 39 CPI inflation has fallen back to the 2% target.  Under the same assumptions as Chart 5.1, inflation is at, or a little below, the target throughout the forecast period (Chart 5.2), as a waning contribution from import and administered and regulated prices outweighs the lessening drag from slack.  The projection is lower than in November (Chart 5.3) in the near term, reflecting unexpectedly low outturns, smaller rises in utility prices than the MPC had assumed, and the appreciation of sterling.  Further out, a lower contribution from import and administered and regulated prices is broadly offset by a reduced drag from slack (Chart 5.4). 5.1 Key judgements and risks The Committee’s projections are underpinned by four key judgements, set out below.  Table 5.A sets out the projections for variables that illustrate these judgements.  Risks surround these judgements, and Table 5.B provides a range of indicators to monitor them in the near term.    Key Judgement 1:  headwinds to growth in advanced economies continue to wane, such that global growth recovers slowly to around its historical average rate  The MPC’s November judgement that a recovery in the advanced economies would drive a gradual strengthening in global growth remains broadly on track, although tensions have increased in some emerging economies.  The MPC’s central view is for advanced-economy growth to rise gradually and emerging-economy growth to remain at around current rates, such that annual growth in world activity reaches 4% by 2016 in PPP-weighted terms and a little under 3% in UK trade-weighted terms (Table 5.A).  The risks around global growth are judged to be more balanced than in recent years.   2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 2009 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Percentage increase in prices on a year earlier     – + Chart 5.2 CPI inflation projection based on market interest rate expectations and £375 billion purchased assets 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 2009 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Percentage increase in prices on a year earlier     + – 17 Chart 5.3 CPI inflation projection in November based on market interest rate expectations and £375 billion purchased assets Charts 5.2 and 5.3 depict the probability of various outcomes for CPI inflation in the future.  They have been conditioned on the assumption that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remains at £375 billion throughout the forecast period.  If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that inflation in any particular quarter would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of those occasions.  The fan charts are constructed so that outturns of inflation are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter red areas on 30 occasions.  In any particular quarter of the forecast period, inflation is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fans on 90 out of 100 occasions.  And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions inflation can fall anywhere outside the red area of the fan chart. Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey background.  See the box on pages 48–49 of the May 2002 Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.  0 20 40 60 80 100 17  Q2 Q2 Q2 Q4 Q3 Q3 Q4 Q4 Q1 Q1 Q1 Q3 2014 15 16 Q1 Per cent   February November Chart 5.4 Probability that inflation will be above the target The February and November swathes in this chart are derived from the same distributions as Charts 5.2 and 5.3 respectively.  They indicate the assessed probability of inflation being above target in each quarter of the forecast period.  The 5 percentage points width of the swathes reflects the fact that there is uncertainty about the precise probability in any given quarter, but they should not be interpreted as confidence intervals.    40 Inflation Report  February 2014 Annual euro-area growth is likely to pick up gradually, but to remain well below its pre-crisis average rate (Table 5.A), reflecting the challenges still facing the periphery.  The risks posed by those challenges have, on balance, diminished a little. Most periphery countries’ government bond yields have fallen since November, improving debt dynamics and reducing bank funding costs.  Moreover, periphery countries have improved their competitiveness, and activity indicators have risen more than anticipated.  An associated revival in confidence could engender a faster recovery than in the central case.  That would be more likely if the ECB’s forthcoming assessment of banks’ balance sheets bolsters confidence in the euro-area banking system.  But the rebalancing challenges within the area could prove more difficult if recent low rates of overall euro-area inflation persist, as the necessary further changes in competitiveness between countries will be harder to achieve. Bank Rate in the medium term Even if the economy were operating at normal levels of capacity, the level of interest rates needed to keep inflation close to the target and to maintain demand in line with supply would vary over time.  In the immediate aftermath of the global financial crisis, this rate — which can be thought of as the equilibrium interest rate — fell sharply and became negative, reflecting the scale of the balance sheet adjustment necessary and the sharp increase in uncertainty.  Although it is difficult to estimate the equilibrium rate with any precision, it has probably risen recently as economic conditions have improved and is likely to increase further as the economic headwinds ease over the forecast period.  Nonetheless, the legacy of the financial crisis means that the equilibrium rate is likely to remain unusually low for a considerable period. The financial crisis also caused demand to fall substantially below the economy’s potential supply, meaning that the policy rate needed to stimulate the economy and close the margin of spare capacity was even lower than the equilibrium rate.  At the same time, the MPC also needed to ensure that inflation remained on track to hit the inflation target in the medium term.  Bank Rate was cut to 0.5% and, in view of the effective lower bound for Bank Rate, the MPC engaged in asset purchases to provide further monetary stimulus.  As the equilibrium rate increases and the recovery progresses such that the margin of spare capacity is absorbed, Bank Rate will need to increase gradually.  However, even when the economy is operating at normal levels of capacity and inflation is close to the target, the factors continuing to push down the equilibrium interest rate mean that Bank Rate is likely to be materially below the 5% level set on average by the Committee prior to the crisis. This is evident in the MPC’s projections for economic growth and inflation.  Conditioned on the assumption that Bank Rate rises in line with a path implied by market yields, the MPC expects that in three years’ time the economy will be close to, though a little below, normal capacity and that inflation will be close to the target.  At that point, market yields imply that Bank Rate will be around 2%, materially below its average historical rate.  Market interest rates also currently imply that Bank Rate is expected to remain in the range of 2%–3% for some while beyond the forecast horizon.  Although the future path of interest rates is very uncertain, there are several reasons to think that the equilibrium rate — and hence Bank Rate — may remain low by historical standards for some time to come: • A number of headwinds to demand are likely to persist beyond the three-year forecast horizon.  For example, the Government plans to continue to reduce the structural budget deficit for several more years, and growth in euro-area demand may continue to fall short of its pre-crisis average. • Although there has been a recent and welcome improvement in credit availability, it seems likely that interest rate spreads on loans will remain substantially higher than their unsustainably compressed levels before the financial crisis. • On a broader level, the United Kingdom’s financial openness means that interest rates here are linked to global interest rates, which displayed a pronounced downward trend in the years preceding the financial crisis.(1) This was partly the result of a rise in savings by emerging economies, which reinforced the downward pressure from subdued investment demand in the advanced economies.  These developments are unlikely to reverse quickly.  (1) For a discussion of the measurement of the world interest rate and measures of implied future real interest rates, see King, M and Low, D (2014), ‘Measuring the ‘world’ real interest rate’, NBER Working Paper No. 19887.  Section 5 Prospects for inflation 41 The risk of a disorderly outcome is judged to have lessened, but, as in previous Reports, the direct effects of such an outcome are excluded from the fan charts.   US growth has continued at a solid pace.  The drag from fiscal consolidation is expected to wane in 2014, in part reflecting the agreement on the federal budget.  GDP is expected to grow at around historical average rates (Table 5.A), supported by an improving labour market.   Some emerging economies have experienced further sharp outflows of capital and currency depreciations since the November Report.  Those tensions have been associated with country-specific factors, but a number of countries with large current account deficits and high inflation remain very sensitive to developments elsewhere, including US monetary policy.  A risk of a sharp slowdown in these economies and contagion to others therefore remains, along with the risk of a marked slowing in China, perhaps prompted by a fall in credit growth.  A slowdown in emerging economies would probably have limited direct implications for UK exports but indirect trade linkages or more widespread financial market disruption could lead to a more significant impact. The recovery in the United Kingdom’s main overseas markets should feed through to higher UK exports.  But the support to exports from sterling has lessened following its appreciation over the past year.  In the central view, export growth is expected to pick up to a little above its pre-crisis average rate. That is associated with UK exporters’ share of world trade continuing to fall.  There is uncertainty around that profile:  for example, some of the post-crisis weakness in services exports could unwind over the forecast period (see the box on pages 24–25 of the February 2013 Report). Key Judgement 2:  domestically, the revival in confidence and improving credit conditions aid the broadening of the recovery from household to business spending   The recovery to date has been supported by a revival in confidence and a dissipation of uncertainty.  It has also reflected easing credit conditions, which are assumed to continue to improve over the forecast period (Table 5.A), supporting a further pickup in lending.  That said, the spreads charged over reference rates on household and company loans are likely to remain higher than their unsustainably compressed levels before the financial crisis (see the box on pages 16–17).  The impact of the past reduction in uncertainty and easing in credit conditions has, so far, been much more apparent in household than company spending.  In the central projection, the pattern seen over the past year of households funding consumption growth by saving less, in the face of little income growth, continues this year (Table 5.A).  But households cannot cut back on saving indefinitely;  longer-term consumption growth depends on income growth picking up.

But the income recovery is muted and consumption grows below its pre-crisis average rate in the second half of the forecast period.  The main risk to consumption stems from productivity:  the box on pages 46–47 shows that faster (slower) productivity growth leads to faster (slower) growth in income and hence consumption.  There are also risks associated with households’ saving.  For example, if some The Committee’s projections are underpinned by four key judgements.  Risks surround all of these, and the MPC will monitor a broad range of indicators to assess the degree to which the risks are crystallising.  The table below provides guidance on the likely path for the indicators if the judgements in the MPC’s central view evolve as expected.     Table 5.B Monitoring risks to the Committee’s key judgements Key judgement Likely developments in 2014 H1 and Q3 if judgements evolve as expected 1:  headwinds to growth in advanced economies continue to wane, such that global growth recovers slowly to around its historical average rate • Quarterly euro-area GDP growth of a little above ¼%, with sovereign bond yields and indicators of bank funding costs broadly stable.  • Quarterly US GDP growth averaging a little below ¾% and non-farm payrolls increasing by a little over 200,000 per month. • Indicators of activity consistent with four-quarter PPP-weighted emerging-economy growth averaging around 5% and, within that, Chinese GDP growth averaging around 7¾%. • UK exports to grow at around 1% per quarter on average in the year to 2014 Q3. 2:  domestically, the revival in confidence and improving credit conditions aid the broadening of the recovery from household to business spending • Quarterly consumer spending growth of around ¾% in the year to 2014 Q3. • Indicators of business investment consistent with average quarterly growth rates of around 3% in the year to 2014 Q3.  • Housing investment to strengthen over the next year, averaging growth of around 5% a quarter. • A rise in mortgage approvals for house purchase to around 80,000 a month in 2014 Q1, reaching around 90,000 by 2014 Q3. • Near-term rises in the average of Halifax and Nationwide house price indices to be similar to increases seen in recent months. • Four-quarter PNFC net lending to be slightly positive in 2014 Q1, and rise further in subsequent quarters.  • Credit spreads continue to decline over 2014, particularly for high loan to value mortgages and loans to smaller companies. 3:  growth in the economy’s supply capacity picks up gradually, such that slack is absorbed only slowly as demand recovers • Headline LFS unemployment rate to decline by a further ½ percentage point by 2014 Q3. • The labour market participation rate to rise gently during 2014 H1.   • Average hours worked continue to rise in 2014 but at a slower pace than over the past year. • Indicators of spare capacity within companies to show little intensification of capacity pressures. • Four-quarter growth in hourly labour productivity to rise to around 1% by 2014 Q3. 4:  upward pressure from external prices fades but the drag from slack lessens, so that inflation stays close to the target • Medium-term indicators of household and financial market inflation expectations continuing to be consistent with the 2% target (see the box on page 36–37). • Headline four-quarter AWE growth to be around 2% by 2014 Q3 following some volatility in 2014 H1. • Unit labour costs to remain broadly flat in 2013 Q4 and 2014 Q1 before picking up to quarterly growth of around 0.5% by 2014 Q3. • Sterling ERI, domestic energy bills and commodity prices evolve in line with the conditioning assumptions. • Import prices to fall by a little over 1% in 2014 H1.  Section 5 Prospects for inflation 43 households have based spending decisions on expectations of unrealistically rapid income growth, they could rein in spending as they realise that income is rising only slowly.  That might particularly be the case for highly indebted households.   The housing market revival has continued, in line with the MPC’s expectation in the November Report (Section 1).  Most surveys suggest that recent rates of house price increases will continue in the short term.  Although the outlook is uncertain, house prices are assumed to rise broadly in line with nominal incomes further out.  Higher housing activity and prices provide only modest support to consumption in the central view (see the box on pages 20–21 of the November 2013 Report).  But housing investment boosts GDP growth significantly over the first two years of the forecast.  The housing market recovery could begin to create risks to financial stability if accompanied by substantial and rapid rises in house prices and a further build-up in household debt.  In the November Financial Stability Report, the Financial Policy Committee noted that several actions were in train that should mitigate the build-up of such vulnerabilities.  It also noted that it had an extensive toolkit that it could deploy as part of a proportionate and graduated response to evolving housing market risks, should further steps become necessary.  With household spending growth slowing and the global economy recovering only gradually, business spending needs to pick up the baton of growth if the pace of expansion is to be maintained.  Business investment has so far remained weak even as activity has risen.  That is not surprising — companies are likely to use up spare capacity before investing and may need to see a sustained recovery in demand before having the confidence to make decisions that are costly to reverse.  But demand and financial conditions have become increasingly conducive to investment:  large companies have good access to credit;  and, in aggregate, companies appear to have healthy balance sheets.  Indeed, investment intentions surveys point to robust growth in capital spending.  In the central projection, investment growth picks up to over 10% a year, and the investment to GDP ratio rises markedly (Table 5.A).  There are risks around that outlook on both sides stemming from the risks to productivity growth.  But, overall the risks are probably skewed to the investment recovery being slower to come through.  For example, even though credit conditions are likely to ease somewhat over the forecast period, many smaller companies’ investment may still be constrained by difficulties accessing credit. Key Judgement 3:  growth in the economy’s supply capacity picks up gradually, such that slack is absorbed only slowly as demand recovers  Economic slack has been absorbed faster than expected.  In the November Report, the MPC assumed that companies would work existing resources more intensively before stepping up recruitment.  But survey indicators suggest that companies are  44 Inflation Report  February 2014 not far from operating at normal capacity, and employment has grown strongly (Section 3).  That has been associated with lower unemployment:  LFS unemployment is likely to reach the MPC’s 7% threshold by the spring of this year, much earlier than judged likely three months ago. The fall in unemployment probably overstates the fall in labour market slack — the scope for total hours worked to increase without pressure on pay.  That scope depends on:  how far unemployment is above its medium-term equilibrium level; whether people are working fewer hours than they would like; and whether there are some potential employees who have been temporarily discouraged from looking for work.  The fall in unemployment has been accompanied by a small downward revision to Bank staff’s estimate of the medium-term equilibrium unemployment rate, which is now judged to be between 6% and 6½%.  That reflects the fact that the long-term unemployed — who are assumed to put less downward pressure on wages than the short-term unemployed — have accounted for a substantial share of the fall in unemployment.  There also appears to be scope for companies to increase hours worked without much pressure on pay: although average hours have been rising, the hours people want to work are higher — for example, many part-timers say that they would like a full-time job (Section 3).  Indeed, the MPC now judges that although average hours have risen more than expected, there was more slack in average hours in Q4 than was assumed in the August 2013 projections.  In addition, labour market participation is judged to be a little below its potential level.   The MPC judges that a margin of slack — probably around 1%–1½% of GDP — still remains within the economy.  That is concentrated in the labour market, with unemployment and average hours both somewhat away from their medium-term equilibrium levels.  There is considerable uncertainty around those judgements and a range of opinions on the Committee. In particular, equilibrium unemployment and hours cannot be observed, only imperfectly inferred.  And it is difficult to judge whether recent movements are likely to persist or not — for example, higher desired hours could reflect a temporary response to the squeeze on real incomes. The speed at which slack is absorbed depends crucially on the extent to which productivity growth picks up.  Productivity appears to have grown more slowly than hoped as demand has recovered, even taking account of the upward revisions to growth in the MPC’s central backcast.  As in November, the MPC judges that productivity growth will gradually pick up, but will only reach its pre-crisis average rate in the third year of the projection (Table 5.A).  That would be much stronger growth than in recent years, but the gap between productivity and a continuation of its pre-recession trend would nevertheless continue to widen.    Section 5 Prospects for inflation 45 There are a number of reasons to expect productivity growth to rise, although there is considerable uncertainty around the timing and extent of any rise.  As demand recovers, companies may be able to redeploy some staff from winning business towards producing output.  Companies may make productivity advances through learning by doing as production returns to more normal rates.  Easier credit conditions and lower uncertainty should facilitate the movement of capital and labour towards more productive companies.  The recovery in business investment will also support productivity.  The central projection puts little weight on mechanisms that imply rapid catch-up in productivity as demand recovers, for example as companies adopt a backlog of innovations and technical advances.  Indeed, the continued weakness in productivity has caused the MPC to revise down its assessment of the extent to which productivity responds to increases in demand.  But there are risks on both sides of the productivity profile:  the box on pages 46–47 illustrates the impact of alternative assumptions that productivity either increases more rapidly than in the central case or else stagnates.  In the central projection, the slow rise in productivity growth is associated with continued, but slowing, growth in labour demand and some reduction in economic slack.  In particular, existing staff work more hours (Table 5.A), such that the gap between actual and desired hours gradually closes.  The participation rate also rises towards its equilibrium level (Table 5.A).  And the unemployment rate falls.  That fall is modest relative to recent experience as the pickup in productivity growth slows growth in hiring.  Moreover, the medium-term equilibrium rate also declines a little further, as more of the longer-term unemployed find jobs.  Overall, in the central case, slack is not fully absorbed over the forecast period.  There is, however, considerable uncertainty about its evolution.   Key Judgement 4:  upward pressure from external prices fades but the drag from slack lessens, so that inflation stays close to the target  CPI inflation fell back to the 2% target in December 2013, following four years above it.  The decline since mid-2013 was faster than expected.  Although that appears largely to reflect idiosyncratic factors that had been pushing up inflation abating more quickly than expected (Section 4), it is possible that it signals a greater easing in underlying price pressures.   At the start of the forecast period, slack exerts downward pressure on inflation, but that downward pressure diminishes as slack is absorbed.  That is reflected in higher wages, such that unit labour cost growth is expected to pick up from the second half of 2014, although it remains well below its  pre-crisis average rate.  Companies’ labour costs are kept in check by the gradual increase in productivity growth, which allows wages to rise without generating much inflationary pressure.   46 Inflation Report  February 2014 The impact of alternative paths for labour productivity Labour productivity growth has been unusually weak since the 2008/09 recession (Section 3), such that productivity in 2013 Q3 was around 16% below the level implied by an extrapolation of its pre-crisis trend.  The reasons for that weakness remain uncertain.  The MPC judges that productivity growth is likely to pick up gradually towards its pre-crisis average rate (Table 1).  Productivity growth could, however, be either stronger or weaker than the MPC expects.  This box shows that, under certain assumptions, higher (or lower) productivity would:  • lead to higher (or lower) GDP and real wages;  and • have only a modest impact on inflation and unemployment. Alternative productivity paths This box illustrates two alternative paths for productivity. On the higher path, productivity accelerates more than in the central case;  it is around 51/@% higher than the MPC’s central judgement at the three-year forecast horizon.  Since productivity growth on this higher path is at or above its pre-crisis average for much of the forecast period (Table 1), the shortfall in productivity relative to its pre-crisis trend decreases to around 13%, compared with an increasing shortfall in the central case.  On the lower path, productivity does not grow at all over the forecast period, continuing the unprecedented weakness of the past few years (Table 1).  The level of productivity in this case is around 51/@% lower than the MPC’s central judgement after three years. The impact of higher or lower productivity on GDP, unemployment and inflation is estimated using the Bank’s suite of forecasting models, under the assumption that market interest rates respond to macroeconomic developments as they have in the past.(1) These scenarios are mirror images of each other, and the responses are symmetric, so only the higher-productivity scenario is described in detail. Impact on GDP, unemployment and inflation Productivity is a key determinant of real wages (Section 4). Higher productivity, relative to the central case, is reflected in higher real wages.  Real wages are assumed to rise eventually by the same amount as productivity, with around half of the adjustment taking place by the forecast horizon.  That real wage adjustment comes mostly through higher nominal wage growth rather than lower inflation. Some households will probably not raise their spending until their income rises, say because they have limited savings or poor access to credit.  But other households are likely to be able to raise spending in anticipation of higher future income.(2) As these households see productivity rising more quickly than expected, they revise up their view of future income and, therefore, raise current spending.  That higher spending is financed, initially, through saving less or borrowing more.  Investment also rises, relative to the central case, as companies anticipate increased future demand, and as higher productivity boosts profits.  Overall, four-quarter GDP growth averages nearly 11/@ percentage points higher than in the MPC’s modal projection (Chart A). Because higher productivity is largely matched by higher demand, employment is a little lower and unemployment a little higher than in the MPC’s central projection;  after three years, the unemployment rate is 0.5 percentage points higher than the central projection. Unit labour costs are little changed in the long run, as productivity and wages rise by similar amounts.  But, over the forecast period, unit labour costs are lower than in the central case because the rise in wages lags the rise in productivity. That reduces CPI inflation, relative to the central projection, but the overall response of inflation is small (Chart B), especially in comparison with the significantly stronger demand profile.  Indeed, the GDP growth path in this higher-productivity scenario rises to the outer band of the MPC’s fan chart, whereas the associated path of CPI inflation lies within the central band.  Since the inflation outlook is only Table 1 Alternative paths for labour productivity Projections 1998–2007 2013(a) 2014 2015 2016 average Whole-economy per hour,  calendar-year growth February 2014 central projection 2½ 0 1 1¼ 2 Higher-productivity scenario 2½ 0 1¾ 2¾ 4 Lower-productivity scenario 2½ 0 ¼ 0 0 (a) Data are available to 2013 Q3.  2013 Q4 is a Bank staff projection.

Section 5 Prospects for inflation 47 a little lower than the central case, market interest rates are also only a little lower than in the central case. Sensitivities The precise impact of higher productivity on GDP, unemployment and inflation depends on exactly how companies and households respond.  In particular, a smaller demand response to higher productivity would be associated with a larger impact on unemployment and inflation.  The demand response would be smaller if households are less forward looking or more credit constrained.  In either case, they would be less likely to increase their spending before receiving higher income. Whether or not productivity is higher in response to other macroeconomic developments also matters.  In this box, higher productivity is assumed to be unrelated to such developments, say because it results from some new technology.  If higher productivity were itself a response to other macroeconomic developments, then its impact would be different. The impact of higher productivity on inflation also depends on how costly it is to change prices relative to nominal wages.  For example, many companies change prices infrequently, because of the costs involved.(3) Similarly, companies and employees only agree wages periodically.  If it were less costly to change prices or more costly to change wages than assumed in the scenarios, there would be a bigger inflation impact. Conclusion The unprecedented weakness in productivity growth in recent years remains puzzling.  The outlook for productivity is uncertain, but productivity is a key determinant of the growth rate of the economy consistent with inflation staying close to the 2% target.  These scenarios show that, under certain assumptions, faster (or slower) productivity growth can generate faster (or slower) real wage and demand growth, with only limited implications for inflation.

(1) These scenarios were produced assuming unanticipated labour-augmenting productivity shocks, such that productivity is persistently higher or lower than in the central projection, even beyond the forecast horizon.  The response of market interest rates to macroeconomic developments was proxied using an estimated Taylor rule. For more information about the Bank’s central forecasting model and range of supporting models, see Burgess, S, Fernandez-Corugedo, E, Groth, C, Harrison, R, Monti, F, Theodoridis, K and Waldron, M (2013), ‘The Bank of England’s forecasting platform:  COMPASS, MAPS, EASE and the suite of models’, Bank of England Working Paper No. 471. (2) Around three quarters of consumer spending is assumed to be based on both current and future income.  See Burgess et al (2013) op. cit. for more information. (3) Previous Bank research has examined companies’ price-setting behaviour using survey information and company-level data.  See, for example, Greenslade, J and Parker, M (2010), ‘New insights into price-setting behaviour in the United Kingdom’, Bank of England Working Paper No. 395, and Bunn, P and Ellis, C (2012), ‘Examining the behaviour of individual UK consumer prices’, The Economic Journal, Vol. 122, Issue 558, pages F35–F55. In the central case, companies’ capacity utilisation remains close to normal, putting little pressure on inflation in either direction.  Companies are, however, expected to rebuild margins, which appear to have been squeezed in aggregate.  A modest rebuild occurs through moderate labour cost growth and inflation around the target.  It is possible that some companies will try to gain market share as demand increases, by charging lower prices and accepting lower profits for a while.  But others may seek to rebuild margins more quickly. Price-setting behaviour also depends on inflation expectations: the MPC continues to judge that inflation expectations remain sufficiently well anchored (see the box on pages 36–37).  The waning drag from slack is offset by a smaller contribution from those factors that have been raising inflation. Administered and regulated prices now appear likely to contribute less over the forecast period, both compared with the recent past and with previous Report projections.  That mainly reflects a smaller contribution to domestic utility prices Table 5.C Calendar-year GDP growth rates Mode Median Mean 2014 3.4 (2.9) 3.4 (2.8) 3.4 (2.8) 2015 2.7 (2.5) 2.7 (2.3) 2.7 (2.3) 2016 2.9 (2.7) 2.8 (2.5) 2.8 (2.5) The table shows projections for calendar-year growth of real GDP consistent with the respective modal, median and mean projections for four-quarter growth of real GDP.  The numbers in parentheses show the corresponding projections in the November 2013 Inflation Report.  The February and November projections have been conditioned on market interest rates, and the assumption that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remains at £375 billion throughout the forecast period.  Where growth rates depend in part on the MPC’s backcast, revisions to quarterly growth are assumed to be independent of the revisions to previous quarters.  48 Inflation Report  February 2014 from non-energy costs in light of recent Government and regulatory announcements (Section 4):  no further rises in utility prices are expected this year and these prices are expected to rise by only 2½% in the second and third years of the forecast.  There remains considerable uncertainty around the outlook for both wholesale energy prices and non-energy costs.  The contribution of import costs to CPI inflation — which was probably a little over ½ percentage point at the end of 2013 — is also likely to fall.  In both the United States and euro area, measures of core inflation are close to 1%.  Foreign export prices were flat in 2013.  Commodity prices have fallen in dollar terms, with metals prices down more than 10% over the past year and oil prices 6% lower.  Moreover, the sterling appreciation of around 10% since its March 2013 trough will bear down on UK import prices.  Over the forecast period, lower import prices (Table 5.A) are slowly passed through to consumer prices, and their contribution to CPI inflation turns negative.  The risks to global prices are skewed a little to the downside, in view of the possibility of more persistent disinflationary pressures in some advanced economies and the downward pressure on commodity prices that would result from a slowing in emerging economies.  There is also uncertainty about import price pass-through — as in November, not all of the fall in import prices is assumed to feed through to consumer prices.   5.2 The projections for demand, unemployment and inflation  Based on the judgements above, and the risks around them, four-quarter GDP growth is expected to pick up in the near term as the lifting of uncertainty and easing credit conditions continue to help release pent-up demand (Chart 5.1).  As that boost fades, growth moderates, before rising again as global activity strengthens and business investment recovers (Table 5.C).  The profile for growth is a little higher than in the November Report.  In the near term that reflects revisions to data and the momentum in survey outturns and, further out, a slightly larger boost from the easing in credit conditions (Chart 5.5).  There is a range of views on the Committee on the risks to the projections.  Overall, the risks to GDP growth are judged to be balanced in the near term but skewed to the downside further out, reflecting the possibility that the recovery may fail to get onto a firmer footing, for example, if business investment growth is slow to pick up. Unemployment is likely to reach the MPC’s 7% threshold by the spring of this year (Chart 5.6).  The unemployment rate falls further over the forecast period, as productivity growth picks up more slowly than output growth.  The profile is considerably lower than in the November Report, reflecting recent unexpectedly low outturns:  the fall in unemployment from 2014 Q1 onwards is similar.

It has been conditioned on the assumption that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remains at £375 billion throughout the forecast period.  If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that the mature estimate of unemployment would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of those occasions.  The fan chart is constructed so that outturns are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter blue areas on 30 occasions.  In any particular quarter of the forecast period, unemployment is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fan on 90 out of 100 occasions.  And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions unemployment can fall anywhere outside the blue area of the fan chart.  Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey background.  The calibration of this fan chart takes account of the likely path dependency of the economy, where, for example, it is judged that shocks to unemployment in one quarter will continue to have some effect on unemployment in successive quarters.  The fan begins in 2013 Q4, a quarter earlier than the fan for CPI inflation.  That is because Q4 is a staff projection for the unemployment rate, based in part on data for October and November. The unemployment rate was 7.1% in the three months to November, and is projected to remain at 7.1% in Q4 as a whole.

Chart 5.5 Projected probabilities of GDP growth in 2016 Q1 (central 90% of the distribution)(a)  Section 5 Prospects for inflation 49 outturns have led the Committee to increase the uncertainty around the unemployment projection in the near term.  The risks to the projection are judged to be broadly balanced.   CPI inflation has fallen back to the 2% target.  Under the assumption that Bank Rate follows a path implied by market interest rates, inflation remains close to, or a little below, the target throughout the forecast period (Chart 5.2).  The projection is lower than in November in the near term (Chart 5.7), reflecting unexpectedly low outturns, smaller rises in utility prices than the MPC had assumed, and the appreciation of sterling.  Further out, a lower contribution from import and administered and regulated prices is broadly offset by a smaller drag from slack (Table 5.D).  As in November, the risks around the outlook are assumed to be balanced, and the probability of inflation being above 2.5% 18–24 months ahead is around 30% (Chart 5.8).    The projections described above are conditioned on Bank Rate following the path implied by market interest rates, such that Bank Rate rises in the first half of 2015, and reaches 2% by early 2017.  The MPC also considers projections based on constant interest rates.  The constant rate projections in this Report assume that Bank Rate is 0.5% for the next three years and then rises towards the market path over the following three years, and that this path is anticipated by businesses and households.  Relative to the market rate projections, lower rate expectations boost asset prices and lower the exchange rate, both of which support demand.  In addition, for the period that interest rates are below the market path, net interest payments by households are lower and their disposable income higher.  Under those assumptions, GDP is judged likely to grow at above-average rates throughout the forecast period (Chart 5.9).  Productivity growth is also assumed to be a little stronger, and in the central case, the unemployment rate falls nearly ¾ percentage point more than under the market curve assumption (Chart 5.10).  Inflation is higher and remains somewhat above the target (Chart 5.11):  the probability of inflation being above the target is just under 60% at the forecast horizon, compared with just under 50% in the market rate projection.    5.3 The policy decision The UK recovery has gained momentum.  Unemployment has fallen more sharply than expected;  nonetheless spare capacity remains.  CPI inflation has fallen back to the 2% target more quickly than anticipated and, with domestic costs well contained, is expected to remain at, or a little below, the target for the next few years. At its February meeting, the Committee noted that the existence of spare capacity is both wasteful and increases the risk that inflation will undershoot the inflation target in the medium term.

The MPC therefore judged that there remained scope to absorb spare capacity further before raising Bank Rate. It seemed likely that data released over the next few months would show that the 7% threshold has been reached.  The Committee agreed on further guidance for when the unemployment threshold was reached.  That guidance is explained in the box ‘Monetary policy as the economy recovers’ on pages 8–9.  Essentially, the MPC will seek to close the spare capacity in the economy over the next two to three years while keeping inflation close to the target.  To that end, it judges that there is scope for the economy to recover further before Bank Rate is raised and, even when Bank Rate does rise, it is expected to do so only gradually and to a level materially below its pre-crisis average of 5%. In the light of both the economic outlook and its policy guidance, the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5% and the stock of purchased assets at £375 billion. 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 2009 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Percentage increase in prices on a year earlier   + – Chart 5.11 CPI inflation projection based on constant nominal interest rates at 0.5% and £375 billion purchased assets See footnote to Chart 5.2. 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 2009 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Unemployment rate, per cent     0 See footnote to Chart 5.6.

Chart 5.9 GDP projection based on constant nominal interest rates at 0.5% and £375 billion purchased assets  Section 5 Prospects for inflation 51 Other forecasters’ expectations Every three months, the Bank asks a sample of external forecasters for their latest economic projections.  This box reports the results of the most recent survey, carried out during January.  On average, respondents expected annual CPI inflation to be close to, albeit a touch above, its current rate of 2% over the next three years (Table 1).  Average inflation expectations for the year ahead have fallen slightly since the November Report.  Four-quarter GDP growth was, on average, projected to rise a little further, but was expected to be below its historical average rate of 2.75% over the next three years (Table 1).  Year-ahead growth expectations were stronger than they had been three months earlier.  The LFS unemployment rate was expected to fall to 6% over the next three years (Table 1).  This was 0.7 percentage points lower than the average expectation for unemployment three years ahead recorded in the November Report. These forecasts assumed a slightly tighter monetary stance to those made three months ago.  The stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves was, on average, expected to be £24 billion lower by the three-year horizon.  And the sterling ERI was expected to be around 3% higher, on average, over the next three years. The Bank also asks forecasters for their assessment of the risks around their central projections for CPI inflation, GDP growth and the unemployment rate (Table 2).  The average probability assigned to inflation being above the target at the two-year horizon fell back slightly relative to the previous survey, but inflation was still judged a little more likely to be above the target than below it:  in contrast, the MPC judged the risks around the target to be broadly balanced at that point.  The average probability distribution around forecasters’ central GDP projections has shifted up with their central expectations.  As a result, the average probability attached to GDP growth being more than 3% has increased noticeably over the past six months, at all horizons (Chart A).

2016-11-03,"Inflation Report November 2016   BANK OF ENGLAND Inflation Report November 2016 In order to maintain price stability, the Government has set the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) a target for the annual inflation rate of the Consumer Prices Index of 2%. Subject to that, the MPC is also required to support the Government’s economic policy, including its objectives for growth and employment. The Inflation Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff under the guidance of the members of the Monetary Policy Committee.  It serves two purposes.  First, its preparation provides a comprehensive and forward-looking framework for discussion among MPC members as an aid to our decision-making.  Second, its publication allows us to share our thinking and explain the reasons for our decisions to those whom they affect. Although not every member will agree with every assumption on which our projections are based, the fan charts represent the MPC’s best collective judgement about the most likely paths for inflation, output and unemployment, as well as the uncertainties surrounding those central projections. This Report has been prepared and published by the Bank of England in accordance with  section 18 of the Bank of England Act 1998.

At its meeting ending on 2 November 2016 the Committee voted unanimously to maintain  Bank Rate at 0.25%.  The Committee voted unanimously to continue with the programme of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases totalling up to £10 billion, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves.  The Committee also voted unanimously to continue with the programme of £60 billion of UK government bond purchases to take the total stock of these purchases to £435 billion, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves. At the time of the August Inflation Report, the Committee announced a package of supportive measures that it judged was appropriate to balance the trade-off that had emerged in the economic outlook.  On the one hand, economic activity was expected to weaken and unemployment to rise, given the period of uncertainty likely to follow the referendum on EU membership.  On the other hand, inflation was expected to rise to a rate above the 2% target, for an extended period, as a result of the depreciation of sterling that had accompanied the referendum result.  At the August meeting, a majority of Committee members also expected to support a further cut in Bank Rate at one of the remaining MPC meetings of 2016 if the outlook remained broadly consistent with the one set out in the August Report. In the three months since then, indicators of activity and business sentiment have recovered from their lows immediately following the referendum and the preliminary estimate of GDP growth in Q3 was above expectations.  These data suggest that the near-term outlook for activity is stronger than expected three months ago.  Household spending appears to have grown at a somewhat faster pace than projected in August, and the housing market has been more resilient than expected.  By contrast, investment intentions have continued to soften and the commercial property market has been subdued. In financial markets, the past three months have been characterised by two phases.  In the first, the sterling exchange rate stabilised for a period following its initial post-referendum depreciation.  Supported by the measures announced by the MPC in August and more positive activity indicators, financial conditions and other asset prices recovered from the deterioration seen straight after the referendum, accompanied by a sharp increase in corporate bond issuance.  However, in the period since the beginning of October, the sterling effective exchange rate index has depreciated further.   Market intelligence attributes these latter movements to perceptions that the United Kingdom’s future trading arrangements with the EU might be less open than previously anticipated, requiring a lower real exchange rate to improve competitiveness and support activity.  Longer-term gilt yields have risen notably, as have market-implied expectations of medium-term inflation.   The Committee’s latest projections for output, unemployment and inflation, conditioned on average market yields, are set out in the November Inflation Report.  Output growth is expected to be stronger in the near term but weaker than previously anticipated in the latter part of the forecast period.  In part that reflects the impact of lower real income growth on household spending.  It also reflects uncertainty over future trading arrangements, and the risk that UK-based firms’ access to EU markets could be materially reduced, which could restrain business activity and supply growth over a protracted period.  The unemployment rate is projected to rise to around 5½% by the middle of 2018 and to stay at around that level throughout 2019.  ii                                                                                                                                                             Inflation Report  November 2016 Largely as a result of the depreciation of sterling, CPI inflation is expected to be higher throughout the three-year forecast period than in the Committee’s August projections.  In the central projection, inflation rises from its current level of 1% to around 2¾% in 2018, before falling back gradually over 2019 to reach 2½% in three years’ time.  Inflation is judged likely to return to close to the target over the following year. The MPC’s Remit requires that monetary policy should balance the speed with which inflation is returned to the target with the support for real activity.  Developments since August, in particular the direct impact of the further depreciation of sterling on CPI inflation, have adversely affected that trade-off.  This impact will ultimately prove temporary, and attempting to offset it fully with tighter monetary policy would be excessively costly in terms of foregone output and employment growth.  However, there are limits to the extent to which above-target inflation can be tolerated.   Those limits depend, for example, on the cause of the inflation overshoot, the extent of second-round effects on inflation expectations and domestic costs, and the scale of the shortfall in economic activity below potential.  In the MPC’s November forecast, the inflation overshoot is the product of a perceived shock to future supply, which has caused the exchange rate to fall, alongside a modest projected shortfall of activity.  Inflation expectations have picked up to around their past average levels and domestic costs have remained contained.  Given the projected rise in unemployment, together with the risks around activity and inflation, and the potential for further volatility in asset prices, the MPC judges it appropriate to accommodate a period of above-target inflation.  That notwithstanding, the MPC is monitoring closely the evolution of inflation expectations. In light of these developments, and in keeping with its Remit, the MPC at its November meeting agreed unanimously that Bank Rate should be maintained at its current level.  It also agreed unanimously that it remained appropriate to continue the previously announced asset purchase programmes, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves. Earlier in the year, the MPC noted that the path of monetary policy following the referendum on EU membership would depend on the evolution of the prospects for demand, supply, the exchange rate, and therefore inflation.  This remains the case.  Monetary policy can respond, in either direction, to changes to the economic outlook as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target.    In the United Kingdom, the MPC’s August policy package helped to lower interest rates and support asset prices.  Since the start of October, however, UK gilt yields have risen sharply and by more than yields in other advanced economies, alongside a further depreciation in sterling.  Global activity growth slowed during the first half of the year, but this weakness is expected to be temporary and growth will be supported by policy measures and financial conditions.  Oil prices have risen, which will push up headline inflation rates. 1   Financial markets and global economic developments                                                                                                                                                                Section 1 Financial markets and global economic developments                               1 Developments in UK asset prices and financial conditions since August can be divided into two broad phases, as set out in the box on pages 2–3.  Initially, the main influence was the announcement of the MPC’s policy package on 4 August (Section 1.1), which lowered interest rates (Chart 1.1) and boosted UK asset prices (Section 1.2).  Since the beginning of October, however, UK-focused asset prices have underperformed international equivalents and some borrowing costs have risen, alongside a significant further depreciation in sterling (Chart 1.2).  Market contacts suggest those moves were associated with increased perceptions that the United Kingdom’s future trading arrangements with the European Union might be less open than previously thought likely. Although global activity growth slowed somewhat in Q2,  the near-term outlook is for global growth to strengthen a little, to a similar rate as projected three months ago (Section 1.3).  The large falls in oil prices during 2014–15  had been weighing on headline inflation rates, but those effects have started to wane (Section 1.4).  The rise in oil prices since the August Report will further support headline inflation rates. 1.1   Monetary policy developments As explained in the box on pages 2–3, at its August meeting the MPC voted to implement a package of policy measures designed to support the domestic economy.  The various elements of this package are expected to operate through a number of channels, including by boosting sterling asset prices and lowering the cost of finance for UK companies (Section 1.2).  The MPC voted to make no changes to this package at its September meeting, as set out in the box on page 5.  The details of the November decision are contained in the Monetary Policy Summary on pages i–ii of this Report, and in more detail in the Minutes of the meeting. Per cent Jan. Apr.

Initially, the main influence was the announcement of the MPC’s policy package on 4 August.  This supported UK asset prices and lowered borrowing costs.  Since the beginning of October, however, UK-focused asset prices have underperformed their equivalents internationally and some borrowing costs have risen, alongside a significant further depreciation in sterling. This box discusses the effect of these influences on UK asset markets and financial conditions in more detail. Developments in August and September On 4 August, and as discussed in the box on pages iii–viii of the August Report, the MPC announced a package of measures to support the UK economy, consisting of: • A 25 basis point cut in Bank Rate to 0.25%. • A Term Funding Scheme (TFS) to reinforce the pass-through of the cut in Bank Rate, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves. • Purchases of a stock of up to £10 billion of sterling  non-financial investment-grade corporate bonds, issued by firms making a material contribution to the UK economy, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves. • An increase in the stock of purchased UK government bonds, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by £60 billion, to £435 billion. The MPC also noted that, if the incoming data proved broadly consistent with the August Inflation Report projections, a majority of members expected to support a further cut in Bank Rate to its effective lower bound during the course of 2016.   The various elements of this package were expected to boost sterling asset prices and lower the cost of finance for UK companies.  The initial response of financial markets was consistent with this expectation and, if anything, the impact was slightly greater than had been anticipated.  The cut in Bank Rate to 0.25% had already been priced into the short end of the yield curve (Chart 1.3), but the market-implied path fell over the whole three years of the MPC’s forecast period, perhaps as market participants took a signal from the guidance that Bank Rate was likely to be cut further before the end of the year.  Domestic government bond yields also fell and the spreads on corporate bonds narrowed (Table 1).  This lowered the cost of issuing debt for companies with access to those markets.  In addition, equity prices rose by 1½%.   Funding costs for UK banks also decreased in August (Section 1.2).  One factor that may have contributed to the narrowing in spreads is the TFS.  By providing funding at close to Bank Rate, with a penalty rate if banks reduce net lending, the TFS may have reduced banks’ relative demand for other sources of funding, which all else equal should reduce spreads on that funding.  In addition, the announcement of the Corporate Bond Purchase Scheme (CBPS) may have helped to reduce bank funding spreads.  Although bank bonds are not eligible for the scheme, by reducing yields on the bonds of non-financial companies the CBPS may have indirectly increased the demand for, and reduced the yields on, bank bonds. Throughout the rest of August, yields remained lower and many asset prices higher than before the August Report, supporting domestic financial conditions.  Indeed, there are signs that these developments have already begun to affect interest rates on bank lending to households and companies. In the weeks preceding the MPC’s announcement,  market-implied interest rate expectations had fallen and those households taking out a fixed-rate mortgage received lower quotes as a result.  For example, two-year fixed rates for new mortgages at 75% or 90% loan to value fell by around 20 basis points between May and July (Table 2).  Since then, the rates on fixed-rate products have fallen further and many households with floating-rate mortgages have seen a cut to their mortgage rates as well.  Companies have also started to benefit from lower interest rates:  banks responding to the 2016 Q3 Credit Conditions Survey reported that lower wholesale funding costs were being passed through to companies, with rates on corporate lending consequently falling.

Section 1 Financial markets and global economic developments                               3 Developments in October During October some of the improvement in financial conditions that had taken place during August unwound. Around the beginning of the month, UK yields began to rise (Chart 1.1).  Some of that occurred alongside rises in interest rates internationally (Chart 1.4) suggesting that global factors were a driver.  The increases in UK benchmark yields were, however, somewhat larger and coincided with a further marked depreciation in sterling (Table 1).  In the run-up to the November Report sterling was 6½% lower than at the time of the August Report.  Market contacts largely attribute those moves to changes in perceptions of the United Kingdom’s future trading arrangements (Section 1.2). Alongside the depreciation in sterling and the rise in benchmark yields, inflation compensation increased (Section 1.2).  For example, compensation for UK RPI inflation five to ten years ahead derived from inflation swaps has risen by a little over 50 basis points since August (Table 1).   The cost for some companies of issuing debt in capital markets also rose slightly over this period:  spreads on corporate bonds issued by less-risky companies — investment-grade bonds — widened a little, and sterling corporate bonds more broadly have underperformed relative to their US dollar and  euro-denominated equivalents (Section 1.2).  While the overall FTSE All-Share index rose somewhat, it will have been boosted by the effect of the fall in sterling on the value of companies’ foreign income;  domestically focused companies’ equity prices fell (Table 1).   The overall impact of these more recent developments on financial conditions will depend on the net effect of the moves in the exchange rate and asset prices.  The rises in yields, to the extent that they persist, represent a tightening in financial conditions and are likely to feed through to the interest rates faced by households and companies.  Set against that, however, the depreciation in sterling will, all else equal, support UK financial conditions by making sterling assets more attractive to foreign investors.

Some market participants had expected an extension of the ECB’s asset purchase scheme beyond March 2017 to be announced at the September meeting and, following the announcement, bond yields rose slightly.  But reports from market contacts suggest that most still expect an announcement of further easing in monetary policy in December. On 21 September, the Bank of Japan announced a number of changes to its policy framework after a review of its ‘quantitative and qualitative easing’ and negative interest rate policies.  These included a target for the yield on ten-year government bonds, a removal of the maturity target for purchased assets and a commitment to overshoot its 2% inflation target.  The changes aimed to help to prevent further reductions in bank profitability, support lending and increase inflation expectations.  While the reaction of Japanese government bond prices to these announcements was subdued, the equity prices of Japanese banks rose on the announcement.

In the United States, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted to keep rates on hold in September, and US, UK and euro-area yield curves flattened following the announcement (Chart 1.4).  Subsequently, however, the implied path for the federal funds rate steepened, and in the run-up to the November Report was around 15 basis points higher than in August (Chart 1.3). 1.2   Developments in financial markets Exchange rates At the time of the August Report, sterling had depreciated by 15% relative to its November 2015 peak.  In the fifteen working days to 26 October it had depreciated by a further 6½% (Chart 1.2).  The bulk of the decline in sterling occurred from the beginning of October, which market contacts largely attributed to changes in perceptions of the United Kingdom’s future trading arrangements.  In the weeks leading up to the November Report, sterling implied volatility from options prices had also picked up, perhaps reflecting increases in investors’ uncertainty around the future value of sterling, although it remained below its level at the time of the referendum. Interest rates The market-implied path for Bank Rate fell slightly after the MPC’s August announcement (see the box on pages 2–3). Although the 25 basis point cut in Bank Rate had been largely expected by market participants, they may have taken a signal from the guidance that, should the incoming data be consistent with the August Report forecast, a majority of MPC members expected to support a further cut in Bank Rate to its effective lower bound during the course of 2016. Longer-term gilt yields also fell (Chart 1.1).  Given the size of the gilt purchases announced, that fall was broadly in line with previous announcements of asset purchases, particularly the first round of purchases during 2009.(1) Following those initial falls, UK yields subsequently rose from the beginning of October and, in the run-up to the November Report, both the market-implied path for Bank Rate (Chart 1.3) and longer-term gilt yields (Chart 1.1) were higher than at the time of the August Report.  Some of that rise occurred alongside rises in long-term interest rates internationally (Chart 1.4), suggesting that global factors were a driver.  UK yields, however, have risen by more than those in the United States and euro area, possibly for similar reasons that drove the fall in the sterling ERI.   Per cent Jan. Apr.

Section 1 Financial markets and global economic developments                               5 Monetary policy since the August Report The MPC’s central projection in the August Report was that four-quarter GDP growth would slow materially in the near term, before settling below its historical average rate by the end of the forecast period.  This reflected a drag on private domestic demand growth from uncertainty in the near term, and a path for potential supply growth that was well below past averages.  CPI inflation was projected to pick up over the next year, rising above the 2% target from 2018, as the depreciation in sterling and the unwinding of the effects of the past falls in energy and imported goods prices offset an increased margin of spare capacity.  That central projection was conditioned on:  the path for Bank Rate implied by  market interest rates;  the announced Term Funding Scheme; and the stock of purchased gilts and corporate bonds  reaching £435 billion and £10 billion respectively and remaining there throughout the forecast period.  The last three elements would be financed by the issuance of central bank reserves.  At its meeting ending on 14 September, the MPC continued  to expect a material slowing in UK GDP growth in the second half of 2016, although survey indicators suggested somewhat less of a slowing than anticipated in the August Report.  The announcement of the MPC’s policy package in August had  led to an increase in UK asset prices and falls in market interest rates.  In addition, many banks had announced cuts in both variable and fixed-rate mortgage products and deposit rates.  Twelve-month CPI inflation had remained at 0.6% in August, lower than projected at the time of the August Report, and well below the 2% inflation target.  Despite the lower starting point, CPI inflation was still expected to rise to around the 2% target in the first half of 2017, as the influence of past falls in energy and food prices waned.  All Committee members judged it appropriate to leave the stance of monetary policy unchanged.  Although news on the near-term momentum of the UK economy had been slightly to the upside, the MPC’s view of the contours of the economic outlook following the EU referendum had not changed.  If the outlook in November was judged to be broadly consistent with the August Report projections, a majority of members expected to support a further cut in Bank Rate to its effective lower bound at one of the MPC’s forthcoming meetings during the course of 2016. Changes in nominal government bond yields can reflect changes in both real interest rates and inflation compensation. Compensation for inflation five to ten years ahead in the United States and euro area has fallen markedly over the past two years and, although they have risen slightly since August, they remain well below their historical average levels (Chart 1.5).  The UK measure — which is related to RPI inflation — has recovered its fall over the past year and is around past average levels.  In part, this may reflect increases in inflation expectations or increased perceptions of risks around future inflation.  In addition, these measures may also be influenced by other factors.  For example, fluctuations in demand from certain investors — such as pension funds and insurers — for hedging the risks associated with liabilities that are linked to future inflation rates can have a material impact on these measures.  Market contacts suggest that demand from those investors has been particularly strong in recent months, having been more subdued around the time of the referendum.   Notwithstanding the recent increases in yields, longer-term interest rates across advanced economies remain lower than at the start of the year (Chart 1.4), continuing their long-term decline.  As discussed in the box on pages 8–9, while monetary policy may have played some role in the recent decline, the longer-term decline in interest rates across many countries is likely to reflect mainly global structural factors such as increases in desired saving and greater risk aversion. 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 Jan.

The spread between the yield on sterling bonds issued by lower-risk companies — known as investment-grade bonds — and equivalent government  bond yields narrowed significantly after the MPC’s announcement of the Corporate Bond Purchase Scheme (CBPS) (Chart 1.6).  In contrast, the spreads on US dollar and euro-denominated bonds were little changed.  Although sterling investment-grade spreads widened slightly alongside the depreciation in sterling in October, they remain narrower than at the time of the August Report.  All else equal, these narrower spreads will have reduced the cost of issuing  sterling-denominated bonds and supported issuance, which has picked up sharply since the MPC’s announcement (Section 2). Spreads on sterling-denominated debt issued by riskier borrowers — known as high-yield bonds — narrowed to a similar degree to those issued by less risky borrowers  following the announcement of the CBPS (Chart 1.6).  They subsequently narrowed further, in line with spreads on  dollar and euro-denominated bonds, perhaps reflecting a gradual reduction in investors’ perceptions of risk internationally.  During October, however, sterling high-yield corporate bonds underperformed relative to their US dollar and euro-denominated equivalents. UK equity prices have increased since August.  The FTSE  All-Share index rose by around 1½% on the announcement  of the MPC’s policy package and, in the run-up to the November Report, was around 5% higher than at the time of the August Report (Chart 1.7).  The FTSE All-Share index has outperformed the equity prices of UK-focused companies since June.  That probably reflects the boost to the profits of internationally focused companies from the recent depreciation of sterling.  Over the past year, changes in the equity prices of these internationally focused companies relative to those of domestically focused companies have been closely correlated with changes in the sterling exchange rate (Chart 1.8).  Improved global sentiment may have also boosted the prospects of those internationally focused companies:  equity prices in the euro area, Japan and emerging market economies (EMEs) were also slightly higher at the time of the November Report than three months ago (Chart 1.7). Bank funding costs Banks can raise funds either through issuing debt or equity. Although UK bank equity prices remain lower than before the EU referendum, the cost of wholesale debt funding has fallen due, in part, to a narrowing in funding spreads (Chart 1.9).  As explained in the box on pages 2–3, the TFS and CBPS may have contributed to that narrowing in spreads.

This was due in part to slower growth in the United States and EMEs;  indicators of activity growth in Q3, however, suggest that this weakness was temporary. Growth is therefore projected to pick up gradually to a similar rate to that projected three months ago.  As in recent Reports, the risks around the projection for global growth are judged to lie to the downside, largely on account of continued vulnerabilities in EMEs (Section 5). Euro area  Having recovered from its weakness in 2013, four-quarter euro-area GDP growth has been steady over the past two years, supported by monetary policy and a slightly expansionary fiscal stance.  Quarterly growth in Q3 remained at 0.3%, as projected in the August Report. The near-term outlook for euro-area activity is for growth to pick up slightly around the turn of the year, a little faster than projected three months ago.  Measures of uncertainty in the euro area, which had risen around the time of the EU referendum, have since fallen back (Table 1.B).  Indicators of business activity and confidence have strengthened slightly, although some remain subdued relative to their pre-crisis levels.  In contrast, consumer confidence has eased back a little since June, although it remains around its past average level. United States  Over the past few years the US economy has continued to expand at a modest rate, driven by household consumption growth (Chart 1.10).  Quarterly activity growth recovered to 0.7% in Q3, from a temporary dip in Q2 as the drag from stockbuilding unwound.  Business investment growth remains weak, however, in part reflecting the effect of lower oil prices on energy-related investment.  In the near term, activity is projected to continue growing at a little above ½% per quarter, supported by a gradual increase in productivity growth, albeit to rates below its pre-crisis average. Employment growth, despite some volatility, appears to have been resilient.  Monthly non-farm payrolls increased by 192,000 on average in Q3, slightly above the level consistent with a stable unemployment rate.  An increase in participation, however, led to a small increase in the unemployment rate to 5.0%.

Some of the recent declines, particularly in short-term interest rates, are likely to reflect cyclical factors with many economies having experienced similar shocks and policy responses during and after the financial crisis.  Longer-term interest rates have, however, been declining globally for several decades (Chart A), suggesting that global structural factors — such as demographics and increased risk aversion — are likely to have been the primary driver.  To the extent that monetary policy makers have set policy rates at low levels, this is likely to be a consequence of these trends, rather than being the primary cause of low rates:  had central banks failed to track this trend, policy would have been too tight and inflation and output too low.(1) While the transition from a higher inflation environment to lower, more stable, inflation in many advanced economies will have contributed to some of the decline in nominal interest rates since the 1980s, measures of real interest rates, which account for this, have also declined significantly over that period.  Given the highly integrated nature of global capital markets, a key factor behind this decline is likely to have been shifts in global saving and investment preferences.  This box examines the evidence for such shifts in more detail. What influences long-term real interest rates? Longer-term real interest rates will be determined by the balance between saving and investment preferences.  For example, an increase in desired saving for a given desire to invest will lower the real interest rate required to bring actual saving and investment into line.   The decline in global real interest rates since the 1980s has been accompanied by broadly stable actual investment (and saving) relative to GDP.  If the fall in real interest rates had been driven only by an increase in desired saving, the amount of actual saving and investment would have been expected to increase (moving from point A to point B in Chart B).  The relative stability of the actual investment share therefore suggests that desired investment has also fallen (moving from B to C in Chart B).  Together changes in desired saving and investment may be able to explain some of the falls in real interest rates since the 1980s.  But estimates of the effects of these are extremely uncertain:  desired saving and investment are unobservable, as are their relationships with real interest rates. Global growth expectations In classical theories of growth, household saving decisions, wealth and the real interest rate are closely, and positively, related to the rate of technological progress, or productivity. Global growth expectations were broadly stable until the financial crisis, however, so this factor is unlikely to explain much of the decline in real interest rates observed before then. Downward revisions to global growth expectations since the financial crisis, however, could account for some of the more recent fall in long-term interest rates.  For example, Consensus forecasts for global growth in five to ten years’ time have fallen by around 1 percentage point since 2007. Other shifts in desired global saving In addition to changes in expected future economic growth, other factors may have increased desired global saving, which would be reflected in the blue line in Chart B moving outwards and lowering the real interest rate (from point A  to B).  One such factor is the changing global demographic (1) For more detail on this, see Broadbent, B (2014), ‘Monetary policy, asset prices and distribution’;  www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2014/ speech770.pdf;  and Carney, M (2013), ‘The spirit of the season’; www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2013/speech696.pdf.

Section 1 Financial markets and global economic developments                               9 profile.(1) Net wealth typically increases over an individual’s working lifetime:  young people tend to have more debt than older people, and over their working lives individuals tend to accumulate wealth in order to finance their consumption in retirement.  Over the past few decades, the age distribution has changed such that a greater proportion of the population are at stages of life associated with higher rates of saving. Further, as life expectancy has tended to increase relative to average retirement ages, individuals may choose to save a greater proportion of their income while they are working in order to finance the same rate of consumption in their retirement.  These demographic effects are likely to have increased aggregate desired wealth and pushed down real interest rates.(2)(3) Changes in the distribution of income and wealth within countries may also have pushed up desired saving.(4) People’s saving rates tend to increase with their incomes, so the rise in income inequality since the 1980s — which has been associated with a greater proportion of income going to those in the higher income groups — may have pushed up aggregate desired saving.(5) Another driver of desired saving is likely to have been a rise in EME government saving.  During the Asian debt crisis in the late 1990s, the sudden reversal of capital flows to emerging economies prompted a sharp slowing in activity.  Since then, EME governments have increased their saving, in part as a precautionary measure to avoid fluctuations in private sector borrowing destabilising their economies, which will have pushed down real interest rates.  In recent years, however, the saving of oil-exporting economies have fallen significantly, which may have pushed up real interest rates. Other shifts in desired global investment At the same time as the rise in desired saving, desired investment appears to have fallen, consistent with the magenta line in Chart B moving inwards (from point B to point C).  That is likely to have reflected several factors.  For example, investors in risky projects require an expected rate of return greater than the real interest rate on relatively safe assets, such as government bonds, in order to compensate them for the risk they may lose some of their initial investment.  While the cost of financing for companies has fallen in recent decades across many countries, it has fallen by less than yields on government bonds.  That suggests that the compensation that investors require for holding risky assets has increased, perhaps reflecting increased risk aversion or heightened perceptions of risk:  for example, if investors perceive that the probability of significant adverse events have increased they may be more willing to pay more for, and tolerate lower returns on, relatively safe government debt.(6) This could have offset some of the boost to desired investment that would otherwise have been provided by lower real interest rates. Another factor that will influence desired investment is the price of capital goods, which has fallen significantly relative to output prices since the 1980s.  That means that it costs businesses less, as a share of their revenue, to fund a given investment project.  The lower price of capital may have encouraged some companies to undertake more investment, which would increase the overall capital stock.  As the stock of capital increases, the extra productive potential of increasing it further is likely to decline.  If this effect is sufficiently large, then the real interest rate would be expected to fall.(7) Other trends are also likely to have affected desired investment.  For example, public sector investment rates have been declining over the past few decades.  To the extent that those projects are not otherwise funded by the private sector, this would weigh on aggregate desired investment.  And there have been some signs of a shift in corporate behaviour towards a greater distribution of earnings to investors instead of using these funds for investment, which may be due to the changing nature of incentives such as those associated with a reduction in the time shares tend to be held for.(8) Conclusion  The impact of shifts in desired saving and investment on global real interest rates could explain much of the fall in real long-term interest rates in recent decades.  But the relative sizes of the effects of these factors are highly uncertain, as is the outlook for real interest rates, which will depend on the extent to which these structural shifts persist.

While broader measures of underemployment — which include those who would like to work more hours for example, or those marginally attached to the labour force — remain elevated relative to their pre-crisis levels, most measures suggest that slack has narrowed over the past couple of years. Perhaps reflecting this, measures of wage growth have shown tentative signs of picking up:  for example, the Employment Cost Index measure of wages increased by 2.4% over the four quarters to 2016 Q3, up from around 2% in 2014–15. Emerging market economies Over the past few years, four-quarter activity growth in China has slowed gradually from around 10%.  This slowing appears to have stabilised in recent quarters, and growth in Q3 was broadly in line with expectations at 6.7% (Table 1.A).  At the end of last year there had been concerns among market participants of a more pronounced slowing in growth.  Those concerns appear to have diminished, at least in the near term; capital outflow pressures have eased and the depreciation in the renminbi exchange rate has been gradual.  But activity continues to be underpinned by strong domestic credit growth, which poses a risk to the medium-term sustainability of growth. Elsewhere, EME activity growth slowed a little further.  Growth was weaker than expected in 2016 H1 as activity in Brazil contracted by more than anticipated and growth in India slowed slightly.  Bank lending conditions also continued to tighten (Chart 1.11).  Some of the weakness in growth reflected erratic factors and so is likely to dissipate.  In addition, the adverse effects of lower commodity prices (Section 1.4) on commodity exporters is expected to diminish following recent increases in oil prices.  Moreover, portfolio capital inflows to EMEs increased in Q3 and corporate bond spreads have also narrowed in recent months.  This may suggest some improvement in financial conditions, which should support near-term growth prospects.  Consistent with this, more recent data and forward-looking indicators suggest some improvement in overall EME growth in Q3.  In particular, there are signs of stabilisation in Russia and Brazil, two economies that accounted for a significant proportion of the slowdown in overall EME growth during 2012–16. As in August, the balance of risks to EME growth prospects remains to the downside.  Many EMEs have a large stock of outstanding debt, and may be vulnerable to capital outflows and any tightening in financial conditions, for example if US interest rates rise more quickly than expected. 1.4   Commodity markets and developments in inflation Inflation across advanced economies remains weaker than prior to the financial crisis (Table 1.C).

Section 1 Financial markets and global economic developments                             11 rates have been dragged down by falls in the prices of  energy-related goods following the fall in oil prices in 2014–15 (Chart 1.12).  In addition, the prices of other commodities, including agricultural products, have drifted lower over the past two years. As the effects of past falls in oil prices have begun to fade, headline inflation rates have started to increase and will be boosted further by the rise in oil prices since the start of the year.  Ultimately the price of oil is determined by the balance between oil supply and demand.  Over the past few years, oil supply growth has been robust and outstripped demand growth, largely on account of non-OPEC supply (Chart 1.13). Although non-OPEC supply fell during the four quarters to 2016 Q3 — in part in response to lower oil prices — the International Energy Agency projects supply to recover in 2017.  Uncertainty surrounding a potential OPEC agreement to limit production was behind some volatility in oil prices in August and September.  An agreement was announced on 28 September that, if implemented, would reduce oil production from recent levels.  In the run-up to the November Report, oil prices were 12% above their level at the time of the August Report (Chart 1.12). Measures of core inflation — which exclude the direct effects of changes in energy and food prices — remain fairly subdued. This is likely to reflect some remaining slack in advanced economies.  As global growth picks up (Section 5), this should reduce slack and put upward pressure on domestic costs and core inflation.  The near-term projection is for an increase  in headline inflation globally, little changed from three  months ago. 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 2008 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Contribution to supply growth:  non-OPEC Contribution to supply growth:  OPEC Total supply growth (per cent) Total demand growth (per cent) Percentage points   + – Chart 1.13 Oil supply growth has slowed to below demand growth Four-quarter growth in global oil supply and demand Sources:  International Energy Agency Oil Market Report© OECD/IEA 2016 and  Bank calculations. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Jan.

Measures of uncertainty in the economy had picked up ahead of the June referendum and rose further in July.  That appeared to be weighing on indicators of activity and property markets.  For example, the July Markit/CIPS business survey — which has in the past been a better gauge of official output data than most other survey measures — pointed to a weaker outlook than in the MPC’s August projections, consistent with a sharp fall in activity.  Uncertainty was expected to remain elevated in the near term, reflecting the range of possible outcomes for the United Kingdom’s future trading arrangements and their differing implications for economic activity and incomes. Since then, the slowing in growth has been much less severe than those indicators initially suggested.  According to the latest ONS estimates, GDP growth slowed only slightly to 0.5% in 2016 Q3 from 0.7% in Q2 (Chart 2.1).  It is expected to remain at 0.5% in the mature estimate, compared to the August projection of 0.1%.  The slowing in Q3 mainly reflected falls in manufacturing and construction output (Chart 2.2). Growth in business-facing service sectors also slowed somewhat.  In part, this is likely to have reflected a weakening in commercial real estate transactions (Section 2.1).  In contrast, output growth in consumer-facing service sectors strengthened, suggesting household demand growth remained robust.  While survey measures of expected activity continued to decline slightly in Q3 as a whole, some monthly indicators such as the Markit/CIPS measure recovered in August and September from their July lows (Chart 2.3).  Overall, GDP growth is projected to slow slightly further to 0.4% in 2016 Q4, consistent with a preliminary estimate of 0.4%. Within the modest slowing in GDP growth in 2016 H2, Output grew by 0.5% in Q3.  This was slightly lower than Q2 growth and a much less marked slowing than expected at the time of the August Report.  The near-term outlook for growth is also stronger.  While investment intentions have weakened further since August, household spending appears to have remained robust and conditions in the housing market have been resilient.  The past depreciation in sterling should support net trade and will boost the sterling value of foreign income, helping to narrow the current account deficit. 1.0 0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 Projection(c) Percentage changes on a quarter earlier Projection for preliminary GDP   at the time of the August Report(c)   GDP  Estimate implied by the mode   of the latest backcast(b) + – 2012 13 14 15 16 Chart 2.1 GDP growth is projected to slow slightly further in Q4 Output growth and Bank staff’s near-term projection(a) Sources:  ONS and Bank calculations.

A broad-based indicator of the level of uncertainty has fallen from its July peak, although it remains above its long-run average and firms responding to the CBI survey reported that their uncertainty about the outlook for demand increased markedly in Q3 (Chart 2.4).  Net trade is also projected to support GDP growth in coming quarters (Section 2.2), although it is likely to be sensitive to changes in perceptions of the United Kingdom’s future trading arrangements (see the box on pages 21–22).  2.1   Domestic demand Business spending  Business investment rose modestly in Q2 (Table 2.B) but was lower than a year ago.  These early data are, however, volatile and prone to revision.(1) At the time of the August Report, survey indicators and intelligence from the Bank’s Agents suggested that the heightened level of uncertainty around the outlook was weighing on firms’ investment intentions, and business investment was projected to fall in the near term. Since then, survey indicators have, on average, weakened further (Chart 2.5).  The stronger outlook for output growth suggests, though, that investment is likely to fall by less than projected in August (Table 2.A). A number of factors are likely to be affecting the outlook for investment.  First, heightened uncertainty following the referendum is likely to weigh on companies’ investment decisions.(2) Second, investment could be affected by any decisions by firms to reallocate capital in anticipation of changes in UK trading arrangements.  Third, the 21% depreciation in sterling since November 2015 (Section 1) will raise the cost of imported capital goods.  As a significant proportion of investment is relatively capital-intensive, this may deter some investment spending. Prices and activity in the commercial real estate (CRE) market can also affect companies’ spending in a number of ways. Around a quarter of investment directly reflects spending on new and existing buildings, including costs associated with CRE transactions, such as legal fees.  While CRE market activity will directly affect that transaction expenditure, sentiment in the market may also affect investment more broadly.  In addition, many firms use property as collateral for borrowing.  Fluctuations in CRE prices can, therefore, affect their access to finance.

There are two main types of pension funds:  defined-benefit and defined-contribution.  Payouts by defined-contribution funds depend on the return earned on investments, while for defined-benefit funds, the value of those payments is specified in advance.  When calculating the current value of defined-benefit pension funds’ assets and liabilities, those future payments are typically discounted in line with a benchmark yield curve.  As a result, the value of their liabilities can increase when long-term interest rates fall.  The overall effect of changes in long-term interest rates on the net value of a pension fund and hence the degree to which it is in deficit will depend, however, on how the value of its assets change.  For example, falls in interest rates associated with an easing in monetary policy will typically boost the value of both assets and liabilities.  All else equal, therefore, funds starting from a balanced position will typically remain so, although those funds starting from a deficit position would probably see some widening in their deficits.(1) When deficits have increased in the past, they have typically closed over time as pension funds’ assets have historically earned a higher average return than the interest rates used to calculate the value of their liabilities.  This has not, however, been the case over the past five years, as falls in long-term interest rates have outpaced increases in the prices of riskier assets, such as equities, and pension deficits have widened (Chart A).(2) As explained in the box on pages 8–9, most of those falls in the yield curve are likely to have reflected the influence of global factors such as increased risk aversion.   There are around 6,000 defined-benefit pension schemes in the United Kingdom, of which around 80% are currently in deficit.  One timely measure of the size of the aggregate deficit is provided by the Pension Protection Fund.  On that measure, UK defined-benefit pension funds had a deficit of 29% of their assets at the end of September (Chart A). Although that deficit has widened over much of the past year, it narrowed slightly in September and is likely to have narrowed further in October, in line with the rise in long-term interest rates (Section 1). The widening in defined-benefit pension funds’ deficits over recent years could have macroeconomic consequences if it influences businesses’ decisions such as their spending, hiring and dividend payouts.  This box examines the evidence, so far, on their macroeconomic effects, drawing on the results of a recent survey by the Bank’s Agents.  Economic implications An increase in pension deficits could affect businesses’ decisions through two key channels.  One channel is if firms reduce spending in order to increase their pension contributions.  Firms are required by The Pensions Regulator to have plans in place to close their deficits.  When making those plans, however, companies are allowed to consider their forecast for cash flows after essential investment and their plans for sustainable growth.  As such, defined-benefit pension contributions have been broadly stable over the past decade despite fluctuations in the size of deficits.  The second key channel is if an increase in pension deficits raises firms’ financing costs.  The widening in deficits since 2014 does not, however, appear to have dragged on the equity prices of those companies compared with the broader index (Chart B).  Factors other than pension deficits, however, such as the depreciation in sterling, are likely to have supported these companies’ equity prices more recently, perhaps because they are on average more internationally focused (Section 1). Perhaps consistent with that, there is little evidence so far to suggest that changes in pension deficits have weighed on firms’ spending decisions in aggregate.  While past analysis by Bank staff and other researchers has found that companies’ (1) See Bean, C (2012), ‘Pension funds and quantitative easing’; www.bankofengland.co.uk/archive/Documents/historicpubs/news/2012/050.pdf for a discussion of the effects of monetary policy on pension fund assets and liabilities.

Calculated on a S179 basis, which is the theoretical cost that would have to be paid to a private insurance company to take on the level of protection provided by the Pension Protection Fund.  As the Fund does not provide protection for the full liability, this number may be somewhat smaller than a measure (the technical provisions measure) calculated for each scheme by trustees and considered by The Pensions Regulator every three years.  Data are up to September 2016.

In addition, a recent survey on investment intentions conducted by the Bank’s Agents suggests that, in aggregate, pension deficits were not having a significant impact on firms’ investment plans for the coming year (Chart C).  Companies with pension deficits report that this is due to a number of factors, including:  the periods over which they intend to close their deficits, which have in some cases been extended or were expected to be extended in future;  their balance sheets, which have strengthened during recent years;  and their access to finance, which has improved.  As with investment, there is little evidence, so far, that the increase in pension deficits has weighed on employment or wage growth.  The Bank’s Agents and respondents to business surveys have not reported this factor as being a significant influence on hiring or pay decisions. Conclusion The evidence examined so far suggests that changes in defined-benefit pension fund deficits do not appear to have been a significant influence, in aggregate, on firms’ spending decisions over the past or on their current plans for future spending. The effects of low long-term interest rates on defined-benefit pension fund deficits was one of the main issues discussed when the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) and the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on 4 October.  Both Committees will continue to monitor developments in pension fund deficits and evidence on the implications for the economic outlook and financial stability closely. The Committees were also briefed on how the outlook for economic activity and inflation had evolved since the August Report, as detailed in the MPC’s September Minutes and the box on page 5.  And they were briefed on how the outlook for UK financial stability had evolved.  As detailed in the FPC’s September Record, the financial system had demonstrated resilience to spikes in uncertainty and risk aversion.  Core financial markets had functioned effectively despite initial sharp price moves and particularly high volumes of transactions relative to normal levels in some markets. Bank funding conditions had remained broadly stable.  That reflected the consistent building of resilience in the financial system over recent years, extensive contingency planning undertaken by the Bank of England and financial institutions in the run-up to the referendum, and the co-ordinated actions taken by the Bank after the referendum.(2) In addition to defined-benefit pension fund deficits, there were a number of other issues identified that were particularly pertinent to both Committees and which they agreed they would continue to monitor closely in this forum.  That included bank resilience, profitability and future credit conditions, and the distribution of household indebtedness.

Despite rising in September, the value of CRE transactions in Q3 was 40% lower than a year ago.  The RICS commercial property market survey reported a small rise in occupier demand for CRE, although demand remains weak, especially in London.  Consistent with the weakness in demand for CRE, prices fell in Q3 and market contacts and indicators, such as the RICS survey, suggest that new construction also declined.  Market contacts expect CRE prices to fall further over the coming year.  Businesses’ investment decisions can also be affected by the cost of finance.  The cost of market-based finance for non-financial companies has changed little since August despite the rise in benchmark interest rates, as spreads on corporate bonds have narrowed slightly (Section 1).  In addition, banks’ business lending rates, which are generally linked to Bank Rate or Libor, fell in the months following the MPC’s August announcement (Table 2 in the box on pages 2–3).  Despite those declines in the cost of finance, net external finance raised by private non-financial corporations was lower in 2016 Q3 than in Q2 (Table 2.C).  Within that, net issuance of commercial paper and net new bank lending fell, consistent with evidence from the Q3 Credit Conditions Survey that firms’ demand for loans declined in Q3.  In contrast, corporate bond issuance picked up and market contacts expect the Bank’s Corporate Bond Purchase Scheme (Section 1) to support sterling issuance in coming months.  Respondents to the Credit Conditions Survey expected the cost and availability of corporate credit to remain stable and demand to remain subdued in Q4. While low interest rates should support investment, they can also increase the value of companies’ liabilities, particularly those of their pension funds.  Firms with large pension deficits could choose to reduce their investment spending in order to increase their pension contributions.  As explained in the box on pages 14–15, however, the evidence so far suggests that the size of pension deficits has not been a major influence on firms’ investment spending in the past.  Moreover, a recent survey on investment intentions conducted by the Bank’s Agents suggests that, in aggregate, pension deficits were not having any significant influence on firms’ investment plans.  Household spending and the housing market In the August Report, consumption growth was projected to ease gradually in 2016 H2.  Indicators of household spending growth, such as new car registrations and retail sales, and stronger-than-expected output growth suggest that consumption growth remained robust in Q3, however.  There is little evidence of uncertainty depressing spending so far.   In the near term, consumption growth is projected to slow modestly as real income growth slows (Table 2.A).

Section 2 Demand and output                                                                                         17 nominal income growth has been subdued (Section 4), real income growth over the past year (Table 2.D) has been boosted by falls in food and energy prices (Section 4).  That increase in purchasing power appears to have supported robust household consumption growth in 2016 H1.  As food and energy prices have stopped falling, real income growth is expected to have slowed in 2016 H2.  Further ahead, the pickup in import prices, following the depreciation in sterling, is likely to weigh further on real income growth.  Households’ confidence in their expected income and financial situation will influence their decisions to spend or save out of their current income.  The GfK/EC measure of households’ confidence in making major purchases — which has typically been a good indicator of spending growth — has been above its long-run average for the past two years (Chart 2.6).  The cost and availability of credit is another key influence on households’ spending and saving decisions.  The cut in Bank Rate has lowered interest rates on deposits and borrowing (see the box on pages 2–3).  Lower interest rates will reduce debt-servicing costs for borrowers.  Although it will also reduce the income on deposits for savers, the net effect will support aggregate consumption.  Moreover, the latest Bank/NMG survey of household finances shows that households with greater savings, who may be experiencing a fall in their income from deposits, are also likely to hold more non-deposit financial assets, which will have risen in value in response to lower interest rates. The fall in interest rates will also support household spending by lowering the cost of consuming now relative to the future. Household unsecured credit growth was robust over the year to September and respondents to the Credit Conditions Survey expect demand for credit to rise in Q4.  Another indicator of households’ spending intentions is their money holdings, such as deposits.  Growth in household money has been picking up since the start of the year — annual growth in the M4 measure was 6.9% in September compared to 3.8% at the end of 2015.  Over a similar period, households appear to have withdrawn money from equity and property-related funds.  As such, the pickup in household money holdings may, in part, reflect a desire to hold more liquid assets in the face of uncertainty about the general economic situation as opposed to a greater desire to spend. Reflecting robust household confidence and the low level of interest rates, the saving rate is projected to decline a little further in coming quarters.  There are risks, however, around that outlook, associated with the impact of general economic uncertainty on household confidence and the timing of any such effect.  If households were to become less confident in their prospects for income growth — for example, in response to any increases in unemployment — then that could be associated with a rise in precautionary saving.

Developments in the housing market and consumption are closely linked.  Indeed, house price inflation and consumption growth have been highly correlated in the past.  In large part, that close relationship is because household decisions to consume or buy property are driven by common factors such as income growth, confidence and financial conditions.  Beyond those common factors, however, there are a number of channels through which developments in the housing market and household spending can be interlinked. This box considers the evidence for three main potential channels, drawing on household-level data including the latest Bank/NMG survey of household finances, before considering estimates from a structural econometric model of the aggregate relationship between house prices and consumption. The collateral effect When house prices rise, the value of homeowners’ equity also increases.  This can allow households to use that increase in equity as collateral to borrow against.  Such a collateral channel would be expected to result in increases in house prices being associated with increases in homeowners’ consumption relative to that of renters. Household-level data from the ONS Living Costs and Food Survey provide some evidence of a collateral channel over much of the past 25 years.  On average, homeowners’ consumption was more sensitive to changes in house prices than that of renters.(1) Bank staff estimate that a 10% increase in house prices was associated with a boost to the level of consumption averaging 0.5% over the following year, which was reversed in the subsequent year.  The size of that effect is small, however, compared with the average comovement between house prices and consumption over the past.  Data on households’ housing equity withdrawals can provide a cross-check on this estimate, as withdrawals used to fund consumption are likely to be one of the main ways the collateral channel influences consumption.  Over 1995 to 2014, an estimate of equity withdrawn through mortgage advances for consumer spending aligns quite closely with the estimate of the propensity to spend out of the increase in house prices over that period (Chart A).   In the most recent Bank/NMG survey conducted in September 2016, there is tentative evidence that the effect of this channel may be even smaller at the moment.  A similar proportion of homeowners and renters reported that they would expect to increase their spending in response to a 10% increase in house prices. The distributional wealth effect A rise in house prices may also affect spending by changing perceptions of wealth.  For an individual household this will depend on their expected future demand for housing as well as their current demand.  For households planning on trading down in the future, a rise in house prices may mean they expect to release more cash when they make that move, which could cause them to spend more now.  Those purchasing for the first time or trading up, however, may need to put in more cash or take out a larger mortgage when they make that move, which could lead them to save more now.  If the former has a bigger effect on aggregate spending than the latter, then increases in house prices would boost spending through this distributional wealth channel.  The effects of such a channel would be expected to be seen in a difference in the response of older households’ consumption to changes in house prices, relative to that of younger households.  Household-level data, however, provide little evidence of such a difference.  Indeed, younger households’ consumption appears to have risen more in response to increases in house prices than that of older households in the past.(2) Consistent with that, the latest Bank/NMG survey (1) This ﬁnding is broadly consistent with those of other researchers.  See for example Disney, R, Gathergood, J and Henley, A (2010), ‘House price shocks, negative equity and household consumption in the United Kingdom’, Journal of the European Economic Association, Vol. 8(6), pages 1,179–207.

The durable goods effect Moving house is often associated with a greater propensity to purchase certain durable goods, such as furniture and household appliances.  Changes in the volume of housing transactions can, therefore, influence the consumption of these goods.  This would support consumption to the extent that these purchases are not financed by reducing other consumption.  The British Household Panel Survey provides evidence of such a durable goods channel.  Households are found to be two to three times more likely to purchase white goods when moving house.(1) The effect of this channel on consumption is, however, quite small as household appliances only form 0.6% of the consumption basket.  Those data suggest that an additional 100,000 housing transactions — close to a doubling of transactions from the current monthly rate — would be associated with around a 0.05% increase in annual consumption.  The overall impact of the housing market on consumption Taken together, the evidence suggests that these direct links from house prices to consumption are too small to explain the strong correlation seen between consumption and house prices in the data.  That is consistent with an important role for common factors in driving both.  As well as easily observed variables such as current income, those common factors may be things that are hard to measure like households’ uncertainty or their future income expectations.  House prices may therefore provide timely information on how these are changing, and the outlook for household spending, even if they are not actually driving changes in that outlook themselves.  Macroeconometric models of the economy typically find a significant link between house prices and consumption growth.  One such model, which is used to inform the MPC’s projections for consumer spending, suggests that a one-off 10% rise in house prices would, on average, be associated with stronger mortgage lending and a boost to the level of consumption averaging just under 1% over the following year, fading back to around ½% in the year after.(2) This impact assumes no additional feedback to household incomes and other variables.  The fact that this is a much stronger and more persistent effect than suggested by the microeconometric evidence suggests that the impact of house prices on consumption in macroeconometric models may indeed reflect the effect of common factors that are influencing both, as well as any direct effect of house prices on spending.

As explained in the box on pages 18–19, household spending is closely related to developments in the housing market. Housing market activity will also have a more direct effect on housing investment.  Around a quarter of housing investment reflects spending on services associated with housing transactions.  As discussed in the May Report, the pre-announced rise in stamp duty land tax in April 2016 led some transactions that would otherwise have taken place later in the year to be brought forward (Chart 2.7).  That resulted in a sharp rise in transactions in Q1 and a subsequent fall in April. Since then, housing transactions have risen modestly, though they remain below their late-2015 levels. Mortgage approvals, a leading indicator of housing transactions, have fallen in recent months (Chart 2.7) and annualised growth in the average of the Halifax and Nationwide house price indices slowed to 2.5% in the three months to September from 4.6% in the three months to June. Both of those were somewhat higher than forward-looking indicators at the time of the August Report suggested and, while housing transactions and house price inflation are projected to remain subdued, the outlook is more resilient than in August.

The fall in mortgage interest rates (see the box on pages 2–3) should also be supporting demand for house purchases.  Lenders responding to the Q3 Credit Conditions Survey reported that demand for mortgages fell significantly in 2016 Q3, but is expected to recover in Q4. Around three quarters of housing investment consists of investment in new dwellings and improvements to existing dwellings.  At the time of the August Report, heightened uncertainty was projected to weigh on new housing starts. The Bank’s Agents and market contacts report that this impact appears to have been less severe, so far, than projected. Investment in new dwellings rose in 2016 Q2 and forward-looking indicators, such as housing starts and new construction orders also rose.  Housing investment is projected to remain broadly unchanged in the near term (Table 2.A). Government spending The MPC’s November projections are conditioned on the Government’s spending plans, along with tax and benefit rates, set out in the March Budget.  The MPC’s February 2017 projections will include any changes to those plans and policies that are announced in the Autumn Statement on 23 November. 2.2  Net trade and the current account Net trade dragged on growth in the first half of 2016, mainly reflecting weak growth in exports (Table 2.B).  The vote to leave the European Union is likely to lead to an adjustment in the composition and size of UK trade flows, reflecting changes in trading arrangements with other countries.  There is considerable uncertainty around what those eventual arrangements will be and how quickly trade flows will respond in anticipation of those changes.   Sterling has depreciated by 21% since its peak in November 2015.  This will affect the prices of UK imports and exports, which should support net trade through two key channels — reducing domestic demand for imported goods and services and supporting foreign demand for UK exports. As explained in the box on pages 21–22, however, the outlook for net trade and the extent of that support will be influenced by a wide range of factors. Net trade is expected to have supported GDP growth in Q3 and to continue to support growth in the near term.  The Bank’s Agents report that the depreciation in sterling has supported demand for exports, consistent with rises in survey indicators of growth in goods export orders (Chart 2.8). 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 2000 03 06 09 12 15 CBI BCC(b) Markit/CIPS Agents Differences from averages since 2000 (number of standard deviations) + – Chart 2.8 Growth in export orders appeared to pick up in Q3 Survey measures of goods exports(a) Sources:  Bank of England, BCC, CBI, IHS Markit and Bank calculations.

It will reflect, among other factors, developments in foreign demand (Section 1), domestic demand (Section 2.1) and the sterling exchange rate.  The depreciation in sterling of 21% over the past year (Section 1) should support UK exports and weigh on imports over coming years.  But, as set out in this box, there is uncertainty over the magnitude of these effects, and net trade — exports less imports — will be sensitive to how companies anticipate and respond to possible future changes in the United Kingdom’s trading arrangements. Trade prices Movements in sterling are likely to affect export and import prices, but the scale and timing of that impact will depend on how exporters and importers respond.  The initial ability of firms to adjust prices will depend on factors such as the length of contracts and the currency in which exports and imports are invoiced. When companies reset prices they face a choice of how much to adjust them by.  For instance, in response to the depreciation, UK exporters could maintain their export prices in sterling terms, passing through all of the depreciation to lower export prices in foreign currency terms.  UK export prices relative to those of the rest of the world, in common currency terms, would therefore fall.  This gain in competitiveness would support UK export volumes. Alternatively, exporters could choose to maintain foreign currency export prices and earn a higher sterling profit margin on exports sold.  That decision for exporters of how much to adjust prices is likely to depend on:  how persistent they expect the fall in sterling to be;  the strength of demand growth in their export markets;  how price-sensitive they judge demand for their products to be;  and how many inputs to production they import. At the same time, the pass-through of the fall in sterling to import prices will depend on a similar set of factors, including foreign exporters’ pricing strategies in light of conditions in the UK economy (Section 4).(1) Higher import prices relative to the prices of available domestic alternatives will make imported goods and services less competitive, which will weigh on import volumes. The overall scale of the boost to net trade from a depreciation will depend on the extent of these movements in trade prices. Both export and import prices have typically changed by about 60% of any change in sterling:  for instance, they picked up by around 15% following the depreciation of sterling of around 25% in 2007–08 (Chart A).  Foreign currency export prices, therefore, tend to be cut by around 40% of any fall in sterling:  UK exporters become somewhat more competitive but also allow margins to rise.  That increase in export margins is likely to be gradually competed away, as exporters raise production or new firms enter export markets, boosting export supply.  But it can take time for capital and labour to shift between sectors to enable this. The net trade outlook The response of trade volumes to changes in trade prices associated with the fall in sterling and the net trade outlook in coming years will depend on how domestic and foreign firms anticipate and respond to the evolution of UK trading arrangements following the vote to leave the European Union.(2) Uncertainty over the United Kingdom’s long-term trading arrangements could mean that those companies that currently, or would aspire to, export have less incentive to invest to expand capacity.  For example, UK companies may delay entering new markets or foreign firms may put off planned investment in UK-based capacity.  In addition, uncertainty may make EU importers, and perhaps importers in other countries, reluctant to renew or enter into new contracts with UK exporters.

The United Kingdom is highly integrated into supply chains: the latest estimates for 2011 suggest that around a quarter of UK exports were part of supply chains with other EU countries.(1) Developments in net trade in coming years are likely to differ across the economy.  For instance, some goods producers are particularly integrated into EU supply chains.  Some service sectors such as financial services benefit from relatively open access to EU markets.  The surplus in financial services trade is around 3% of GDP, around 1¼ percentage points of which is with the European Union, and it accounts for the majority of the surplus in services trade (Chart B).  Prospects in these areas of the economy are, therefore, likely to be sensitive to any changes in trading arrangements. In addition, there is evidence that increased specialisation in goods over time may have limited the scope to substitute easily away from imports to domestically produced goods in which the United Kingdom may not have a comparative advantage.(2) Indeed, cross-country evidence suggests that the increasing role of global supply chains over time may have steadily reduced the sensitivity of trade volumes to changes in the exchange rate and trade prices.(3) The outlook for net trade over the MPC’s forecast horizon is discussed in Section 5. (1) This estimate is based on data in the OECD’s World Input-Output database.

Global value chains and the exchange rate elasticity of exports’, World Bank Policy Research Working Paper No. 7390. Payment flows associated with trade and investment between the United Kingdom and the rest of the world will be reflected in the current account.  The current account deficit widened slightly to 5.9% of GDP in Q2 from 5.7% in Q1 (Chart 2.9). This was driven by a widening in the trade deficit, which was partly offset by a fall in the primary income deficit.  Primary income is the value of net investment income received by UK residents.  As UK residents hold more foreign currency assets than they have foreign currency liabilities, the depreciation will have boosted the sterling value of net primary income.  The depreciation will have also boosted the sterling value of foreign currency assets relative to foreign currency liabilities, contributing to an improvement in the United Kingdom’s international investment position. The current account is projected to narrow further over the coming quarters as the effects of the depreciation continue to be passed through to income flows.

Employment growth has also eased  in recent months.  Broadly consistent with the continued softening in survey indicators of employment intentions (Chart 3.1), employment growth is projected to slow  further in the near term (Section 3.1).  That slowing is more gradual than projected in August (Table 3.B), reflecting stronger-than-expected output growth.    The unemployment rate and overall slack in the economy are projected to be broadly stable in the near term (Section 3.2). Developments in output growth further ahead will depend on labour supply growth (Section 3.3) and on productivity growth (Section 3.4).  Subdued demand and elevated uncertainty are likely to weigh on productivity growth, by reducing investment in physical capital and in skills and innovation.  The path for productivity will also be sensitive to whether firms anticipate any changes to trading arrangements between the  United Kingdom and its economic partners, and any adaption of production ahead of the transition to those arrangements (Section 5). 3.1   Labour demand Employment growth slowed slightly in the three months to August (Table 3.A), but was stronger than expected at the time of the August Report.  That slowing is likely in part to reflect a normalisation in the labour market, following the absorption of spare capacity and rapid growth in employment over 2012–15.  Consistent with that, indicators suggest that, in recent quarters, recruitment difficulties have been similar to or greater than prior to the financial crisis. In the near term, employment growth is projected to slow further, to below its past average rate, as companies respond to the more subdued demand outlook and above-average levels of uncertainty (Section 2).

The softening in employment growth in 2016 H2 appears likely, however, to be more gradual than expected at the time of the August Report.  Unemployment is projected to be stable in the near term.  The outlook for output growth will depend in part on developments in supply, which will be sensitive to changes in trading arrangements between the United Kingdom and its economic partners.  In the near term, productivity growth is projected to remain subdued.  24                                                                                                                                                          Inflation Report  November 2016 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.4   Per cent of unemployment Unemployment to   employment ﬂow(b)   (right-hand scale)   Vacancies(a)   (left-hand scale)    Per cent of the labour force 2002 04 06 08 10 12 14 16 0.0 0 Chart 3.2 Vacancies have been broadly flat recently  Vacancies and flow from unemployment to employment survey indicators of employment intentions, which fell further in Q3 (Chart 3.1).  That slowing is more gradual than projected in August, consistent with the stronger path for output growth in 2016 H2 (Section 2). The projected further slowing in employment growth mainly reflects an expected easing in the rate of hiring, rather than an increase in the rate of job losses.  There is uncertainty, however, around the extent, timing and composition of that slowing, and there are risks in both directions.  To assess whether the projection for employment growth is on track, the MPC monitors a wide range of aggregate and sectoral indicators of the labour market, including official data, survey evidence and reports from the Bank’s Agents. One key indicator of hiring is the number of vacancies.  The number of vacancies rose strongly over 2012–14, leading to a sharp pickup in the rate at which unemployed people found jobs (Chart 3.2).  Since the beginning of 2015, the number of vacancies has been fairly flat, and is expected to fall slightly in the near term, broadly consistent with survey indicators of recruitment intentions.  The Bank’s Agents report that the softening in recruitment intentions since the referendum has been concentrated in some professional and financial services subsectors.  In addition, in consumer services, the increase in some wage costs as a result of the National Living Wage — which came into effect in April (Section 4) — is reported to have weighed on recruitment intentions. In contrast, the rates at which employees are made redundant or move from employment to unemployment for other reasons have been well below past average levels in recent quarters (Chart 3.3), and are likely to remain low in the near term.  That is consistent with the stability in indicators of job losses, such as the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) survey of businesses’ redundancy intentions and the GfK/EC survey of households’ expectations for unemployment. 3.2  Slack in the economy Economic slack tries to capture the extent of underused resources, which may exert downward pressure on inflation. One important aspect of slack is unemployment.  Reflecting the past strength in labour demand growth, the unemployment rate fell steadily over 2013–15, and was stable at 4.9% in the three months to August (Chart 3.4).  Consistent with the  near-term projection for employment growth (Section 3.1), unemployment is projected to remain stable over the rest of the year, slightly lower than projected in August. Beyond the near term, unemployment is projected to rise modestly (Section 5).

Table 3.B Monitoring the MPC’s key judgements Developments anticipated in August Developments now anticipated Unemployment  Revised down slightly • Unemployment rate to rise to just over 5% by 2017 Q1. • Unemployment rate to rise to just over 5% by 2017 Q2. Participation Revised up slightly • Labour market participation rate to remain stable at around 63½%. • Participation rate to fall back slightly,  and then remain just below 63¾% during 2017 H1. Average hours Broadly unchanged • Average hours to fall by ¾% in the year to 2017 Q1. • Average hours to fall by just under ½% in the year to 2017 Q2. Productivity Revised up slightly • Quarterly hourly labour productivity growth of around ¼% in the near term. • Quarterly hourly labour productivity growth of between ¼% and ½% in the near term.                                                                                                                                                                  Section 3 Supply and the labour market                                                                       25 with neither upward nor downward pressure on wage growth. There is, however, uncertainty around this judgement. On the one hand, unemployment could still be above its equilibrium.  Wage growth has remained weak in the face of the decline in the unemployment rate, which could suggest a lower equilibrium rate of unemployment.  The rising average age of the workforce and increased degree of educational attainment over the past two decades are characteristics that have tended to be associated with lower unemployment rates and so could have lowered the equilibrium rate.  In addition, some changes in government policy over recent decades, such as to welfare payments, may have lowered the equilibrium rate by increasing the incentive and ability to move from unemployment into employment.  Perhaps consistent with that, the short-term unemployment rate has been below its pre-crisis average for some time (Chart 3.5), and it does not appear to have put material upward pressure on wage growth (Section 4). On the other hand, the equilibrium rate of unemployment could be higher.  In particular, the long-term unemployment rate remains above its pre-crisis average (Chart 3.5), despite strong labour demand in recent years.  That could indicate that the pool of unemployed people may currently be less well-suited to the available jobs than prior to the crisis.  In addition, increases in the National Living Wage (Section 4) may be associated with a slight weakening in labour demand and a small rise in equilibrium unemployment in the medium term. Another important aspect of slack in the economy is the margin of spare capacity within firms.  Survey measures of capacity utilisation have declined (Chart 3.6), as output growth has slowed, suggesting that capacity pressures have eased. Based on the indicators discussed above and top-down statistical estimates, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that there is likely to be currently a small degree of slack in the economy, and this is projected to persist in the near term. 3.3  Labour supply Beyond the near term, output growth will, in part, be determined by labour supply.  The main driver of growth in labour supply is population growth.  In the MPC’s projections, population growth is assumed to evolve in line with the ONS’s latest projection, made in October 2015.  Under those projections, population growth slows over the next three years in part due to a fall in net migration. The prospects for net migration at present are particularly uncertain, and will depend on a number of factors, such as the United Kingdom’s relative economic performance as well as 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 2002 04 06 08 10 12 14 16 Employment to    unemployment ﬂow(b) + – Redundancies(a) Differences from averages since 2000 (number of standard deviations) Companies’ expected    redundancies   (CIPD survey)(c) Households’   unemployment    expectations   (GfK/EC survey)(d) Sources:  CIPD, GfK (research carried out on behalf of the European Commission),  Labour Force Survey (LFS) and Bank calculations.

The CIPD survey suggests that a net balance of companies expect to find it more difficult to recruit new migrant workers over the next year (Table 3.C).  While net migration contributes to labour supply, it also contributes to domestic demand, and so changes in migration are likely to have relatively small implications for inflationary pressure.(1) Labour supply also depends on the share of the population actively participating in the labour market.  The participation rate is likely to have risen further in Q3 (Chart 3.7), but is expected to fall back slightly in Q4, and to remain broadly stable in coming quarters.  That reflects the continuation of two large but broadly offsetting factors:  a fall in the share of the population in younger age groups most likely to participate in the labour market, set against increased participation among older people. Labour supply will also be influenced by the number of hours those in work want to work.  Average usual hours worked have been broadly stable over the past two years even though average actual hours worked have been volatile (Chart 3.8) due to fluctuations in the extent of leave taken.  As discussed in previous Reports, average usual hours worked are expected to ease gradually in coming years as the average age of the workforce continues to rise, while average actual hours are projected to fall back to a greater extent as the amount of leave normalises from its currently subdued level.(2) The outlook for both participation and average hours is uncertain.  On the one hand, there is a risk that, in the face of a slowing in labour demand growth, some workers become discouraged from participating in the labour market or seek to reduce their hours.  On the other hand, a slowing in real wage growth as imported cost pressures pick up (Section 2) could support desired hours and participation as households attempt to offset the impact on their income. 3.4  Productivity  Four-quarter hourly productivity growth is expected to have been broadly stable, but subdued, at 0.5% in Q3 (Chart 3.9). That is slightly faster than anticipated in August, reflecting stronger-than-expected output growth (Section 2).  Growth in productivity can be decomposed into changes in capital per hour worked — the equipment and resources that are available to produce output — and growth in total factor productivity (TFP), the efficiency with which firms combine capital and labour inputs to produce output.  Since 2012, growth in capital per hour has been particularly weak but TFP growth has also been below its past average rate. 62.6 62.8 63.0 63.2 63.4 63.6 63.8 64.0 2001 04 07 10 13 16 Per cent 0.0 (a)  Percentage of 16+ population.

For instance, evidence suggests that the rate of reallocation of resources, such as the flow of workers between jobs, has been subdued, while weak wage growth may have encouraged companies to switch from capital inputs towards labour.(1) More generally, productivity growth has been sluggish in many advanced economies for several years, reflecting the effects of the financial crisis and, perhaps, an increased divergence between the most productive firms and the rest.(2) How these factors evolve will be important for productivity growth in coming years. Productivity growth will also be sensitive to the eventual trading arrangements between the United Kingdom and its economic partners and the transition to those new arrangements.  The box on page 29 of the August Report set out some of the long-term effects of openness to trade on productivity growth.  It remains difficult to know the nature, scale and speed of companies’ adjustment in the near term to any anticipation of changes in future trading arrangements and to the uncertainty around those arrangements. In the near term, weak investment stemming from uncertainty about demand and the United Kingdom’s trading arrangements (Section 2) is likely to reduce growth in the capital stock and thus productivity growth.  Heightened uncertainty may also weigh on investment in research, skills and innovation — so-called ‘intangible’ capital — and so on TFP growth.  Perhaps consistent with that, according to the CIPD survey, a net balance of companies report having revised down their plans to invest in training and skills  (Table 3.C).  Furthermore, there may need to be some reallocation of resources if the composition of demand for UK output changes as trading arrangements change.  That could weigh on TFP growth for some time, as firms adjust resources and production to meet the new pattern of demand, or if they are less able to specialise in certain sectors.  Overall, productivity growth is projected to remain subdued in the near term (Table 3.B), although the outlook remains highly uncertain and there are risks in both directions (Section 5). 31.0 31.5 32.0 32.5 33.0 33.5 35.0 35.5 36.0 36.5 37.0 37.5 2004 06 08 10 12 14 16 Hours   Hours   Average weekly   actual hours(b)   (left-hand scale)   Average weekly   usual hours(a)   (right-hand scale)    0.0 0.0 Sources:  Labour Force Survey and Bank calculations.

That partly reflects the effects of past falls in energy prices dropping out of the annual comparison.  Further ahead, higher import prices associated with the past depreciation in sterling and the further significant fall since August are expected to push up inflation for several years.  Only partially offsetting these effects, subdued domestic demand growth is likely to weigh on wage growth and domestically generated inflation.  Inflation expectations are judged to be broadly consistent with the MPC’s 2% target.  4.1   Consumer price developments and the near-term outlook CPI inflation picked up to 1.0% in September, from 0.5% in June (Chart 4.1), but remains below the 2% target.  The deviation of inflation from the target has largely reflected drags from energy and food prices (Chart 4.2).  While that has mainly been a result of falls in global commodity prices, the appreciation in sterling between 2013 and 2015 has also lowered energy and food prices, as well as imported goods and services inflation more broadly.  In addition, muted labour cost growth has weighed slightly on domestic inflationary pressures.  Measures of core inflation — which exclude components such as energy and food — have therefore also been subdued, reflecting both the past appreciation and weaker labour cost growth. The rise in headline inflation to September largely reflected the drag from past falls in commodity prices continuing to drop out of the annual rate (Chart 4.2).  As such it was broadly in line with the projections in recent Reports (Chart 4.1).  Clothing and footwear price inflation was, however, somewhat stronger than expected three months ago. As in the August projection, CPI inflation is projected to continue to rise over the next three months (Chart 4.1) and over 2017.  The contribution to inflation from petrol prices is expected to turn increasingly positive, in part reflecting rises in oil prices since January (Section 4.2).  In addition, sterling has depreciated by 21% since its peak in November 2015, which will continue to push up the prices of energy and other imported goods and services.  The precise path for inflation will depend on the speed and degree to which companies pass through rising external costs (Section 4.2) to consumer prices, given domestic conditions (Section 4.3).

The influence of domestic pressure on inflation will also depend on companies’ and households’ inflation expectations, insofar as they influence wage and price-setting behaviour (Section 4.4). 4.2  Imported cost pressures Consumer goods and services are produced using a range of inputs.  While companies can adjust the composition of their inputs over the medium term, there is a limited ability to do so over short time frames.  Sharp fluctuations in the cost of inputs are therefore likely to affect overall costs.  Much of the volatility in the cost of producing consumer goods and services over recent years has reflected energy and non-energy import costs (Chart 4.3).  This includes a period of falling energy prices and other import costs over the past three years, but these components have begun to push up overall cost growth more recently.  Energy prices  In the run-up to the November Report, sterling oil prices had risen by 20% since the August Report.  They were around 70% higher than at the end of 2015, unwinding a third of the fall since 2013 (Chart 4.4).  That reflected higher US dollar oil prices (Section 1), together with the depreciation in sterling.  The cost of oil currently makes up around a quarter of the cost of retail fuel, and changes in oil prices tend to be passed through to retail prices quickly.  The contribution of petrol prices to inflation is therefore expected to rise over the coming months, as past falls drop out of the annual comparison and more recent oil price rises are passed through to retail fuel prices.  Indeed, petrol prices were a little higher  in September than a year ago, pushing up CPI inflation  (Chart 4.2). The wholesale gas spot price has been volatile in recent months, but futures prices are little changed relative to August (Chart 4.4).  As a result, retail gas prices are projected to remain flat over the near term, in line with the August projections. Non-energy import prices The sharp fall in sterling is also likely to put significant upward pressure on non-energy import prices in the coming year. Foreign currency export prices have continued to fall  (Chart 4.5), in part reflecting falls in US dollar agricultural prices (Section 1).  Sterling has, however, depreciated by 21% since its November 2015 peak, with 6½% having occurred since the August Report.  Reflecting the effects of that depreciation, four-quarter sterling non-energy import price inflation is expected to have risen to 6½% in 2016 Q3, from Table 4.A Monitoring the MPC’s key judgements  Developments anticipated in August Developments now anticipated Household energy prices Broadly unchanged • Domestic gas and electricity prices to be unchanged in 2016.  • Domestic gas and electricity prices to be unchanged in the first half of 2017.

As discussed in previous Reports, Bank staff estimate that, on average, 60% of changes in sterling foreign export prices tend to be reflected in UK import prices, with that pass-through usually completed within a year.(1) Within that, the speed and extent of pass-through will vary by product or service.  In particular, the prices of highly tradable goods, such as food, are likely to see greater pass-through.  The latest official data on import prices appear broadly consistent with the decline in sterling passing through in line with that estimate.  The extent of pass-through to consumer prices will, however, depend on the factors underlying the change in the exchange rate, as well as prevailing economic conditions.   4.3  Domestic cost pressures and companies’ margins In addition to imported cost pressures, the outlook for inflation will depend on domestic developments.  While domestically generated inflation (DGI) is not directly observable, a range of indicators suggest that it has picked up in recent quarters, although it remains subdued (Chart 4.6). Those indicators include labour costs — the largest component of domestic costs — and companies’ profit margins.  Overall, the profile for consumer price inflation will depend significantly on when and to what degree companies pass on changes in costs — both imported and domestic — or absorb them in their margins.  Companies’ margins Margins on consumer goods and services were squeezed during the financial crisis by higher external costs (Chart 4.3), reflecting higher global commodity prices and the depreciation in sterling.  Since then, they have recovered and Bank staff estimate that margins were close to their pre-crisis levels in early 2016 (Chart 4.7).   Margins appear to have narrowed in 2016 Q2 and are likely to be squeezed further in the near term, as higher import costs are only gradually passed through to consumer prices.  As discussed in previous Reports, Bank staff estimate that, on average, changes in import prices are eventually passed through to the CPI in full — implying margins are restored over time.(2) As the import content of the CPI is around 30%, together with the estimate that around 60% of changes in  the exchange rate are passed through to import prices (Section 4.2), that would imply the depreciation in sterling 10 5 0 5 10 15 20 25 2007 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 Percentage changes on a year earlier   Foreign export   prices in foreign currency(d)    Foreign export prices   in sterling terms(b)     UK import price deﬂator(c)      + – 16 Chart 4.5 The fall in sterling has pushed up import price inflation UK import and foreign export prices excluding fuel(a) Sources:  Bank of England, CEIC, Eurostat, ONS, Thomson Reuters Datastream and Bank calculations.

On average over the past, pass-through is estimated to have occurred relatively gradually, with annual inflation still being affected four years after the change in sterling.  The speed of pass-through associated with a fall in sterling, however, will depend on a number of factors, including the reasons for  the depreciation.  There is evidence to suggest that the  pass-through of exchange rate moves that stem from supply developments tends to be faster,(1) as does the  pass-through from large moves in the exchange rate.(2) Following the recent further fall, sterling has depreciated by 21% since its November 2015 peak, some of which has occurred alongside stronger-than-expected activity growth (Section 2), and appears to be associated with an increase in perceptions that the United Kingdom’s future trading arrangements with the European Union might be less open than previously thought likely (Section 1), and so a weaker outlook for supply.  As such, the MPC judges that the speed of pass-through from import prices to consumer prices is likely to be somewhat faster than on average over the past (Section 5). Wages and labour costs  Labour costs account for the majority of the domestic cost of production.  The degree to which labour costs, such as wages and non-wage benefits, affect prices will depend on how these costs evolve relative to how much output is being produced — known as unit labour cost growth.  While wage growth has remained weak (Table 4.B), that has occurred alongside weak productivity growth, so unit labour cost pressures within companies have not been as weak  (Chart 4.8).  One factor that is likely to have affected both wage and productivity growth over the recent past — and so perhaps had a limited impact on unit labour costs — has been changes in the composition of the workforce.  The proportion of jobs associated with lower pay and productivity fell during the crisis, which will have boosted average pay and productivity growth over that period (Chart 4.9).  That subsequently began to unwind, with roles associated with lower pay forming a larger-than-usual share of net employment growth.  The effect on wages of the changing composition of the workforce appears, however, to have stabilised over the past year, and Bank staff estimate that the associated drag on wage and productivity growth has therefore diminished. 6  5  4  3  2  1  0  1  2  3  4  5  1998  2002  06  10  14  Percentage point deviation from average since 1998    + – Chart 4.7 Companies’ profit margins have recovered since the crisis Estimated margins on consumer goods and services(a) Sources:  ONS and Bank calculations.

While elevated unemployment following the financial crisis will have depressed wage growth, that effect is likely to have largely diminished as unemployment has fallen back.  There is a possibility, however, that some degree of slack remains in the labour market and is continuing to weigh on wage growth (Section 3).  In addition, falls in global food and energy prices since 2014 have supported growth in households’ real incomes (Section 2) and some contacts of the Bank’s Agents report that this has reduced some of the pressure on companies to increase nominal wages.  It is also possible that an increased ability to hire people from abroad over the past decade could have reduced the sensitivity of wage growth to domestic labour market conditions. Wage growth is projected to remain subdued over the near term reflecting continued weak productivity growth  (Section 3), although there are risks in both directions.  Higher import prices could put upward pressure on wages if employees seek greater pay rises to reduce the hit to their purchasing power.  Conversely, companies could seek to offset the reduction in their margins associated with higher import prices by attempting to push down other costs, including wages. The National Living Wage (NLW), which came into effect in April 2016, will continue to increase wages for some employees in coming years.(1) According to the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, conducted immediately following the introduction of the NLW in April, wage growth towards the lower end of the income distribution appeared to have been a little stronger than previously expected.  The impact of that on aggregate wage growth was small, however, and Bank staff’s estimate of the overall effect of the NLW on wage growth is little changed.  The Bank’s Agents report that companies are seeking to limit the impact on their overall costs;  for example by reducing other aspects of pay, such as overtime payments, or by investing to increase productivity.  The CIPD survey suggests that while some employers are seeking to improve efficiency, the most common response to date has been to absorb higher pay in profit margins.  That could lead to a further drive to reduce costs if companies seek to restore their margins in the face of further rises in the National Living Wage, or some of the additional cost could be reflected in higher prices.

The adjustment for compositional effects is obtained by combining those estimates with changes in the composition of the labour force.  Data are to 2016 Q2. 4.4  Inflation expectations Insofar as inflation expectations affect price or wage-setting decisions, they can also affect the outlook for inflation itself. The MPC monitors a range of indicators to assess whether inflation expectations remain consistent with the MPC’s  2% target. Measures of households’ inflation expectations one year ahead picked up slightly in 2016 Q3 (Table 4.C), and the YouGov/Citigroup measure rose further in October.  Based on past behaviour, survey measures would be expected to respond to actual inflation and the near-term inflation outlook, which are both higher than in August.  In contrast, measures of longer-term expectations either fell a little or were broadly unchanged.  And most measures of both  shorter-term and longer-term expectations remained below their past averages.  It is possible that households’ inflation expectations will remain subdued, and there remains a risk that they settle below levels consistent with the 2% target even as headline inflation rises further.  It is also possible, however, that a period of above-target inflation (Section 5), following the depreciation in sterling, could be associated with expectations rising beyond levels consistent with the inflation target. Companies’ expectations of inflation one year ahead also rose in 2016 Q3 (Table 4.C).  According to the Deloitte survey of chief financial officers (CFOs) of large companies, the dispersion of inflation expectations two years ahead around the inflation target has narrowed since Q2.  A majority of CFOs now expect inflation to be between 1.5% and 2.5% in  two years’ time. Measures of inflation compensation in financial markets — which will, in part, be driven by financial market participants’ inflation expectations — have also risen (Table 4.C).   Short-term measures have picked up steadily over 2016, which is likely to reflect expectations of higher import prices associated with the fall in sterling being passed through to consumer prices.  Inflation compensation five to ten years ahead has also risen since August to around past average levels (Section 1).  The average of professional forecasters’ expectations of inflation over the medium term was little changed on the quarter and also remains in line with its past average.   Overall, the MPC judges that inflation expectations remain well anchored, and indicators of medium-term inflation expectations continue to be broadly consistent with the  2% target.  The MPC will continue to monitor measures of expectations closely as inflation rises (Section 5).

Since August, near-term activity indicators have been better than expected.  Despite that, sterling has again fallen sharply.  That fall appears to have been associated with market participants’ perceptions that the United Kingdom’s future trading arrangements with the European Union might be less open than they previously thought likely.  In the projections in this Report, the MPC has assumed that uncertainty about those arrangements remains elevated throughout the forecast period, weighing on both demand and supply.  That drag is likely to be particularly pronounced for those firms who may be concerned that their access to EU markets could be materially reduced. In the MPC’s best collective judgement, conditional on a path for market interest rates that reaches 0.4% by late 2019, four-quarter GDP growth is likely to slow to around 1½%.  That is stronger in the near term but weaker in the medium term than three months ago.  Supply growth remains subdued so unemployment and slack increase only modestly.  While domestic cost growth rises a little over the forecast period, imported cost pressures increase sharply due to the depreciation of sterling.  As a result, and conditional on the market path for interest rates, inflation is projected to rise above the 2% target within the next twelve months and only begin to fall back in the second half of the three-year forecast period. In August, the MPC revised down significantly its projections for demand and, to a slightly lesser extent, supply following the vote to leave the European Union.  The projection for inflation was nonetheless revised higher, reflecting the impact of the sharp decline in sterling following the referendum. Those projections were published alongside the announcement of the MPC’s August policy package — comprising a cut in Bank Rate, a Term Funding Scheme, £60 billion of gilt purchases and up to £10 billion of corporate bond purchases. The immediate impact of the package on market interest rates and asset prices was somewhat greater than anticipated in August and it has begun to feed through to lower interest rates for households and companies (see the box on pages 2–3). Since the August Report, indicators of growth in the second half of 2016 have been stronger than anticipated, but the sterling exchange rate has declined further.  The implications of these developments for the MPC’s medium-term projections depend on why they have occurred. GDP grew by 0.5% in 2016 Q3 according to the preliminary estimate, down only slightly from the upwardly revised Q2 outturn.  Survey indicators suggest a modest further slowdown in Q4 (Section 2).  That is a much stronger profile for the second half of the year than assumed in the August                                                                                                                                                                 Section 5 Prospects for inflation                                                                                     35 projections.  There are several possible reasons for this. Underlying momentum in the economy may have been greater than previously assumed in the run-up to the referendum.  In addition, indicators of uncertainty have fallen back, although they are still above average levels, following their sharp rises in the summer.  And financial conditions have improved.  The housing market has also been more resilient than previously assumed, consistent with few signs, as yet, of weakness in household spending or consumer sentiment more generally. That suggests consumers have not materially revised down their view of future income prospects since the summer. Despite positive news on the near-term outlook, the sterling ERI fell sharply in October, and is 6½% lower than at the time of the August Report.  By itself, the lower level of sterling would support UK activity.  The fall has, however, been attributed by market contacts to perceptions that the United Kingdom’s future trading arrangements with the European Union might be less open than they previously thought likely.  In its projections, the MPC has assumed that uncertainty about those arrangements remains elevated throughout the forecast period, weighing on both demand and supply.  That drag is likely to be particularly pronounced for those firms who may be concerned that their access to EU markets could be materially reduced. Following the latest fall, sterling is around 20% below its November 2015 peak.  There is evidence that large changes in exchange rates and those associated with changes in supply expectations tend to pass through to consumer prices more quickly (Section 4).  Given the nature of the fall in sterling, the MPC therefore judges that pass-through to CPI inflation will be a little faster than usually assumed.  Even so, the extent of the depreciation means it is likely still to be contributing significantly to inflation by the end of the MPC’s forecast period and is the sole reason why inflation remains above the 2% target at that point. Alongside the fall in sterling, market interest rates have risen (see the box on pages 2–3).  In the fifteen days to 26 October, the yield curve implied a small fall in Bank Rate to just under 0.2% in the near term before rising to 0.4% by late 2019 (Table 5.A).  That profile was 10 basis points higher, on average, than the August Report path, which troughed at 0.1% in early 2017.(1) Longer-term market interest rates — such as (1) Unless otherwise stated, the projections shown in this section are conditioned on: Bank Rate following a path implied by market yields;  the introduction of the Term Funding Scheme (TFS) financed by the issuance of central bank reserves;  the stock of purchased gilts financed by the issuance of central bank reserves reaching £435 billion and remaining there throughout the forecast period;  the stock of purchased corporate bonds financed by the issuance of central bank reserves reaching £10 billion and remaining there throughout the forecast period;  the Recommendations of the Financial Policy Committee and the current regulatory plans of the Prudential Regulation Authority;  the Government’s tax and spending plans as set out in the March 2016 Budget;  commodity prices following market paths;  and the sterling exchange rate remaining broadly flat.

That rise in rates in large part reflects a rise in inflation compensation, to around average levels, rather than higher real yields (Section 1).  In risky asset markets, corporate bond spreads have risen slightly, although they remain lower than before the August Report.  Equity prices remain higher, in part reflecting the support from the lower level of sterling for international companies and, to a lesser extent, a rise in domestic-facing companies’ equity prices. The MPC’s projections, summarised in Table 5.B, are conditioned on the asset prices set out above.  As in August, they are also conditioned on the tax and benefit rates and government spending plans set out in the March 2016 Budget. In the MPC’s central projection four-quarter growth slows over the next few quarters and then remains around 1½% throughout the forecast period (Chart 5.1).  The fall in sterling supports net trade but, by raising import prices, weighs on households’ real incomes and spending, by more than projected in August.  A sustained period of elevated uncertainty holds back companies’ investment.  The slowdown is more drawn out than in the August projection, so GDP growth is higher in the near term, reflecting stronger-than-expected data outturns, and lower further out. Supply growth remains subdued such that slack and unemployment increase only modestly in the projection, and domestic cost growth picks up a little, from relatively low rates.  Higher import prices, following the 20% depreciation of sterling over the past year, however, mean that CPI inflation is judged likely to rise above the 2% target by mid-2017, before peaking at 2¾% a year later and then beginning to fall back in the second half of the forecast period.  Although pass-through is a little faster than in previous projections, the depreciation is judged likely still to be pushing inflation above the MPC’s 2% target at the three-year forecast horizon (Chart 5.2). Ultimately, however, the impact of higher import prices dissipates and so CPI inflation is judged likely to return to close to the target over the following year.  Inflation rises further above the target than in August (Chart 5.3) primarily due to the further fall in sterling. The MPC’s Remit requires that monetary policy should balance the speed with which inflation is returned to the target with the support for real activity.  Developments since August, in particular the direct impact of the further depreciation of sterling on CPI inflation, have adversely affected that trade-off.  This impact will ultimately prove temporary, and attempting to offset it fully with tighter monetary policy would be excessively costly in terms of foregone output and employment growth.  However, there are limits to the extent to which above-target inflation can be tolerated. + – 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 2012 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 Percentage increases in output on a year earlier Projection Bank estimates of past growth ONS data Chart 5.1 GDP projection based on market interest rate expectations, other policy measures as announced The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for GDP growth.  It has been conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.B footnote (b).  To the left of the vertical dashed line, the distribution reflects the likelihood of revisions to the data over the past;  to the right, it reflects uncertainty over the evolution of GDP growth in the future.  If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that the mature estimate of GDP growth would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of those occasions.  The fan chart is constructed so that outturns are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter green areas on 30 occasions.  In any particular quarter of the forecast period, GDP growth is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fan on 90 out of 100 occasions.  And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions GDP growth can fall anywhere outside the green area of the fan chart.  Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey background.

In the MPC’s November forecast, the inflation overshoot is the product of a perceived shock to future supply, which has caused the exchange rate to fall, alongside a modest projected shortfall of activity. Inflation expectations have picked up to around their past average levels and domestic costs have remained contained. Given the projected rise in unemployment, together with the risks around activity and inflation, and the potential for further volatility in asset prices, the MPC judges it appropriate to accommodate a period of above-target inflation.  That notwithstanding, the MPC is monitoring closely the evolution of inflation expectations. At its meeting ending on 2 November, the MPC voted to maintain Bank Rate at 0.25% and agreed that it remained appropriate to continue the previously announced asset purchase programmes, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves.  The factors behind that decision are set out in the Monetary Policy Summary on pages i–ii of this Report, and in more detail in the Minutes of the meeting.(1) The remainder of this section sets out the MPC’s projections, and the risks around them, in more detail. 5.1   The MPC’s key judgements and risks Key Judgement 1:  the fall in sterling supports net trade in the face of modest global growth The MPC’s projections continue to incorporate a small pickup in global growth, although to below average rates (Table 5.C) 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 2012 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 Percentage increase in prices on a year earlier + – Chart 5.2 CPI inflation projection based on market interest rate expectations, other policy measures as announced 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 2012 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 Percentage increase in prices on a year earlier + – Chart 5.3 CPI inflation projection in August based on market interest rate expectations, other policy measures as announced Charts 5.2 and 5.3 depict the probability of various outcomes for CPI inflation in the future.

Developments over the past three months suggest that spillovers to other economies from the UK vote to leave the European Union have been minimal to date.  Partly in light of that, the near-term projection for euro-area growth has been revised up a little (Chart 5.4).  That projection continues to embody modest growth, supported by policy measures. Those measures, alongside the waning drag from past falls in oil prices, also support a pickup in inflation from current low levels. In the United States, activity was a little weaker than expected around the middle of the year.  The labour market has continued to improve, however, and wage growth, as measured by the Employment Cost Index, has picked up. In the central projection, GDP growth recovers during 2017, supported by stronger productivity growth. There has been little news on growth prospects in emerging market economies (EMEs) over the past three months.  The MPC’s projections embody a modest slowing in Chinese GDP growth, to around 6% a year, and some recovery in a number of those economies that have been in recession, including Russia and Brazil.  These paths are sensitive to domestic and global developments.  In China, for example, the growth outlook is likely to be associated with a further expansion in credit, increasing financial vulnerabilities.  More generally, EMEs will remain sensitive to movements in global interest rates.  For example, a more pronounced tightening in US policy rates than embodied in market prices could trigger renewed capital outflows from EMEs. The further 6½% fall in the sterling ERI since August is assumed to raise export growth and lower import growth. The fall in sterling has, however, also been associated with changing market perceptions of the likely outcomes of negotiations with the European Union.  In light of that, companies that may be concerned that their access to EU markets could be materially reduced (see the box on pages 21–22) are judged likely to make more significant adjustments to their operations than previously assumed (Key Judgement 2).  As a result, over the three years of the forecast period, net trade provides a similar degree of support to growth as in August, despite the additional depreciation. Nonetheless, the 20% fall in sterling over the past twelve months means that net trade is judged likely to contribute positively to growth in the first two years of the projection, before that contribution wanes in the third year. There is a near halving in the current account deficit over the next three years as, in addition to improving trade flows, net income flows benefit from the lower value of sterling.

Income flows will also be sensitive to relative rates of return and companies’ choices about where to locate future investments (Key Judgement 2). Key Judgement 2:  heightened uncertainty weighs on investment, and productivity growth remains below past average rates In light of recent developments, in its central projection, the MPC assumes that uncertainty rises somewhat less in the near term than assumed in August but that it remains more elevated further out. Uncertainty is assumed to lead companies to scale back UK investment projects.  It is also associated with continued weakness in commercial real estate activity.  The outlook for investment is, however, supported by relatively high rates of return and the MPC’s policy package, which has contributed to falls in the cost of borrowing for companies.  Reflecting the revised projection for uncertainty, business investment falls less in the near term than projected in August but is weaker further out (Table 5.D), only returning to its 2015 peak towards the end of the forecast period. The period of low investment will reduce growth in the capital stock and therefore productivity.  Uncertainty may cause businesses to postpone some research and development projects that would otherwise have improved productivity (Section 3).  Perceptions of a less open set of trading arrangements, at least for a period, would also be expected to have some negative effect on potential supply growth.(1) Any reorientation of business models, in light of new trading arrangements, may require a reallocation of resources towards new sectors or markets.  This is likely to dampen productivity growth for a period, especially to the extent that there is a reduction in activity in sectors in which the United Kingdom currently has a particular comparative advantage. While the implications for productivity of the transition to new trading arrangements with the European Union are highly uncertain, the MPC’s central judgement is that hourly productivity growth is likely to remain below historical average rates throughout the forecast period (Chart 5.5). In addition, there remains uncertainty about the prospects for productivity globally.  In the United Kingdom and many other countries, productivity has risen little since the financial crisis and projections have been gradually marked down.  It is possible that pent-up gains begin to come through over the forecast period, but it is also possible that productivity here and abroad continues to disappoint.

The latest data, however, suggest little, if any, impact to date (Section 2).  According to the GfK/EC survey, consumer confidence has fallen back a little since early summer but remains firm.  Although official data for consumption in Q3 are not yet available, the output mix of Q3 growth suggests resilient consumer spending.  In the housing market the RICS survey of estate agents suggests that the outcome of the referendum has not had a persistently negative effect on activity. Developments in income are typically the single most significant influence on household spending.  Over the past couple of years, households’ real incomes have been bolstered by a combination of above-average employment growth, a modest recovery in wage growth and falling prices for energy, food and other imported goods and services.  That has been associated with robust consumption growth.  Over the forecast period, nominal income growth remains modest as wage growth picks up (Key Judgement 4) but employment growth slows.  More significantly, higher prices for imported items reduce households’ purchasing power by more than assumed in August, reflecting the further fall in sterling (Key Judgement 4).  In the central projection, annual household real income and consumer spending growth average around 1%, well below their historical average rates (Table 5.D).  The saving ratio continues to fall in the near term and is broadly flat from early 2017 (Chart 5.6).  Any upward impetus from a desire to increase precautionary saving in light of continued uncertainty is judged to be broadly offset by support from lower interest rates. There are risks around the outlook for consumption on both sides.  In the central projection the unemployment rate rises by nearly ¾ percentage points (Chart 5.7).  Increased concerns among households about job security could raise precautionary saving.  In the other direction, it is possible that households will be slower to adjust spending as their purchasing power is eroded — especially in light of supportive credit conditions — such that the saving ratio falls more sharply than assumed. Weaker income prospects are also associated with a less buoyant housing market over the forecast period than in the recent past.  The recent evidence points, however, to a less sharp slowdown than assumed three months ago (Section 2). The central projection incorporates a modest rise in housing investment (Table 5.D) and growth of house prices in line with average earnings (Table 5.E). 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 2012 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 Unemployment rate, per cent   The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for LFS unemployment.  It has been conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.B footnote (b).  The coloured bands have the same interpretation as in Chart 5.2, and portray 90% of the probability distribution.  The calibration of this fan chart takes account of the likely path dependency of the economy, where, for example, it is judged that shocks to unemployment in one quarter will continue to have some effect on unemployment in successive quarters.  The fan begins in 2016 Q3, a quarter earlier than the fan for CPI inflation.  That is because Q3 is a staff projection for the unemployment rate, based in part on data for July and August.  The unemployment rate was 4.9% in the three months to August, and is projected to be 4.9% in Q3 as a whole.  A significant proportion of this distribution lies below Bank staff’s current estimate of the long-term equilibrium unemployment rate.  There is therefore uncertainty about the precise calibration of this fan chart.

The speed and extent to which it rises further in coming quarters will depend in particular on how much and how quickly the fall in sterling feeds through the supply chain, and on developments in domestic costs. The fall of roughly 20% in the sterling exchange rate since November 2015 has begun, and will continue, to raise imported costs.  Some exporters to the United Kingdom may The Committee’s projections are underpinned by four key judgements.  Risks surround all of these, and the MPC will monitor a broad range of variables to understand the degree to which the risks are crystallising.  The table below shows Bank staff’s indicative near-term projections that are consistent with the judgements in the MPC’s central view evolving as expected. Table 5.E Monitoring risks to the Committee’s key judgements Key judgement Likely developments in 2016 Q4 to 2017 Q2 if judgements evolve as expected 1:  the fall in sterling supports net trade in the face of modest global growth • Quarterly euro-area growth to average between ¼% and ½%. • Annual euro-area HICP inflation to increase to above 1% around the turn of the year as past falls in oil prices drop out of the annual calculation. • Quarterly US GDP growth to average a little above ½%. • Annual US PCE inflation to pick up in coming months as past falls in oil prices drop out of the annual calculation, reaching 2% in the first half of 2017. • Indicators of activity consistent with four-quarter PPP-weighted emerging market economy growth of around 4¼%;  within that, Chinese GDP growth to average around 6½%. • Net trade contributes positively to real GDP growth. • The current account deficit narrows to around 5% of GDP in the first half of 2017. 2:  heightened uncertainty weighs on investment, and productivity growth remains below past average rates • Business investment is projected to fall by around ¾% per quarter on average, reflecting the impact of post-referendum uncertainty. • Quarterly growth in hourly productivity of between ¼% and ½%. • Participation rate to fall back slightly, and then remain just below 63¾% during the first half of 2017. • Average hours to fall by just under ½% in the year to 2017 Q2. • Unemployment starts to rise from its current trough, reaching just over 5% by 2017 Q2. 3:  household spending growth slows broadly in line with real incomes • A slowing in real income growth leads quarterly consumption growth to slow gradually to around ¼% per quarter on average. • The household savings ratio to fall by around 0.5 percentage points by mid-2017. • Credit spreads to remain broadly flat. • Mortgage approvals for house purchase to be around 65,000 per month, on average. • Quarterly growth in housing investment to average 0%. • The average of the Halifax and Nationwide price indices is expected to increase by ½% per quarter. 4:  slack weighs on domestic inflationary pressures, but higher import prices take inflation back to the 2% target then above it for a period • Weak productivity growth means that four-quarter growth in whole-economy unit labour costs reaches just under 2% by 2017 Q2. • Commodity prices and sterling ERI to evolve in line with the conditioning assumptions set out in www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/inflationreport/2016/novca.pdf. • Domestic gas and electricity prices are unchanged in the first half of 2017. • Four-quarter AWE growth to remain between 2¼% and 2¾% in the first half of 2017. • Non-fuel import prices to rise by almost 9% in the year to Q2. • Indicators of medium-term inflation expectations continue to be broadly consistent with the 2% target.  42                                                                                                                                                          Inflation Report  November 2016 absorb part of the change in sterling by lowering other costs or accepting lower profits, but past evidence suggests that around 60% of the fall in sterling is likely to be reflected in higher UK non-energy import prices.  Further rises in oil prices since August, in both dollar and sterling terms, also add upward pressure to import prices.  Import price inflation is therefore judged likely to pick up sharply, and to a greater extent than assumed three months ago, primarily due to the further depreciation (Chart 5.8).  There are risks on both sides of that path. The rise in import costs — which represent close to a third of the CPI basket — is expected to be passed through fully to consumer prices over several years.  For some items, such as food, changes in import costs tend to feed through quickly to consumer prices.  For other items, pass-through is more drawn out.  Given the size of the fall in sterling, and its association with a weaker outlook for supply, the MPC judges that pass-through to CPI inflation will be a little quicker than usually assumed, in line with evidence from previous episodes (Section 4).  That increases the contribution of import prices to CPI inflation over the next 18 months and reduces it a little further out, relative to the profile for pass-through in August. In the central projection, the contribution of non-energy import prices is projected to rise to over 1 percentage point in mid-2017, falling back to 2/# percentage points at the end of 2019 and to zero over the following year or so.  The risks to that outlook remain skewed to the upside in the first year.  It is possible that the impact on the CPI could be more pervasive, with the prices of domestically produced goods and services that compete with imports rising faster too. In contrast to imported pressures, domestic cost pressures remain subdued.  In particular, wage growth is still well below pre-crisis average rates, despite unemployment falling back to around its pre-crisis level over recent years.  For the most part, that weakness reflects developments in productivity.  Even adjusting for that, however, and despite some pickup recently, companies’ unit labour costs have been growing at rates below those consistent with meeting the inflation target in the medium term.  In the MPC’s central projection, wage (Table 5.D) and unit labour cost growth rise gradually (Table 5.C) as the impact of past falls in unemployment feed through and inflation picks up. There are two-sided risks around the outlook for labour costs. On the downside, the weakness in wage growth could indicate more domestic slack.  Bank staff estimate that the equilibrium rate of unemployment — that consistent with neither upward nor downward pressure on wage growth — is around 5%, close to the current LFS rate.  If the equilibrium rate were in fact lower, unemployment would exert more downward pressure on wage growth throughout the forecast period.  On the upside, the recent weakness in wage growth could indicate greater sensitivity to current inflation than assumed.

More generally, the projections assume that inflation expectations remain well anchored.  Survey indicators of household inflation expectations remain around or below average at longer horizons (Section 4).  Medium-term financial market measures of inflation compensation are around their averages, having risen sharply over the past month or so.  With inflation further above the target than in August throughout the forecast period, it will be important to monitor medium to long-term inflation expectations closely for any signs of upward drift.  Any substantial drift up could lead to changes in domestic wage and price-setting behaviour, which would make it harder to return inflation to the 2% target in the medium term. 5.2  The projections for demand, unemployment and inflation Based on these judgements and the risks around them, and conditioned on the path for Bank Rate based on market yields, four-quarter GDP growth is projected to slow in the near term and remain around 1½% further out.  The lower sterling exchange rate supports net trade but, acting against that, companies begin to adjust activity in light of anticipated changes to future trading relationships.  Uncertainty about the nature of those relationships holds back business investment, which falls in the near term and recovers only modestly further out.  That weighs on productivity growth, as do adjustments to production processes, and it remains below historical average rates.  Households’ spending grows at a slower rate than recently, as their purchasing power is eroded by the fall in sterling, and unemployment rises, reaching just over 5½% by the end of the forecast period (Chart 5.7). Near-term growth is stronger than in August, reflecting upside news in the data (Table 5.F).  The medium-term projection is lower (Chart 5.9), reflecting slower real income growth, a more persistent drag from uncertainty and the likelihood of more significant adjustments to activity by companies in some sectors.  That change in the pattern of growth reflects a more drawn out adjustment than in August, with the level of output only slightly lower at the three-year horizon.  As in August, uncertainty around the outlook is greater than usual, and the fan around the growth projection remains wider than in May, but the risks are judged to be balanced, rather than tilted to the downside. Conditional on a path for Bank Rate that reaches 0.4% by late 2019, domestic inflationary pressures build to levels typically consistent with inflation at the target.  The lower level of sterling is, however, assumed to raise import and, in turn, consumer prices.

Inflation is therefore judged likely to rise sharply above the target over the next twelve months and still to exceed the MPC’s 2% target at the three-year forecast horizon, before falling back to the target beyond then.  It is possible that pass-through of higher import prices will occur more rapidly than in the central projection, so the risks are skewed to the upside in the near term (Table 5.G).  Taking the risks and the central projection together, inflation is judged significantly more likely to be above the 2% target than below it in two to three years’ time (Chart 5.10).  Inflation rises further above the target than in August (Chart 5.11) given the further depreciation, together with higher oil prices, but peaks sooner given the assumption of faster pass-through. Charts 5.12 and 5.13 show the MPC’s projections under the alternative constant rate assumption, and the policy package announced by the MPC.  That assumption is that Bank Rate remains at 0.25% throughout the three years of the forecast period, before rising towards the market path over the subsequent three years.  Under that path, the outlooks for GDP growth and CPI inflation are broadly similar to those under the market path. 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 2012 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 Percentage increases in output on a year earlier Projection   Bank estimates of past growth   ONS data   + – See footnote to Chart 5.1.

Relative to August, the range of forecasts for GDP growth one year ahead has narrowed, but has widened for forecasts three years ahead (Chart A).  Respondents, on average, expected the unemployment rate to increase over the next two years, albeit to a lesser extent than projected in August. The average of respondents’ central expectations for CPI inflation in three years’ time remained stable at 2.1% (Chart B).  Average expectations in one year’s time, however, continued to increase to 2.6%.  Sterling was projected, on average, to be around 4% higher than the conditioning path underlying the MPC’s forecast (Table 1). The path for Bank Rate implied by the average of external forecasters’ central expectations was little changed from at the time of the August Report and broadly similar to the market path.  The stock of gilt purchases was, on average, expected to be higher than the £435 billion announced in August (Table 1), with a 44% weight placed on the stock being £475 billion or higher in three years’ time (Chart C).  Respondents also placed a 33% weight on the stock of corporate bonds being £15 billion or higher in three years’ time, compared with the £10 billion announced in August.

2017-08-03,"Inflation Report August 2017   In order to maintain price stability, the Government has set the Bank’s Monetary Policy  Committee (MPC) a target for the annual inflation rate of the Consumer Prices Index of 2%.   Subject to that, the MPC is also required to support the Government’s economic policy,  including its objectives for growth and employment. The Inflation Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff under the guidance of the members of  the Monetary Policy Committee.  It serves two purposes.  First, its preparation provides a  comprehensive and forward-looking framework for discussion among MPC members as an aid  to our decision-making.  Second, its publication allows us to share our thinking and explain the  reasons for our decisions to those whom they affect. Although not every member will agree with every assumption on which our projections are  based, the fan charts represent the MPC’s best collective judgement about the most likely paths  for inflation, output and unemployment, as well as the uncertainties surrounding those central  projections. This Report has been prepared and published by the Bank of England in accordance with  section 18 of the Bank of England Act 1998. The Monetary Policy Committee: Mark Carney, Governor Ben Broadbent, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy Jon Cunliffe, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Andrew Haldane Ian McCafferty Michael Saunders Silvana Tenreyro Gertjan Vlieghe The Inflation Report is available in PDF alongside PowerPoint™ versions of the charts and  Excel spreadsheets of the data underlying most of them at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/inflationreport/2017/aug.aspx.

At its  meeting ending on 2 August 2017, the MPC voted by a majority of 6–2 to maintain Bank Rate  at 0.25%.  The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial  investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank  reserves, at £10 billion.  The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of  UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £435 billion.  The Committee voted unanimously to close the drawdown period for the  Term Funding Scheme (TFS) on 28 February 2018, as envisaged when the scheme was  introduced. The MPC’s overall assessment of the outlook for inflation and activity in the August Inflation Report is broadly similar to  that in May.  In the MPC’s central forecast, GDP growth remains sluggish in the near term as the squeeze on households’  real incomes continues to weigh on consumption.  Growth then picks up to just above its reduced potential rate over the  balance of the forecast period.  Net trade and business investment firm up, and consumption growth recovers in line with  modestly rising household incomes.  Net trade is bolstered by strong global growth and the past depreciation of sterling.   The combination of high rates of profitability, especially in the export sector, the low cost of capital and limited spare  capacity supports investment by UK firms over the forecast period, offsetting the effect of continued uncertainties  around Brexit. CPI inflation rose to 2.6% in June from 2.3% in March, as expected.  The MPC expects inflation to rise further in coming  months and to peak around 3% in October, as the past depreciation of sterling continues to pass through to consumer  prices.  Conditional on the current market yield curve, inflation is projected to remain above the MPC’s target throughout  the forecast period.  This overshoot reflects entirely the effects of the referendum-related falls in sterling.  As the effect  of rising import prices on inflation diminishes, domestic inflationary pressures gradually pick up over the forecast period.   As slack is absorbed, wage growth is projected to recover.  In addition, margins in the consumer sector, having been  squeezed by the pickup in import prices, are projected to be rebuilt.  Consequently, inflation remains at a level slightly  above the 2% target.   As in previous Reports, the MPC’s projections are conditioned on the average of a range of possible outcomes for the  United Kingdom’s eventual trading relationship with the European Union.  The projections also assume that, in the  interim, households and companies base their decisions on the expectation of a smooth adjustment to that new trading  relationship.  Other important judgements include:  that the lower level of sterling continues to boost consumer prices  broadly as projected, and without adverse consequences for inflation expectations further ahead;  that regular pay  growth remains modest in the near term but picks up over the forecast period;  and that subdued household spending  growth is largely balanced by a pickup in other components of demand.   Monetary policy cannot prevent either the necessary real adjustment as the United Kingdom moves towards its new  international trading arrangements or the weaker real income growth that is likely to accompany that adjustment over  the next few years.  Attempting to offset fully the effect of weaker sterling on inflation would be achievable only at the  cost of higher unemployment and, in all likelihood, even weaker income growth.  For this reason, the MPC’s remit  specifies that, in exceptional circumstances, the Committee must balance any trade-off between the speed at which it  intends to return inflation sustainably to the target and the support that monetary policy provides to jobs and activity.    ii	 Inflation Report  August 2017 Through most of the forecast period, the economy operates with a small degree of spare capacity and CPI inflation is well  above the target.  By the end of the forecast, that trade-off is eliminated.  Spare capacity is fully absorbed, and inflation  remains above the target.   The Committee judges that, given the assumptions underlying its projections including the closure of the drawdown  period of the TFS, and allowing for the effects of the recent prudential decisions of the Financial Policy Committee and  the Prudential Regulation Authority, some tightening of monetary policy would be required to achieve a sustainable  return of inflation to the target.  Specifically, if the economy follows a path broadly consistent with the August central  projection, then monetary policy could need to be tightened by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than  the path implied by the yield curve underlying the August projections.   In light of these considerations, six members thought that the current policy stance remained appropriate to balance the  demands of the MPC’s remit.  Two members considered it appropriate to increase Bank Rate by 25 basis points.  All  members agreed that any increases in Bank Rate would be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent.  The  Committee will continue to monitor closely the incoming evidence, and stands ready to respond to changes in the  economic outlook as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target.  	 Section 1  Global economic and financial market developments	 1 1	 Global economic and financial  market developments The outlook for the global economy has improved in recent quarters, as growth has picked up and  its composition has rotated towards investment.  The improving outlook, alongside greater investor  risk appetite, has supported rises in equity and corporate bond prices over the past year.  Financial  market prices imply that UK and euro-area policy rates are expected to rise more quickly than they  had been in May, although the pace remains gradual.  Sterling’s exchange rate has fallen slightly  since May and remains significantly below its level prior to the EU referendum. Global GDP growth is estimated to have risen further in  2017 Q2 and is projected to be stable in coming quarters  (Section 1.1).  Part of the pickup in growth since 2016 H1 has  been accounted for by a recovery in investment growth  (Chart 1.1), which should support the outlook for activity  further ahead.  While the near-term outlook is broadly  unchanged since May, it remains stronger than projected in  earlier Reports.  Despite further falls in unemployment across a  number of countries, wage growth and global inflation remain  relatively subdued (Section 1.2). Improvements in the outlook for global growth have been  reflected in rising equity prices and narrower corporate bond  spreads.  Benchmark market interest rates have increased  (Section 1.3).  Despite the firmer global backdrop, investors  appear to have marked down UK growth prospects since the  EU referendum.  The sterling ERI has remained 15%–20%  below its late-2015 peak.  In addition, the risk premium on  UK equities does not appear to have fallen in line with  international equivalents.  The market‑implied path for  Bank Rate rises only very gradually over the next three years,  albeit by slightly more than in the run-up to the May Report.  1.1	 Developments in global activity Quarterly global GDP growth, weighted by countries’ shares  in UK exports, is estimated to have picked up from 0.6% in  2017 Q1 to 0.7% in Q2.  Euro-area growth has continued to  strengthen, while US growth recovered in Q2 from an  erratically weak Q1 (Table 1.A).  Growth in emerging market  economies (EMEs) is expected to have been stable in 2017 H1,  having slowed in recent years. A range of indicators suggest continued momentum in global  growth in the near term.  Global survey indicators of output  and new orders remain robust.  Business and consumer  confidence are also buoyant, particularly in the euro area and  United States (Chart 1.2).

While that largely reflects stronger trade growth  across EMEs, trade growth also appears to be recovering across  advanced economies.  As the recovery has progressed, the composition of  advanced‑economy GDP growth appears to have rotated  towards investment (Chart 1.4).  Consumption growth was  the main driver of the recovery in recent years, but investment  growth has gathered pace since late 2016.  Historically,  investment growth has been relatively synchronised across  advanced economies (Chart 1.1).  A rise in US and euro-area  capital goods orders in the first half of this year suggests that  the pickup in investment growth is likely to be sustained in the  near term.  The level of advanced-economy investment  remains low, however.  That means growth in the capital stock  remains subdued, which will continue to drag on global  productivity growth. The euro area Quarterly euro-area GDP growth has strengthened over the  past twelve months, and at 0.6% in 2017 Q2 was around its  pre-crisis average rate (Table 1.A).  The pickup in growth has  been broad-based across countries and accounted for by  stronger private domestic demand, particularly business  investment.  Alongside accommodative monetary policy and  easing credit conditions, GDP growth appears to have been  supported by improving business and consumer confidence  (Chart 1.2).   Euro-area growth is projected to remain a little above ½% per  quarter in the near term.  That is consistent with continued  robust survey indicators of near-term activity and confidence.   The pace of growth should also support a continued increase  in employment.  The euro-area unemployment rate has fallen  to 9.1% and is projected to continue to fall slightly in the  near term.  The United States US GDP growth has been broadly stable in recent years, with  growth continuing to average around ½% per quarter in  2017 H1 (Table 1.A).  There was, however, some volatility in  growth, as temporary factors depressed consumption growth  in Q1.  Looking through that, consumption has been a little  weaker than expected in May, perhaps in part reflecting  continued subdued wage growth (Section 1.2).  In contrast,  investment growth has been strong and broadly in line with  expectations. Quarterly US GDP growth is expected to remain around ½%  in the second half of this year.  With the US unemployment  rate close to its pre-crisis trough, it appears that slack in the  US labour market has largely been absorbed.  The  sustainability of US growth is therefore likely to depend in  large part on productivity trends.

Section 1  Global economic and financial market developments	 3 begun to pick up, but only gradually, and it remains  significantly below pre-crisis rates.  Business investment  growth in the United States has tended to outperform that  in other advanced economies over recent years, and should  support US productivity growth over time.  Emerging market economies Four-quarter growth in China has been broadly stable over  the past two years and was 6.9% in 2017 Q2 (Table 1.A).   Industrial production growth has been strong, in part  reflecting the strength of global demand.  Domestic demand  growth has also been resilient, although that has been  supported by rapid credit growth, raising concerns about  financial stability over the medium term.  There remain  significant challenges for the authorities in maintaining current  rates of GDP growth while managing and reducing those risks  to financial stability.(1)   Having slowed significantly in preceding years, growth in  other EMEs has continued to recover over the past year.   Russia and Brazil, which have accounted for much of the  slowing in recent years, appear to have emerged from  recession, although the outlook for Brazil remains  vulnerable to political risks.  Recoveries in world trade  and advanced‑economy demand growth should also help  to support EME growth.  Nevertheless, growth is expected  to remain below pre‑crisis rates.  Growth in many EMEs has been supported by an easing in  financial conditions and, for commodity exporters, the rise in  commodity prices since early 2016 (Section 1.2).  Net inflows  of private sector capital into EMEs have picked up slightly in  the first half of this year and EME equity prices have risen  further.  Several major EMEs appear to have increased their  resilience to macroeconomic shocks, with current account  deficits narrowing, foreign exchange reserves rising, and  government finances becoming somewhat less reliant on  commodity production. 1.2	 Commodity markets and developments  in inflation The improving outlook for global economic activity appears  to have pushed up some commodity prices.  In particular,  industrial metals prices have risen slightly since May and are  significantly higher than a year ago (Chart 1.5).  By contrast, oil prices have fallen in recent months as  developments in oil supply appear to have outweighed  stronger demand prospects.  US dollar oil prices have fallen by  8% since the run-up to the May Report (Chart 1.5).

Although  OPEC agreed in May to extend supply cuts until March 2018,  the International Energy Agency expects non-OPEC  production, including that in the United States, to grow  broadly in line with global demand next year.  Past rises in commodity prices have pushed up measures  of headline consumer price inflation in the euro area,  United States and more widely (Table 1.B).  That largely  reflects a rise in global oil prices in the first half of 2016,  following falls in 2014–15 (Chart 1.5).  As those rises have  started to drop out of the annual comparison, however, the  boost to headline inflation has begun to diminish.  Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, remains  subdued in the euro area and United States (Table 1.B).  The  extent of that weakness has to some degree been masked  recently by erratic factors.  Euro-area inflation had been  boosted temporarily by the timing of Easter holidays relative  to 2016, but that effect has now unwound.  US core inflation  had been pushed up by a sharp rise in prescription drug prices.   That has now fallen out of the annual inflation rate, although a  decline in the cost of mobile phone services is depressing core  inflation at present.  One indicator of core inflation in the medium term is  developments in companies’ wage cost pressures.  US wage  growth picked up during 2014, but has remained broadly  stable since then at a somewhat subdued rate (Chart 1.6).   Euro‑area wage growth has remained weak in recent years,  perhaps reflecting a persistent degree of labour market slack.   With unemployment set to decline further in the euro area,  however, and seemingly little slack in the United States at  present, wage growth and broader inflationary pressures are  projected to increase.  That said, there is some uncertainty  around how quickly and the extent to which wage growth will  pick up.  Inflation trends globally have some bearing on those in the  United Kingdom.  Annual world export price inflation  excluding oil picked up sharply in 2017 Q1, and is expected to  have remained elevated in Q2 at 3.6% (Table 1.B).  That is  pushing up UK import price inflation (Section 4), as is the past  fall in sterling.  But as past rises in commodity prices begin to  drop out of the annual comparison, and the more recent falls  in oil prices are passed through into lower input costs for other  goods, world export price inflation is expected to slow around  the turn of the year.   1.3	 Developments in financial markets The improvement in global economic prospects and investors’  perceptions of risks around the outlook have been key drivers  of financial asset prices.   0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 2000 03 06 09 12 15 Percentage changes on a year earlier United States(a)  Euro area(b)  Chart 1.6  US and euro-area wage growth remain  subdued Euro-area and US wages Sources:  Eurostat, Thomson Reuters Datastream, US Bureau of Economic Analysis and  Bank calculations.

Section 1  Global economic and financial market developments	 5 Interest rates The improving growth outlook has been reflected in higher  market interest rates across advanced economies over the  past year.  And UK and euro-area long-term interest rates  (Chart 1.7) and market-implied paths for policy rates  (Chart 1.8) have risen further since May.  In contrast,  US market interest rates were broadly unchanged over  the past three months, although they remain higher than  a year ago.  In the United States, the Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) in June again raised the target range for the federal  funds rate, to between 1% and 1¼%.  The median FOMC  member’s projection is for the federal funds rate to rise to a  little below 3% by the end of 2019.  The FOMC also  announced that, subject to economic conditions, it expects to  begin to unwind its asset purchase programme.  Market  interest rates imply that the pace of rate rises will slow over  the next few years (Chart 1.8), to a level below the median  FOMC member’s policy rate projection.  The European Central Bank (ECB) has made no changes to  policy rates or its asset purchase programme since May.  In  July, the ECB reiterated that it would continue its programme  of asset purchases until December 2017 and market contacts  expect them to continue beyond that point but with a  reduction in the pace of purchase.  The market-implied path  for policy rates steepened somewhat towards the end of June,  but still rises only gradually over the next three years  (Chart 1.8). In the United Kingdom, the market-implied path for Bank Rate  reaches 0.8% in three years’ time, around 20 basis points  higher than at the time of the May Report (Chart 1.8).  Within  that, a full 25 basis point rise in Bank Rate is now implied by  late 2018. The MPC voted 5–3 to make no changes to monetary policy  at its June meeting, as set out in the box on page 6.  Market  contacts attributed subsequent rises in interest rate  expectations to changes in the balance of policy votes and  later communications by MPC members.  The details of the  August decision are contained in the Monetary Policy  Summary on pages i–ii of this Report, and in more detail  in the Minutes of the meeting. Market-implied paths continue to suggest that policy rates in  advanced economies will rise only gradually in coming years  (Chart 1.8), and long-term government bond yields remain  historically low (Chart 1.7).  These low levels of long-term  interest rates are likely in part to reflect continued subdued  expectations for long-term growth, and the risk of even  weaker growth, despite the recent improvement in  nearer‑term prospects.  But low levels of long-term interest  rates are also likely to reflect structural shifts in global  1.0 0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2013 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Per cent United Kingdom Euro area United States Solid lines:  August Report  Dashed lines:  May Report  ECB deposit rate ECB main reﬁnancing rate Federal funds rate(b) Bank Rate + – Chart 1.8  Market-implied paths for short-term rates  have risen in the United Kingdom and euro area International forward interest rates(a) Sources:  Bank of England, Bloomberg, European Central Bank (ECB) and Federal Reserve.

Table 1.C  Monitoring the MPC’s key judgements  6	 Inflation Report  August 2017 Monetary policy since the May Report The MPC’s central projection in the May Report was for  four-quarter GDP growth to slow over 2017, settling at around  1¾% over the rest of the forecast period.  Subdued  consumption growth was projected to be largely balanced by  rising net trade and investment.  Inflation was projected to  remain above the 2% target, reflecting higher import prices  stemming from the past depreciation of sterling.  Conditional  on the path for Bank Rate implied by market interest rates  prevailing at the time, wage growth and domestic price  pressures were projected to pick up over the forecast, such  that inflation was projected to be rising in the third year even  as external price pressures faded.  That central projection was  also conditioned on the announced Term Funding Scheme,  and on the stocks of purchased gilts and corporate bonds  remaining at £435 billion and £10 billion respectively. At its meeting ending on 14 June, the MPC noted that  GDP growth had declined markedly in 2017 Q1, in part  reflecting weaker household spending.  It remained to be seen  how large and persistent this slowdown in consumption would  prove, with mixed signals from various indicators.  For  instance, there had been further signs of a slowing in the  housing market but consumer confidence had remained  relatively resilient.  Surveys of exports and investment,  however, were fairly upbeat.  That in part reflected robust  near-term momentum in global activity. CPI inflation had reached 2.9% in May, and core inflation had  also risen.  Both stood at rates above the MPC’s expectations  at the time of the May Report.  In contrast, wage growth had  moderated further in April from already subdued rates, even as  the unemployment rate had fallen to 4.6%. The MPC’s May projections showed that the economy was  expected to operate with a small degree of spare capacity for  most of the forecast period, justifying the tolerance of some  degree of above-target inflation.  The continued growth of  employment could suggest that spare capacity was being  eroded, lessening the trade-off the MPC was required to  balance.  Key considerations would be the evolution of  inflationary pressures, the persistence of weaker consumption  and the degree to which it was offset by other components of  demand.  In light of those considerations, five members  thought the current policy stance remained appropriate to  balance that trade-off.  Three members considered it  appropriate to increase Bank Rate by 25 basis points.  All  members agreed that any increases in Bank Rate were  expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent.  investment and saving preferences, due to factors such as the  increasing average age of the global population.(1)  Exchange rates Changes in relative growth prospects and interest rates tend  to be associated with movements in exchange rates.  Amid  improving euro-area growth prospects, the euro has  appreciated against a range of currencies in recent months,  including sterling (Chart 1.9).   Sterling has remained around 15%–20% below its  November 2015 peak since the EU referendum (Chart 1.9).   In the run-up to the August Report, the sterling ERI was 2%  lower than at the time of the May Report, and 18% below  its peak.  Market contacts ascribe much of the fall to changes  in investors’ perceptions of the UK growth outlook and risks  around the United Kingdom’s departure from the  European Union. Corporate capital markets Developments in capital markets matter for the ease and cost  of raising finance for companies.

Model-based estimates of equity risk premia,  which aim to capture the additional return that investors  demand over and above the returns on government bonds,  have fallen significantly since mid-2016 for US and euro-area  equities (Chart 1.11).  In addition, measures of implied asset  price volatility — one set of indicators of financial market  uncertainty and risk aversion — have also fallen, although  as explained in the box on page 8 these indicators can be  influenced by other factors. The cost of debt financing through capital markets also  remains low.  Companies issuing debt typically pay a spread  relative to government bond yields, to compensate investors  for additional risk.  While government bond yields have risen  over the past year (Chart 1.7), spreads on corporate bonds  have narrowed (Chart 1.12).  Moreover, the spreads on  corporate bonds for riskier ‘high‑yield’ companies have  narrowed by more than for other companies.  Those  developments probably reflect a reduction in downside risks  to the global outlook following the recent period of steady  growth (Section 1.1), and increased investor appetite for risk.   Compared with those in the euro area and United States,  risky assets in the United Kingdom have underperformed.   An estimate of the risk premium on equities within the  FTSE All‑Share index is broadly unchanged from a year ago,  in contrast to the falls in risk premia for other major global  equity indices (Chart 1.11).  Much of the rise in the  FTSE All‑Share index (Chart 1.10) appears instead to have  reflected a sharper rise in earnings expectations.  In turn, that  probably stems from the boost to the sterling value of foreign  currency profits due to the depreciation, rather than a  relatively greater improvement in their underlying earnings. Within the FTSE All‑Share, the equity prices of UK-focused  companies have not risen to the same extent as for other  companies (Chart 1.13).  And the spreads on high-yield  sterling bonds, which are more likely to be issued by  domestically focused firms, have narrowed but by less than  their dollar and euro equivalents since early 2016 (Chart 1.12).    Bank funding costs Capital markets also matter for broader credit conditions  through their influence on bank funding costs.  While market  interest rates have risen in recent quarters, the spreads that  banks pay for funding over and above benchmark interest rates  have continued to narrow (Chart 1.14), largely reflecting the  broader improvement in investor risk sentiment.  At its June meeting, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC)  decided to increase the countercyclical capital buffer rate,  levied on banks’ total risk-weighted UK assets, from 0% to  0.5% and said that it expected — absent a material change in  + – 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 2014 15 16 17 Differences from 2014 averages (percentage points) S&P 500 Euro Stoxx FTSE   All-Share May Report Chart 1.11  Equity risk premia have fallen significantly over  the past year in the euro area and United States but not the  United Kingdom Estimates of international equity risk premia(a) Sources:  Bloomberg, IMF WEO, Thomson Reuters Datastream and Bank calculations.

The cost of finance for companies will depend, in part, on  investors’ willingness to take on risk and their perceptions of  the degree of risk.  One set of financial market-based measures of investor  uncertainty and risk aversion are implied volatilities.  These  measures have fallen over the past year.  For example, the  VIX measure of implied equity volatility, derived from  S&P 500 stock index option prices, is close to its historical  lows (Chart A).  And this trend has broadly been replicated  in implied volatilities for a wider range of financial assets,  including bonds and currencies.  The current low level of implied volatilities may, however, be  understating the degree of uncertainty influencing investors’  decisions.  Other measures of uncertainty, such as the Baker,  Bloom and Davis index of global economic policy uncertainty  based on media citations, are above average at present  (Chart A).  That index has tended to be closely correlated with  financial market measures of uncertainty in the past.(1) One reason why implied volatilities may be understating  uncertainty is if they are affected by particular market-based  factors.  One factor that may have lowered implied volatilities  in recent years is investors using option-based strategies to  generate higher returns in the low interest rate environment.   In particular, there are reports of some investors becoming  more willing to sell insurance against rises or falls in asset  prices to generate additional revenue.  This may have reduced  the price of that insurance and therefore the level of implied  volatility calculated from them.  Underlying perceptions of risk  could therefore be higher than indicated by measures of  implied volatility, although a greater willingness to sell  insurance relative to demand could also suggest an increase in  risk appetite among investors.      In addition, the options underlying these estimates of implied  volatilities tend to be traded over shorter horizons than those  over which investment decisions are made.  The VIX measure,  for example, only reflects uncertainty over the next 30 days.   So these measures may be less affected by longer-term risks,  even though those risks may be affecting other asset prices  and investment decisions.  Nevertheless, market contacts primarily point to positive  global growth developments to explain the recent continued  decline in implied volatilities.  A global economy seemingly on  a firmer footing may have alleviated some of the uncertainty  around the outlook.  In addition, low levels of implied volatility  could reflect perceptions that the global economy is less  vulnerable to shocks than it may have been in the recent past.   For example, a more resilient financial system should reduce  the risk that negative economic developments will be  amplified through a tightening in financial conditions.  Low  implied volatilities may also be associated with investors’  belief in the ability of monetary policy makers to mitigate  downside risks to growth. Overall, the current low levels of implied volatilities are likely  to reflect to some extent an improvement in risk sentiment  among investors, which should help to support financing  conditions for companies.  Many of these measures of  uncertainty can be volatile, however, and subject to sudden  shifts in sentiment.

Much of that slowing appears to have been driven  by weaker growth in household spending, as sterling’s depreciation weighed on real income growth.   Net trade has been volatile, but the depreciation and the strength in global demand are expected to  provide support.  Business investment growth has picked up a little and, together with net trade, is  projected to offset part of the weakness from household spending.  Sterling has depreciated sharply since the EU referendum and,  in the run‑up to the August Report, was 18% lower than its  November 2015 peak.  That is raising UK import prices  (Section 4), reducing households’ purchasing power and  weighing on their consumption.  Combined with the strength  of global demand, however, the depreciation should also  support growth in exports and investment in export capacity.   A key factor affecting the outlook for GDP growth is the  extent to which lower growth in household spending is offset  by net trade and business investment growth.  That will also  be influenced by how households and companies anticipate  and respond to the prospect of the United Kingdom’s  departure from the European Union. GDP growth slowed sharply in 2017 Q1, to 0.2% (Chart 2.1),  and remained sluggish at 0.3% in Q2.  The GDP backcast,  which takes into account the revision properties of the official  data and information from business surveys, suggests that  growth in Q1 was higher, at 0.4%.  The MPC projects growth  to be unrevised at 0.3% in Q2. The slowdown in growth since 2016 has been mainly  accounted for by slower growth in service sector output.  That  is likely in part to reflect weak growth in household  consumption (Section 2.1), although output in  consumer‑facing sectors such as retail trade bounced back  somewhat in Q2.  Consumption is projected to remain  subdued in coming quarters, as real income growth remains  weak and households continue to adjust to past falls in their  purchasing power. According to official estimates, manufacturing output fell a  little in Q2, reflecting a decline in motor vehicle production.   Manufacturing activity is expected to improve in the near  term, however, reflecting the support to UK exports from  sterling’s depreciation and the strength in global demand  (Section 2.2).  That may also provide some support to business  investment by firms in the tradable sector of the economy  (Section 2.3). + – 0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2012 13 14 15 16 17 Projection(c) Percentage changes on a quarter earlier Projection for   preliminary GDP   at the time of the   May Report GDP  Estimate implied by the mode   of the latest backcast(b) Chart 2.1  GDP growth is expected to remain subdued in Q3 Output growth and Bank staff’s near‑term projection(a) Sources:  ONS and Bank calculations.

Section 2  Demand and output	 11 GDP growth is projected to remain at 0.3% in Q3.  Survey  indicators of expected activity growth weakened somewhat in  Q2 (Chart 2.2), which on its own would point to a slight  slowing in growth in Q3.  Set against that, however, the levels  of survey indicators of current and expected growth have been  consistent with stronger growth than the official data in recent  quarters.  Much of that strength relative to the official data is  concentrated in the manufacturing sector and is at odds with  the fall in manufacturing output in Q2. 2.1	 Household spending The 18% depreciation of sterling since November 2015 is  raising UK import prices (Section 4) and weighing on  household real income growth (Chart 2.3).  The pace at which  households moderate their spending in response will be a key  determinant of the outlook for overall GDP growth. Household spending growth slowed in Q1 to 0.4% (Table 2.A).  That was slightly stronger than expected in May, and much  stronger than total household real income which fell by 1.3%  in Q1.  As a consequence, the household saving ratio fell from  3.3% to 1.7%, its lowest level since the series began in 1963. Part of the sharp fall in real income was caused by a temporary  increase in the amount paid in taxes on dividends, however.   The effective rate of tax on dividends was raised in April 2016.   That led to some dividend payments being brought forward  ahead of that date, much of the tax on which was paid in  2017 Q1.  Tax payments are expected to have fallen back in  Q2, and so real income and the saving ratio are expected to  have bounced back slightly.  As described in the box on  pages 16–17 of the May Report, the ONS has announced  changes to the measurement of dividend income ahead of  Blue Book 2017 which mean that the amount of dividend  income received by households — and hence the saving ratio  — will be revised up.  Revised estimates for recent years will be  published in August 2017.(1) Indicators of household spending in Q2 have been mixed.   Retail sales picked up, following a fall in Q1.  And energy  consumption is likely to have weighed on overall consumption  growth by less than in Q1, when it was weaker than usual as a  result of relatively warmer weather.  But spending on larger  items, such as cars, appears to have fallen.  Private new car  registrations, for example, fell by 16% in the three months to  June relative to a year earlier (Chart 2.4), although part of that  fall is likely to have reflected the impact of changes to vehicle  tax rates that came into effect in April.  In addition, contacts of  the Bank’s Agents reported that spending on large items such  as homeware has slowed, and respondents to the  (1)	 For more details, see www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/ articles/nationalaccountsarticles/improvingthehouseholdprivatenonfinancial corporationsandnonprofitsinstitutionsservinghouseholdssectorsnonfinancialaccounts. + – 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 2011 12 13 14 15 16 17 Nominal labour income(a) Prices(d) Beneﬁts and transfers(b) Income taxes Non-labour income(c) Real post-tax income growth   (per cent)(e) Percentage points Chart 2.3  Rising import prices have weighed on  household real income growth Contributions to four-quarter real post-tax income growth (a)	 Wages and salaries plus mixed income.

The pace at which households adjust their consumption to  slowing rates of real income growth will depend on a number  of factors.  In the short run, households may change the  amount they save or borrow to allow for only a gradual  adjustment.  The extent to which households can do that,  however, will depend in part on their current holdings of  savings and debt, which vary significantly across households  (see the box on pages 14–15). The extent to which households borrow in order to fund  spending may also be affected by consumer credit conditions.   These have eased in recent years, as banks’ funding costs have  fallen (Section 1) and competition between lenders has  increased.  Interest rates on a £10,000 personal loan are close  to record lows (Table 2.B) and the average interest‑free period  on credit card balance transfers has doubled since 2011.   Lenders responding to the Credit Conditions Survey reported  that unsecured credit availability had tightened modestly in  Q2 and was expected to tighten further in Q3,(1) although the  level of competition between lenders remains strong. Four‑quarter growth in consumer credit has slowed slightly  since late 2016, although it remained high at around 10% in  Q2 (Chart 2.5).  Dealership car finance accounted for a little  over a third of that growth, with the remainder accounted for  by credit card and other borrowing, such as personal loans.(2)   The Prudential Regulation Authority’s (PRA’s) review of  consumer credit lending, published in July, found that the  resilience of lenders’ consumer credit portfolios had been  falling.(3)  Lenders with material exposures to consumer credit  will be asked to respond to that review.  In addition, the  Financial Policy Committee (FPC) is bringing forward the  assessment of stressed losses on consumer credit lending in  the Bank’s 2017 annual stress test, in order to inform the  assessment at its next meeting of any additional resilience  required in aggregate against this lending.  The FPC increased  the countercyclical capital buffer rate, levied on banks’ total  risk‑weighted UK assets, from 0% to 0.5%.  It expected —  absent a material change in the outlook — to raise the rate to  1% at its November meeting (Section 1).(4) The pace at which households adjust their spending growth in  response to the squeeze in real incomes will also depend on  their expectations for future income growth.

Section 2  Demand and output	 13 consumer confidence fell in June to a little below its historical  average and remained there in July (Chart 2.4).  That fall was  driven by lower household confidence in the general economic  situation, as well as a fall in the net balance of households  reporting that now is the right time to make major purchases.   In contrast, the net balance of households expecting their  financial situation to improve over the year ahead has  remained broadly unchanged, at a little above its past average. The housing market can also reflect households’ income  expectations, since those expectations tend to affect the  amount households are willing to spend on a new home.   Activity and house price inflation have weakened further since  May and are projected to remain weak in coming quarters (see  the box on pages 17–18).  These developments are consistent  with subdued household spending growth in the near term. Overall, consumption growth is projected to remain subdued  in coming quarters, broadly as expected in May (Table 2.C).   That reflects continued weak real income growth due to rises  in import prices (Section 4) and subdued wage growth  (Section 3), as well as a further adjustment by households to  the past weakness in real income growth.  Further ahead,  consumption growth is projected to rise gradually as wage  growth starts to pick up and the drag from sterling’s  depreciation on real income growth wanes (Section 5). 2.2	 Net trade and the current account Exports While sterling’s depreciation has weighed on household real  income growth, it will have supported margins for exporters.   Together with the boost provided by the recent strength in  global demand (Section 1), that is likely to support growth in  export volumes.  The outlook for export growth will also  depend on any changes to the United Kingdom’s trading  arrangements and how companies anticipate and respond to  these (Section 5). Between the end of 2015 and 2017 Q1, export prices fell by  5% in foreign currency terms, suggesting some increase in  competitiveness.  But they rose by 13% in sterling terms,  meaning that exporters’ margins are likely to have increased.   Consistent with that, survey measures of margins on exports  have picked up in recent months.  The Agents’ profit margin  company visit scores, for example, have generally been above  normal for export‑focused companies since late 2016, while  those for domestic‑focused companies have remained below  normal.  The rise in export margins is likely to support an  expansion in export volumes among firms with spare capacity.   As that capacity is eroded, and for firms with limited spare  capacity, those higher margins should provide an incentive to  invest (Section 2.3), thereby boosting export volumes over  time. + – 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 2013 14 15 16 17 Exports Percentage changes on a year earlier Imports Chart 2.6  UK import growth has outstripped export  growth recently Export and import volumes(a) (a)	 Chained‑volume measures, excluding the impact of MTIC fraud and unspecified goods.

Table 2.C  Monitoring the MPC’s key judgements  14	 Inflation Report  August 2017 How might households respond to the real  income squeeze? Household purchasing power has fallen in recent months as  sterling’s depreciation has pushed up the prices of imported  goods and services.  A key factor for the outlook for  GDP growth is the speed and extent to which households  adjust their spending in response.  This is likely to depend on a  number of factors including their holdings of savings and debt.   Households with larger savings might be able to reduce  spending by less in the short term, by running down those  savings or by saving less each month.  In contrast, those with  higher debt may need to reduce spending more quickly in  order to continue to meet their debt repayments, particularly  if those repayments are high relative to their incomes.  This  box examines evidence on how different households are likely  to respond to falls in their real incomes using the results of the  latest household survey carried out for the Bank by  NMG Consulting in May. Households were asked how they would adjust spending in  response to a 5% rise in the prices of all the goods and services  they consumed.(1)  Although not identical, this situation is  similar to the current squeeze in real incomes caused by  sterling’s depreciation.  The possible responses fell into three  main categories.  First, households could respond that they  would buy the same goods and services as they do currently,  even though they cost more.  That would mean maintaining  spending in real terms and increasing it in nominal terms.   Second, households could respond that they would spend  extra on some goods and services while cutting back on  others.  That would mean reducing spending in real terms but  by less than the fall in real income, such that nominal spending  still increased.  And third, households could respond that they  would spend no more than they do currently in nominal terms,  such that real spending falls by at least as much as the fall in  real income.  Around a third of respondents fell into each of  these three categories (Chart A). The survey results suggest that households who would reduce  real spending the most tended to have fewer savings and be  more concerned about their debt.  Chart A shows that around  half of those who reported that they would spend no more  than they do currently in nominal terms had less than £1,200  of savings.  In contrast, 60% of those who would maintain  their spending in real terms had over £15,000 of savings.   Those who reported that they would cut real spending also  tended to hold more debt, and to be more concerned about  that debt. Those households who would increase nominal spending in  response to the fall in their real income would need to pay for  that extra spending.  The majority of these households  reported that they would run down their savings, or save less  each month (Chart B).  In contrast, fewer than 10% would  borrow in order to finance the increase.  Consistent with the  fact that they tend to have fewer savings, a larger proportion  (1)	 The scenario was:  ‘We’d like you to imagine a scenario where the price of all goods  and services you buy increased for a sustained period.  Imagine the cost of everything  — food, clothes, travel costs, getting your hair cut, getting the car washed etc —  increased by 5% from tomorrow.  Please assume your income would not be any  higher unless you take action to increase it’.  Spend extra so as   to buy the same   goods and   services (31%) Spend extra on   some goods and   services (32%) Spend no more   than currently   (37%) Savings less than £1,200 Savings greater than £1,200 but less than £15,000 Savings greater than £15,000 0 20 40 60 80 100 Debt (concerned) Debt (not concerned) No debt Per cent of respondents within spending category Per cent of respondents within spending category 0 20 40 60 80 100 Decrease real spending by more Chart A  Households who would cut real spending  tended to have fewer savings and higher debt Results from the NMG Consulting survey(a) Sources:  NMG Consulting survey and Bank calculations.

(a)	 Households who reported that they would increase nominal spending in response to the  scenario in footnote (1), as in Chart A, are grouped by the ways in which they would finance  that spending.  Households were allowed to select up to three options.  	 Section 2  Demand and output	 15 of households who would partially cut real spending reported  that they would fund the extra nominal spending by working  more (Section 3). Over time, households will need to adjust their spending  towards the lower level of their real income.  The responses to  the NMG survey suggest that households in aggregate will  adjust spending only gradually.  In addition, the variation  between responses means that the overall impact will depend  in part on which types of households have experienced the  largest squeeze in their real incomes and how much of  aggregate spending those households account for.  The MPC  will continue to monitor both the aggregate response to the  real income squeeze, and how that response appears to be  varying across households. UK export volumes fell in Q1 (Table 2.A), but that largely  reflected a fallback in exports of non‑monetary gold following  a sharp rise in Q4.  This is a volatile component of net trade  which is offset by same‑sized movements in private sector  investment in valuables.(1)  Excluding the impact of  non‑monetary gold and other valuables, UK exports rose by  0.7% in Q1, and by 3% over the year to Q1 (Chart 2.6).  That  was lower than expected in May, reflecting weak growth in  services exports, although growth in goods exports was  relatively strong. Export volumes are projected to grow modestly in the near  term.  That growth is a little stronger than expected in May,  reflecting the further depreciation of sterling since then  (Section 1).  Consistent with that, survey measures of export  orders and deliveries have continued to rise (Chart 2.7). Imports and the current account Although sterling’s depreciation has raised the price of  imported goods and services (Section 4), growth in UK imports  has nevertheless outstripped growth in exports since 2016 H2  (Chart 2.6).  As a consequence, and excluding the impact of  non‑monetary gold and other valuables, net trade subtracted  0.4 percentage points from GDP in Q1. Import growth is projected to slow a little in coming quarters.   When combined with the expected growth in exports, this  means that net trade is projected to provide a small boost to  GDP growth over the remainder of 2017, broadly as expected  in May.  That offsets part of the near‑term weakness in  household spending growth (Section 2.1). The weakness in net trade meant that the current account  deficit — which reflects the balance of nominal trade flows  and other payments between the United Kingdom and the rest  of the world — widened to 3.4% of GDP in Q1 (Chart 2.8).   A small part of that widening was also due to an increase in  the deficit on primary income, the net value of investment  income received by UK residents.  The current account deficit  is expected to have remained at around that level in Q2. + – 25 20 15 10 5 0 5 10 15 20 2007 09 11 13 15 17 Range of survey indicators(a) Exports(b) Percentage changes on a year earlier Chart 2.7  Surveys continue to point to a pickup in  export growth UK exports and survey indicators of export growth Sources:  Bank of England, BCC, CBI, EEF, IHS Markit, ONS and Bank calculations.

Following a fall over 2016, business investment is estimated to  have risen by 0.6% in Q1 (Table 2.A), broadly as expected in  May.  Investment is projected to continue to grow at a solid  pace in the near term, albeit by a little less than projected in  May (Table 2.C).  That is broadly consistent with surveys of  investment intentions, some of which weakened a little in Q2  (Chart 2.9). In addition to the boost provided by the strength of global  demand, the rate of return on capital as measured by the ONS  remains high and spare capacity is limited.  Financing conditions  may also provide some support to investment in the near term.   Both the cost of corporate bond issuance (Section 1) and the  cost of bank loans for businesses have fallen since the start of  2016, although increases in market interest rates have raised the  cost of bond issuance more recently and are likely to exert some  upwards pressure on the cost of bank loans in coming quarters.   Overall net finance raised by companies picked up in Q2, having  been relatively weak in the previous two quarters (Chart 2.10). Set against the support for investment from global conditions  and financing costs, sterling’s depreciation is likely to raise the  cost of investment because, with the exception of buildings  (around one quarter of the total), investment is relatively  import‑intensive. In addition, the anticipation of Brexit and related uncertainties  are likely to dampen investment growth somewhat.  Two fifths  of respondents to a recent CBI survey on investment reported  that Brexit had negatively affected their investment decisions.   And the Bank’s Agents report that uncertainty surrounding the  United Kingdom’s future trading arrangements has meant that  some larger firms, and those more exposed to a potential  change in trading arrangements, have been delaying medium  and longer‑term investment plans.  Some firms have  considered relocating elements of activity to other countries,  or refocusing investment outside the United Kingdom, in order  to mitigate any adverse impacts. Taken as a whole, investment is projected to grow less strongly  than would have been expected given the strength in global and  financial conditions (Section 5).  Investment remains weak  relative to the size of the capital stock and so the capital stock is  projected to expand only slowly over the forecast period. 2.4	 Government spending The MPC’s forecasts are conditioned on the Government’s tax  and spending plans detailed in the Spring 2017 Budget.

Section 2  Demand and output	 17 Recent developments in the housing market UK housing market activity and house price inflation have  slowed over the past 18 months, and that slowdown has  gathered pace since the start of the year.  House prices were  broadly flat in Q2 (top panel of Chart A).  And mortgage  approvals fell to around 65,000 per month (middle panel of  Chart A), weaker than expected in May.  In contrast, new  house building has been robust, with housing starts having  increased by 26% in the year to 2017 Q1 (bottom panel of  Chart A).  This box explores some of the possible drivers of  these developments, together with their implications for the  near‑term outlook. Explaining the recent weakness in the housing market Much of the weakness in housing market activity over the past  18 months reflects a fall in the number of buy‑to‑let property  transactions following policy changes such as the introduction  of the stamp duty charge for additional properties in  April 2016.  Buy‑to‑let mortgage completions fell sharply in  April 2016 (middle panel of Chart A) and have remained  broadly flat since then.  Perhaps consistent with that, the  slowdown in housing market activity over the past 18 months  has been particularly pronounced in London and the  South East, which together account for around 50% of  buy‑to‑let transactions.  Activity may also have been affected  by uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum. The most recent falls in house prices and activity do not  appear to have been driven by weakness in the buy‑to‑let  market, however.  The latest fall in mortgage approvals has  largely reflected falls in the number of homemovers and  first‑time buyers.  And the slowdown appears to have been a  little more broad‑based across regions, with contacts of the  Bank’s Agents reporting that housing demand has softened in  many parts of the United Kingdom in recent months. That more widespread slowdown is likely to have been driven  by some of the same factors driving the weakness in spending,  in particular the weakness in income growth (Section 2.1).   Since households tend to have some flexibility in moving  house, they may choose to delay moving or to reduce the  amount they are willing to spend following a period of weak  income growth, especially if they are uncertain about their  likely income levels in the longer term.  That may particularly  constrain activity in areas such as London and the South East,  where house prices are higher relative to incomes.(1) In contrast to the weakness in house price inflation and  housing activity, housing investment grew by 1.8% in Q1,  stronger than expected in May.  Around a quarter of housing  investment is comprised of spending on services associated  with property transactions, while the remainder is formed of  (1)	 For more details on the level of house prices relative to incomes, see the box on  page 12 of the June 2017 Financial Stability Report;  www.bankofengland.co.uk/ publications/Pages/fsr/2017/jun.aspx. 0 40 80 120 160 200 240 2004 08 12 16 Thousands per quarter (annualised) UK private housing starts(b) 2004 08 12 16 2004 08 12 16   0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 Thousands per month Mortgage approvals   for house purchase Homemover completions First-time buyer   completions Buy-to-let   completions + – 30 20 10 0 10 20 30 Quarter-on-quarter annualised percentage change UK house prices(a) Chart A  House prices and activity have slowed but new  building has continued to increase House prices, mortgage approvals for house purchase, mortgage  completions and housing starts Sources:  Bank of England, Council of Mortgage Lenders, Department for Communities and  Local Government, IHS Markit, Nationwide and Bank calculations.

Growth in new housing starts has been robust, which will  support measured housing investment over time as those  homes are built.  Contacts of the Bank’s Agents report that the  strength in starts has partly reflected strong demand for  new‑build properties from first‑time buyers using the Help to  Buy equity loan scheme, which offers government‑funded  equity loans of up to 20% of the purchase price of a  new‑build property. Outlook for the housing market and impact on the  wider economy Continued weak income growth in the near term is likely to  mean that price inflation and activity in the housing market  remain subdued over coming quarters.  Set against that,  however, mortgage interest rates remain around record lows  (Table 2.B) and should continue to support housing demand,  although recent increases in market interest rates (Section 1)  are likely to push up mortgage rates a little in the near term.   Recent action by the Financial Policy Committee, by  promoting consistency across lenders in the tests they use to  assess mortgage affordability, should insure against the risk of  a loosening in underwriting standards.(1) Annualised house price inflation is projected to pick up only  gradually, and mortgage approvals are projected to remain  broadly flat in the near term.  That is weaker than expected in  May, in line with the net balances of responses to the  RICS survey, which point to smaller rises in house prices and  sales over the next twelve months than earlier in the year. Housing market developments tend to be closely linked to  consumption growth, in large part because both tend to be  driven by common factors such as household confidence and  income expectations.  To the extent that the near‑term  weakness in the housing market is being driven by weak  income growth, that is likely to be consistent with subdued  growth in household spending (Section 2.1).  The weakness in  the housing market may also reduce spending growth directly,  by lowering the value of homeowners’ equity against which  they can borrow, although this effect is estimated to be  small.(2) While weaker housing market activity will weigh on the pace  of housing investment growth, the recent strength in housing  starts is likely to support it in the near term.  Housing  investment growth is projected to be relatively strong in the  second half of 2017, before falling back further ahead.

Section 3  Supply and the labour market	 19 3	 Supply and the labour market Growth in companies’ demand for labour appears to have remained resilient in recent months, with  quarterly employment growth picking up in 2017 H1.  Despite a further fall in unemployment, wage  growth remains subdued, probably in part due to continued weak productivity growth.  Wage  growth is projected to remain modest in the near term, before recovering somewhat further ahead  reflecting underlying tightness in the labour market. Output growth has slowed since last year (Section 2), but  labour demand growth has remained relatively resilient.   Annual growth in total hours worked is only slightly lower  than a year ago (Chart 3.1), with a rise in average hours  worked partially offsetting a decline in annual employment  growth.  That resilience has been associated with a continued  tightening in labour market conditions (Section 3.1). A key indicator of tightness in the labour market is the  unemployment rate.  The unemployment rate fell to 4.5% in  the three months to May, and is expected to have fallen  slightly further to 4.4% in the three months to June  (Chart 3.2).  That was lower than expected at the time of the  May Report and is broadly in line with the MPC’s estimate of  the equilibrium rate of unemployment, as set out in the box  on pages 18–20 of the February Report. Changes in the degree of tightness in the labour market are  usually reflected in wage growth as they influence how much  companies need to pay to hold on to their employees or hire  new ones.  Wage growth slowed, for example, as  unemployment increased during the financial crisis  (Chart 3.3).  But wage growth has not picked up to past rates  as unemployment has declined, and has actually fallen back  since the end of 2016.  Regular pay growth, which excludes  bonuses, is expected to have been only 2.2% in 2017 Q2  (Chart 3.4), although that was a little higher than expected in  May.(1) As has been the case for several years, much of the continued  weakness in wage growth is likely to reflect subdued  productivity growth (Section 3.2).  Over time, the pace of  wage growth is determined largely by productivity growth and  the price of domestic output, as that determines the revenue  available to companies to pay wages.  While wage growth can  be volatile, it is also possible that other factors, such as  (1)	 Recent improvements to the methodology used by the ONS to estimate the pay of  employees of small businesses mean that estimates for the level of AWE since 2000  have been revised.

The outlook for wages will depend, in part, on  the role of these factors and how persistent they prove to be.   Regular pay growth is projected to remain around its current  rate over the rest of this year, before picking up further ahead  as these factors wane and underlying tightness in the labour  market pushes up wage demands (Section 5). 3.1	 Labour market developments Employment and unemployment Quarterly employment growth picked up sharply in 2017 Q1  and, while it is expected to have slowed in Q2 (Table 3.A), it  appears to be stronger than anticipated at the time of the  May Report.  The pickup over 2017 so far has been more than  accounted for by an increase in the number of employees,  with the number of self-employed having fallen slightly.   While the data can be volatile, it is possible that companies  reduced hiring following the EU referendum, in anticipation of  a fall in demand, and subsequently began to make up the  shortfall in staff numbers in Q1 as demand proved somewhat  more resilient than expected.  Nevertheless, over the past year  as a whole, employment growth has slowed from its more  rapid rates in previous years (Chart 3.1). Indicators point to fairly solid employment growth in Q3.  For  example, the number of vacancies relative to the size of the  labour force remained above its pre-crisis average in Q2, while  the rate of redundancies remained low (Table 3.B).  Most  survey indicators of companies’ employment intentions are  also above their historical averages (Chart 3.5).  Further  ahead, employment growth is expected to slow somewhat, as  output growth remains subdued. Alongside the pickup in employment growth, the  unemployment rate continued to fall in the three months to  May, to 4.5%, and is expected to have fallen a little further  more recently (Chart 3.2).  The fall to May was mainly driven  by a further decline in the short-term unemployment rate,  with long-term unemployment broadly unchanged at around  its past average rate (Table 3.B).  Overall, the unemployment  rate is currently judged to be broadly in line with its  equilibrium rate.  As set out in the February Report, however,  there remains significant uncertainty around that equilibrium  rate and there are a range of views among MPC members. The further fall in unemployment is consistent with signs that  the labour market has tightened.  Most survey indicators  suggest that recruitment difficulties increased during 2017 H1  and are above pre-crisis averages (Table 3.B).  And contacts of  the Bank’s Agents report that the increase in recruitment  difficulties has been broad-based across a range of sectors.   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 4 5 6 7 8 9 Unemployment rate, per cent  Regular pay growth, per cent(a) 2001–07 2008–09 2010–12 2013 2014 2015–17 Q2(b) Chart 3.3  Wage growth has remained subdued as the  unemployment rate has fallen Wage Phillips curve:  wage growth and unemployment (a)	 Whole-economy average weekly earnings (AWE) total pay excluding bonuses and arrears of  pay.

Section 3  Supply and the labour market	 21 The unemployment rate is expected to remain broadly stable  in coming months as employment growth moderates. Hours worked In addition to employment, labour demand growth can also be  met by increases in the number of hours people work.  Average  hours worked are expected to have been broadly stable in  2017 Q2, somewhat higher than a year ago (Chart 3.6).  The extent to which changes in average hours worked affect  pay pressures will depend in part on how many hours those  staff want to work.  According to the Labour Force Survey  (LFS), the net number of additional desired hours remains  higher than prior to the financial crisis (Table 3.B).  And the  proportion of those working part-time who would prefer a  full-time job is still some way above its pre-crisis level, despite  falling in recent months as the proportion of the workforce in  full-time jobs has increased (Chart 3.7).  That could suggest  that some scope remains for average hours to rise further  before pay pressures return to normal.  In practice, however,  evidence suggests that people tend to be satisfied by smaller  increases in hours than they previously reported wanting.(1) The loss in real income as a result of the depreciation in  sterling (Section 2) may also lead to some people wanting to  work longer hours to make up that loss.  As discussed in the  box on pages 14–15, around 10% of respondents to the latest  household survey carried out for the Bank by NMG Consulting  in May reported that they would try to maintain their  spending to some degree in the face of a fall in their real  incomes by seeking more work.  Perhaps consistent with that,  average hours worked have picked up in recent quarters,  relative to the number of hours people report they usually  work (Chart 3.6), as the amount of leave taken has fallen. Despite the possibility of some households wanting to work  longer hours in response to the slowing in real income growth,  average hours worked are projected to fall back gradually in  coming quarters.  That reflects the long-term structural effect  of an ageing workforce as older workers typically want to work  fewer hours.(2) Participation and population growth Changes in the proportion of the population participating in  the labour market — either working or looking for  employment — will also affect labour supply and therefore  labour market conditions.  The participation rate is expected  to have fallen slightly in 2017 Q2 (Chart 3.8).  Participation is  projected to remain broadly stable in the near term, reflecting  two large but broadly offsetting factors.  The rising average  age of the population will tend to depress the aggregate  (1)	 For more details, see Weale, M (2014), ‘Slack and the labour market’;  www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2014/speech716.pdf.

Offsetting this, the participation rate  among older people has increased steadily in recent years and  is expected to continue to rise.  In addition, in the near term, it  is also possible that weak real income growth could push up  participation if some of those not currently looking for a job  seek to supplement their household income by entering the  labour market. Beyond changes in the participation rate, labour supply will be  determined in the long run mainly by population growth.  In  the MPC’s projections, population growth is assumed to  evolve in line with the ONS’s latest projection, made in  October 2015.  Under that projection, population growth  slows over the next three years, mainly as a result of lower net  immigration. In 2016, net inward migration was around 248,000, or 0.4%  of the population.  That is the lowest figure since the four  quarters to 2014 Q1, although it remains a little above the  ONS’s 2015 projection.  Much of the fall, relative to a year  earlier, reflected a reduced net inflow from the rest of the  European Union.  Some respondents to a survey by the Bank’s  Agents in May reported reduced availability of non-UK EU  labour over the past twelve months.  That availability was  expected to contract further in the coming year. Although changes in net inward migration will lead to changes  in labour supply, they will also affect domestic demand.  In the  past, shifts in the path for net migration do not appear to have  had a significant direct impact on slack or wage growth.(1)   The prospects for net migration remain particularly uncertain  and will depend on a number of factors, including the  United Kingdom’s relative economic performance, the sterling  exchange rate and government policy. 3.2	 Productivity Four-quarter hourly productivity growth is expected to have  slowed slightly further in 2017 Q2 to 0.4% (Chart 3.9), and is  projected to remain broadly stable over the rest of the year.   Further ahead, productivity growth is projected to pick up  (Section 5).  In particular, some of the recent weakness in  productivity growth is likely in part to reflect a degree of spare  capacity within firms, as output growth has slowed alongside  resilient employment growth.  As that spare capacity is  absorbed, that is likely to push up productivity growth for a  period. Overall, however, productivity growth is likely to remain  subdued.  The low level of business investment (Section 2)  continues to lead to relatively slow growth in the capital stock  — the resources and equipment available to workers to  produce output — which will weigh on productivity growth.

Section 3  Supply and the labour market	 23 The outlook for productivity will also be sensitive to how  companies anticipate and respond to the post-Brexit trading  arrangements between the United Kingdom and its economic  partners.  The box on page 29 of the August 2016 Report set  out some of the long-term effects of changes in trading  arrangements on productivity growth.  It remains difficult to  know the nature, scale and speed of companies’ adjustment,  both in anticipation of changes in future trading arrangements  and given the uncertainty around those arrangements.  Those  uncertainties are likely to lead to lower investment in capital  equipment, research and skills than would otherwise be the  case, and so could weigh on overall productivity growth, for a  period at least (Section 5). 3.3	 The outlook for wage growth In the private sector, wage growth in the medium term will be  determined to a large extent by the revenue available to  companies to pay wages.  This, in turn, will be determined by  productivity growth and the prices companies can achieve for  their output.  Much of the weakness in wage growth in recent  years appears to reflect the persistent weakness in  productivity growth (Section 3.2).  Cumulative growth of real  product wages — which adjusts wage growth for changes in  the prices of companies’ output — has been broadly in line  with that in productivity per head since the start of the crisis  (Chart 3.10). Despite weak productivity growth, wage growth picked up  during 2014–16 as the labour market tightened and  unemployment fell (Chart 3.3).  That was associated with a  recovery in the labour share of income (Chart 3.11).  But wage  growth and the labour share have both fallen back somewhat  over the past year, even as unemployment has continued to  fall. While wage growth can be volatile, the recent renewed  weakness suggests that factors other than productivity and  tightness in the labour market may be influencing pay  decisions.  Uncertainty around the economic outlook may be  one such factor.  It is possible that some households’ concerns  about the economic outlook in coming quarters have left  them reluctant to push for faster pay growth, even as  unemployment has fallen and inflation has risen.  For example,  household wage expectations, according to the Bank of  England/TNS quarterly survey, were broadly unchanged in  2017 Q1, relative to a year ago, despite a pickup in inflation  expectations (Section 4).  Uncertainty about the economic  outlook may also affect companies’ willingness to raise pay at  a faster pace until they have more clarity about future  demand.  The Bank’s Agents report that, for some companies,  such uncertainty has been one factor influencing their pay  decisions. 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 2002 04 06 08 10 12 14 16 Percentage change on a year earlier + – Chart 3.9  Productivity growth appears to have slowed in  2017 H1 Hourly labour productivity(a) (a)	 GDP is based on the backcast for the final estimate of GDP.

Consistent  with that, most survey indicators of pay growth remain below  past averages (Table 3.D).  Further out, pay growth is  projected to pick up, as any temporary factors currently  weighing on wage growth dissipate, and the past tightening in  the labour market starts to push up wage demands more  widely.  Overall, wage growth is likely to remain below its  pre-crisis average rate, however, largely reflecting continued  subdued productivity growth (Section 5).

Section 4  Costs and prices	 25 4	 Costs and prices Although CPI inflation has been volatile, it has risen over 2017 and was 2.6% in June.  It is expected  to remain around 2¾% in the near term, boosted by higher import prices as a result of the  depreciation in sterling, before easing back towards the 2% target during 2018.  Growth in firms’  imported costs appears to have started moderating.  Domestically generated inflation appears to  have remained relatively subdued and inflation expectations remain consistent with the MPC’s  2% target. 4.1	 Consumer price developments and the  near-term outlook CPI inflation was 2.6% in June, having picked up from 2.3% in  March.  This outturn was in line with the projection at the time  of the May Report (Chart 4.1), although inflation has been  volatile in recent months.  In particular, shifts in the timing of  discounting have led to swings in clothing and footwear price  inflation. Sterling depreciated sharply following the EU referendum and  has remained 15%–20% lower than its November 2015 peak  since then.  As a result, firms’ imported costs have risen  sharply since mid-2016 (Chart 4.2) leading to upward pressure  on many retail prices (Section 4.2).  The speed at which firms  pass movements in sterling through to consumer prices varies  across products.  Fuel prices responded to the depreciation  quite quickly and over recent months the effect of higher  import prices has become more widespread across CPI  components (Chart 4.3).  Reflecting this, margins on  consumer goods and services are estimated to have recovered  somewhat, having been squeezed by rising imported costs in  2016 H2 (Chart 4.4). As well as firms’ external costs, the path for inflation will  depend on developments in domestically generated inflation  (DGI) (Section 4.3).  DGI will reflect developments in domestic  labour costs (Chart 4.2), as well as firms’ margins.  These can  be influenced by companies’ and households’ inflation  expectations. CPI inflation is projected to remain around 2¾% in coming  months (Chart 4.1).  The boost from the 2016 pickup in fuel  prices has started to drop out of the annual comparison, which  will drag on inflation, while higher import prices continue to  push it up.  Inflation is expected to start to fall back towards  the 2% target during 2018, primarily reflecting past increases  in energy prices falling out of the annual comparison.

Those import prices will reflect both  the foreign currency export prices charged by firms selling to  the United Kingdom and the sterling exchange rate.  The  depreciation in sterling has pushed up import prices since late  2015.  The impact on CPI inflation will depend on the timing of  and extent to which companies:  absorb those higher import  costs in their margins;  can limit growth in other costs such as  wages;  or choose to raise their prices. Energy prices  As oil is highly tradable its price is set in global markets.  The  cost of oil makes up around a third of the cost of retail fuel  and changes in oil prices tend to be passed through to  consumer prices much more quickly than changes in other  import prices.  In sterling terms, oil prices have fallen by 10%  since the May Report (Chart 4.5) mainly reflecting a fall in  US dollar oil prices (Section 1).  Despite this, sterling oil prices  remain slightly higher than a year ago.  Fuel prices are  therefore expected to continue to make a small positive  contribution to inflation in the near term (Chart 4.3), though  less than projected in May.  The oil futures curve, on which the  MPC’s forecasts are conditioned, slopes slightly upwards,  which implies a gradual rise in petrol prices over the next  few years. Sterling wholesale gas prices have also fallen but broadly in  line with the futures curve on which the MPC’s May forecasts  were conditioned (Chart 4.5), and the futures curve has  changed little since then.  The major retail energy providers  have announced increases in their electricity and gas prices in  recent months, reflecting rising costs associated with  structural changes, such as the increased use of renewable  energy sources.  Electricity and gas prices have pushed up  inflation since March and their contribution is expected to  increase slightly further in Q3 (Chart 4.3). Non-energy import prices Sterling has depreciated by 18% since its November 2015  peak, including by 2% since the May Report (Section 1).  That  depreciation will push up a range of consumer prices over  time.  As explained in the box on pages 28–29 of the  November 2015 Report, Bank staff have estimated that, on  average, 60% of changes in the sterling value of world export  prices tend to be reflected in UK import prices.  That  pass‑through is usually completed within a year.  Those  changes in import prices are judged to affect CPI inflation over  a longer period, broadly in line with the import share of CPI,  which is around a third. While import price data can be subject to large revisions, they  currently suggest that the pass-through of the recent  depreciation to import prices has, to date, been more limited  2 0 2 4 6 2011 12 13 14 15 16 17 Fuels and lubricants (3%) Electricity and gas (3%) Food and non-alcoholic   beverages (10%) Other goods(b) (36%) Services (48%) CPI inﬂation (per cent) Percentage points Projection(c)   + – Chart 4.3  Rising goods prices have pushed up inflation  Contributions to CPI inflation(a) Sources:  Bloomberg, Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, ONS and  Bank calculations.

Section 4  Costs and prices	 27 than on average in the past.  Sterling non‑energy import prices  rose by 8% between 2015 Q4 and 2017 Q1 (Chart 4.6).  This  represents only around 40%, rather than 60%, of the change  in sterling world export prices over that period. Despite that more limited rise in import prices, CPI inflation  appears to have picked up by around its average response to  the depreciation in sterling.  Inflation among import-intensive  components of CPI — those components that are imported or  have a high share of imported inputs, such as food — has  picked up sharply and remains relatively elevated (Chart 4.7).  The pickup in CPI inflation could suggest that import prices  have actually risen by more than suggested by the official  data.  The rise in import prices has, however, been in line with  a range of indicators of imported input costs and those  measures eased back in 2017 Q2 (Chart 4.6). It is possible that the speed of pass-through to CPI inflation  from import prices has been faster or that pass‑through, in  particular to domestically produced tradable goods and  services prices, has been greater than on average.  This would  suggest that although imported input costs have squeezed  domestic firms’ margins, these have recovered more quickly  than in the past.  While exporters’ margins will have been  boosted by the depreciation in sterling, Bank staff estimate  that margins on consumer goods and services were squeezed  somewhat in 2016 H2 (Chart 4.4).  The current import price  data suggest margins recovered slightly in 2017 Q1, and  probably recovered further in Q2.  A range of indicators suggest that companies’ output price  inflation is likely to moderate somewhat in coming months  (Chart 4.7).  That is likely to reduce the extent of inflationary  pressure along supply chains but will take time to be passed  through to retail prices.  As such, while CPI inflation is  expected to start to ease back towards the 2% target during  2018, the pass-through of past imported cost pressures is  expected to continue to boost inflation for some time  (Section 5). 4.3	 Underlying inflationary pressure  Domestically generated inflation Alongside external costs, the rate of CPI inflation reflects  domestically generated inflation (DGI).  DGI, which reflects  developments in domestic costs as well as domestic profit  margins, will determine where CPI inflation settles once  transitory effects, such as from the recent fall in sterling, have  passed through.  As discussed in the box on page 28 of the  May Report, while it is not directly observable, there are a  number of measures that are closely linked to the concept  of DGI.  0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 2007 09 11 13 15 17 19 May 2017 Inﬂation Report futures curve(c) August 2017 Inﬂation Report futures curve(c) £ per barrel   Pence per therm     Oil(a) (right-hand scale)    Gas(b) (left-hand scale)       Chart 4.5  Oil and gas prices have fallen  Sterling oil and wholesale gas prices Sources:  Bank of England, Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters Datastream and Bank calculations.

Core inflation, however, can still be  significantly affected by external cost pressures, as many  goods and some services prices are sensitive to changes in  import prices.  Indeed, measures of core inflation have picked  up since mid-2016, as the effect of the depreciation in sterling  has been reflected across a range of goods prices.  Even if  particularly import-intensive CPI components are excluded, it  is difficult to remove the impact of external cost pressures  entirely. Measures of inflation in the services sector are often also used  as indicators of DGI, as most services are produced  domestically.  Two key measures used are wholesale services  prices — as measured by the services producer price index  (PPI) — and the price of consumer services excluding  components that are more likely to be related to tradable  prices or government policy, such as airfares and education.   These measures of services price inflation have been relatively  stable (Chart 4.8).  However, while services prices are  informative about trends in DGI, they exclude the  domestically produced element of goods.  More broadly, as  with core CPI, services prices will also be affected by external  cost pressures to some degree;  for example, many service  providers will use imported goods as an input.  And PPI will  also include the prices of services provided to exporters and  importers. At face value, measures of the price of domestic production  appear to capture the concept of DGI most closely.  The GVA  deflator is a measure of the price of domestic production, from  which the government sector can be excluded to capture the  price of private domestic production better.  However, these  deflator-based measures are also affected by import and  export prices.  Over the past year, rises in export prices relative  to import prices have pushed up the GVA deflator.  These  deflator-based measures are, therefore, likely to overstate the  extent of domestic inflationary pressure at present. As the main domestic input into production, the cost of labour  is a key determinant of DGI.  The degree to which growth in  labour costs per worker, such as wages and non-wage benefits,  affect inflation will depend on how these costs evolve relative  to growth in the output produced per worker — known as unit  labour cost (ULC) growth.  While ULC growth is less likely than  other DGI indicators to be affected by external factors, it does  not capture changes in firms’ margins.  Moreover, ULC growth  can be quite volatile. Four-quarter ULC growth remained below its historical  average rate at around 2% in 2017 Q1, as the weakness in  wage growth coincided with modest productivity growth  (Chart 4.9).  And four-quarter ULC growth is expected to have  slowed sharply in Q2, reflecting a marked slowing in non-wage  4 0 4 8 2001 04 07 10 13 16 Services PPI Services CPI Unit labour costs Unit wage costs Percentage changes on a year earlier + – 2 0 2 4 6 2001 04 07 10 13 16 + – GVA deﬂator   excluding government GVA   deﬂator Percentage changes on a year earlier Chart 4.8  Measures of DGI have on balance been  broadly stable Measures of domestically generated inflation(a) Sources:  ONS and Bank calculations.

Non-wage labour costs had been boosted  in April 2016 by a rise in employers’ National Insurance  contributions and these will have dropped out of the annual  comparison in 2017 Q2.  ULC growth is expected to pick back  up as wage growth starts to rise (Section 3) and as employers’  auto-enrolment pension contribution rates increase in  2018 Q2, raising non-wage labour costs.  In addition to labour costs, developments in firms’ margins are  a key determinant of DGI.  On the one hand, evidence of a  recent recovery in margins on consumer goods and services  (Section 4.2 and Chart 4.4) could suggest that domestic  inflationary pressure is increasing, as firms feel able to raise  their prices.  Moreover, margins tend to be cyclical, falling  when spare capacity opens up and then rising as capacity  pressures build, and so are likely to rise further (Section 5).(1)   On the other hand, if the increase in margins has occurred in  anticipation of further rises in import prices, then margins  could fall back as that growth in imported costs comes  through. Overall, indicators of DGI suggest that domestic inflationary  pressure is likely to have remained somewhat subdued in  recent quarters (Chart 4.8).  The rises in deflator-based  measures of DGI have largely reflected the rise in export prices  in response to the depreciation in sterling, rather than a  marked strengthening in domestic prices.  And while the  slowing in ULC growth is expected to be temporary, it is  expected to remain below rates consistent with inflation at  target in the near term, before recovering further ahead  (Section 5).  There are, however, a range of views among  MPC members about the relative importance of various  measures of DGI. Inflation expectations Inflation expectations can also affect the outlook for inflation,  such as through wage and price-setting behaviour.  The MPC  monitors a range of indicators to assess whether inflation  expectations remain consistent with its 2% target. Movements in measures of companies’ inflation expectations  have been mixed since May.  Expectations for CPI inflation in  two years’ time among respondents to the Deloitte CFO  Survey rose slightly further in Q2 (Chart 4.10), with the  median expectation rising from 2.4% in Q1 to 2.6%.  In  contrast, the CBI measure of respondents’ expected inflation  within their own sector fell back somewhat in Q2, following a  sharp rise in Q1 (Table 4.B). Most other indicators of inflation expectations have changed  little since May (Table 4.B).  Short-term and long-term  household inflation expectations have, on average, remained  (1)	 For more details, see Macallan, C and Parker, M (2008), ‘How do mark-ups vary with  demand?’, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Vol. 48, No. 2, pages 167–73;   www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/quarterlybulletin/qb080203.pdf. 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 2005 07 09 11 13 15 17 Productivity Non-wage labour costs per head Wages, salaries and self-employment   income per head(b) Unit labour cost growth (per cent) Percentage points   + – Chart 4.9  Unit labour cost growth is expected to have  slowed temporarily in Q2 Decomposition of four-quarter whole-economy unit labour cost  growth(a) Sources:  ONS and Bank calculations.

Similarly, financial  market measures of inflation compensation suggest market  participants’ expectations have changed little since May at  both short and long-term horizons, and long-run expectations  remain close to past averages. Overall, the MPC judges that inflation expectations remain  well anchored, and that indicators of medium-term inflation  expectations continue to be broadly consistent with the 2%  target.

Section 5  Prospects for inflation	 31 5	 Prospects for inflation CPI inflation has remained above the 2% target as rises in import prices following the steep fall in  the sterling exchange rate last year continue to pass through to consumer prices.  That has weighed  on households’ real incomes and consumption, contributing to the slowdown in GDP growth in  the first half of 2017.  Over the forecast period, growth in real income and consumption is projected  to remain subdued.  The effect of that on overall GDP growth is offset to some extent by  UK exports and investment, which are supported by strong growth in the rest of the world and  the lower exchange rate.  Overall, given a market-implied path for Bank Rate that rises by around  ½ percentage point over the next three years, growth is projected to be modest and unemployment  to stay close to its current rate.  Import price pressures begin to fade in the second half of the  forecast period, but are still keeping inflation above the 2% target at the end.  On the market path  for Bank Rate, the small degree of slack remaining in the economy is absorbed and domestic  inflationary pressures are judged likely to increase over the forecast period.       CPI inflation was 2.6% in June, as projected three months  ago, as higher import prices continued to feed through the  supply chain.  Wage growth has remained subdued.   Following the strong outturns immediately after the  EU referendum, UK GDP growth fell back in the first half of  2017.  Growth is expected to remain at 0.3% in Q3 before  picking up slightly at the end of the year.  Over 2017 as a  whole, growth is projected to be a little weaker than  anticipated in May, reflecting a less marked pickup in business  investment (Section 2).   In contrast, global growth has remained strong.  In particular,  euro-area activity indicators point to faster growth in the near  term than projected in May.  That strength has been reflected  in financial asset prices.  The euro has risen against both  sterling and the US dollar over the past three months.   Longer-term interest rates have risen in many advanced  economies, as have implied paths for policy rates over shorter  horizons.  In the United Kingdom, financial market prices now imply a  rise in Bank Rate in 2018 Q3, compared with 2019 Q4 at the  time of the May Report.  The projections in this Report are  conditioned on a path for Bank Rate nearly ¼ percentage  point higher than that in the May Report (Table 5.A).  The  interest rates faced by households and companies also depend  on the spreads banks charge over market interest rates.  Since  May, these spreads have fallen slightly but the effect of that is  projected to be offset over the forecast period by the impact  Table 5.A  Conditioning path for Bank Rate implied by forward  market interest rates(a) Per cent	 	 2017	 2018	 2019	 2020  	 Q3(b)	 Q4	 Q1	 Q2	 Q3	 Q4	 Q1	 Q2	 Q3	 Q4	 Q1	 Q2	 Q3 August	 0.2	 0.3	 0.4	 0.4	 0.5	 0.5	 0.5	 0.6	 0.6	 0.7	 0.7	 0.7	 0.8 May	 0.2	 0.2	 0.3	 0.3	 0.3	 0.3	 0.4	 0.4	 0.4	 0.5 	 0.5	 0.5  (a)	 The data are fifteen working day averages of one-day forward rates to 26 July 2017 and 3 May 2017  respectively.

The decline in sterling  since late 2015 largely reflects financial market  participants’ judgements about the impact of Brexit on the  United Kingdom.  Those judgements depend on assumptions  about the United Kingdom’s trading relationships after Brexit  and about the transition to those arrangements.  As in  previous Reports, the MPC’s projections are conditioned on  the average of a range of possible outcomes for the  United Kingdom’s trading relationship with the European  Union.  They also assume that households and companies  base their decisions on the expectation of a smooth  adjustment to those new trading arrangements.        The projections in this Report are very similar to those made  three months ago (Table 5.B).  Inflation begins the projection  well above the 2% target.  It is expected to remain around  2¾% until early next year (Chart 5.1), with some monthly  volatility around that path, such that it is projected to peak at  around 3% in October.  That overshoot reflects upward  pressure from the prices of tradable goods and services, which  begins to ease in the second half of the forecast period  (Key Judgement 1).  Domestic inflationary pressures, and in  particular wage growth, have largely remained subdued even  as unemployment has fallen towards the MPC’s central  (1)	 Unless otherwise stated, the projections shown in this section are conditioned on:   Bank Rate following a path implied by market yields;  the stock of purchased gilts  remaining at £435 billion and the stock of purchased corporate bonds remaining at  £10 billion throughout the forecast period and the Term Funding Scheme (TFS), all  three of which are financed by the issuance of central bank reserves;  the  Recommendations and Directions of the Financial Policy Committee and the current  regulatory plans of the Prudential Regulation Authority;  the Government’s tax and  spending plans as set out in the 2017 March Budget;  commodity prices following  market paths;  and the sterling exchange rate remaining broadly flat.

They have been conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.B footnote (b).  If economic circumstances identical to today’s  were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that inflation in any particular quarter would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of those occasions.  The fan charts are constructed  so that outturns of inflation are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter red areas on 30 occasions.  In any particular quarter of the forecast period, inflation is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the  fans on 90 out of 100 occasions.  And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions inflation can fall anywhere outside the red area of the fan chart.  Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey  background.

Although labour market slack  has diminished, there is judged to be some spare capacity  within companies, although estimates of this are uncertain.   Over the forecast period, slack in the economy is absorbed  gradually and wage and domestic price pressures increase.   Those increasing pressures mean that CPI inflation stabilises  towards the end of the forecast period, even as imported  pressures are falling away (Key Judgement 2).  Conditioned on  market yields, inflation is projected to be a little above the  target at the end of the forecast period, although the  overshoot can entirely be accounted for by the impact of  higher import prices.  The effects on inflation of the slightly  higher path for Bank Rate than in May are offset by greater  upward pressure from the lower exchange rate, so the inflation  profile is very similar to that three months ago (Chart 5.2).   The projections for wages and import prices imply continued  weakness in households’ real income growth over the forecast  period.  Consumption growth is therefore projected to remain  subdued, weighing on GDP growth (Key Judgement 3).  Acting  against that to some extent, global growth remains strong and  the lower exchange rate supports net trade.  That helps to  support UK investment by firms in the tradable sector over the  forecast period, partly offsetting continued uncertainty around  the effects of Brexit (Key Judgement 4).  The growth  projection therefore embodies a rotation towards net trade  and investment and away from consumption.  Overall,  UK activity picks up from current rates to grow at a modest  pace throughout the forecast period (Chart 5.3).  Growth is  slightly weaker than projected in May in the near term but  similar further out.   At its meeting ending on 2 August 2017, the MPC voted to  maintain Bank Rate at 0.25%, to maintain the stock of sterling  non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases,  financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £10 billion, to maintain the stock of UK government bond  purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves,  at £435 billion and to close the drawdown period for the Term  Funding Scheme on 28 February 2018, as envisaged when the  scheme was introduced.  The factors behind that decision are  set out in the Monetary Policy Summary on pages i–ii of this  Report, and in more detail in the Minutes of the meeting.(1)   The remainder of this section sets out the MPC’s projections,  and the risks around them, in more detail. 5.1	 The MPC’s key judgements and risks Key Judgement 1:  significant upward pressure on inflation  from import prices eases only in the second half of the  forecast period The decline in the sterling exchange rate following the vote to  leave the European Union continues to shape the MPC’s  (1)	 The Minutes are available at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/minutes/ Documents/mpc/pdf/2017/aug.pdf. 2013 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 + – 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Projection Bank estimates of past growth Percentage increases in output on a year earlier ONS data Chart 5.3  GDP projection based on market interest rate  expectations, other policy measures as announced The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for GDP growth.  It has been  conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.B footnote (b).  To the left of the vertical dashed line,  the distribution reflects the likelihood of revisions to the data over the past;  to the right, it  reflects uncertainty over the evolution of GDP growth in the future.  If economic circumstances  identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that  the mature estimate of GDP growth would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of  those occasions.  The fan chart is constructed so that outturns are also expected to lie within  each pair of the lighter green areas on 30 occasions.  In any particular quarter of the forecast  period, GDP growth is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fan on 90 out of  100 occasions.  And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions GDP growth can fall anywhere  outside the green area of the fan chart.  Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the  light grey background.  See the box on page 39 of the November 2007 Inflation Report for a  fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.  34	 Inflation Report  August 2017 inflation projection.  The sterling ERI has fallen a further 2%  since the May Report, to 18% below its late-2015 peak.  That is  feeding through to non-energy import prices, which have risen  by around 8% over the past year or so (Section 4).  That rise is  smaller than initially expected, suggesting a degree of  catch-up to come.  Combined with the depreciation since May,  that results in a projected further rise of 4% in aggregate  import prices (Chart 5.4).   With higher import prices feeding through to consumer prices  only gradually, consumer-facing companies’ profit margins  were squeezed by higher costs during 2016 (Section 4).  Some  of that squeeze has unwound in recent quarters as companies  have begun to raise prices in response.  Those price rises mean  that the contribution of import prices to inflation is estimated  to have picked up to around ¾ percentage point.  That  contribution is expected to rise slightly further in coming  quarters, before beginning to fall back.  This is consistent with  the MPC’s assumption that import prices will pass through to  CPI inflation slightly faster than in previous episodes.  Even  under that assumption, import prices are still adding around  ¼ percentage point to inflation at the end of the forecast  period.   Key Judgement 2:  as the remaining slack in the economy is  absorbed, domestic price pressures gradually increase  Labour costs are a key component of domestic inflationary  pressures.  Wage growth has remained subdued in recent years  even as unemployment has fallen (Section 3).  That, in large  part, reflects lacklustre productivity growth and a degree of  slack in the labour market.  As in previous Reports, the MPC  expects underlying productivity growth to remain well below  its pre-crisis average rate over the forecast period.  That is  partly because growth in the capital stock has slowed,  following a period of weak investment, weighing on  productivity growth.  Productivity is also likely to be  influenced by companies’ expectations about, and  preparations for, Brexit.  For example, if trading arrangements  are expected to be less open for a period, the resultant need  for some companies to reorient their business models is likely  to weigh a little on productivity growth.  Overall, weak  productivity growth is expected to reduce wage growth  relative to rates seen prior to the financial crisis.      Although subdued productivity growth and a margin of slack  can account for much of the post-crisis trend in wage growth,  most recently four-quarter wage growth has ticked down even  as the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.5%, its assumed  equilibrium.  It is possible that this weakening simply reflects  volatility in the data.  It might also reflect some employers  being less willing to commit to higher basic pay levels until  they have more certainty over future demand for their output  or the path of non-labour costs, including imports.  Over the  forecast period, whatever additional factors have held wage  growth down beyond subdued productivity growth are    2013 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Unemployment rate, per cent Chart 5.5  Unemployment projection based on market  interest rate expectations, other policy measures as  announced The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for LFS unemployment.  It has been  conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.B footnote (b).  The coloured bands have the same  interpretation as in Chart 5.1, and portray 90% of the probability distribution.  The calibration of  this fan chart takes account of the likely path dependency of the economy, where, for example,  it is judged that shocks to unemployment in one quarter will continue to have some effect on  unemployment in successive quarters.  The fan begins in 2017 Q2, a quarter earlier than the fan  for CPI inflation.  That is because Q2 is a staff projection for the unemployment rate, based in  part on data for April and May.  The unemployment rate was 4.5% in the three months to May,  and is projected to be 4.4% in Q2 as a whole.  A significant proportion of this distribution lies  below Bank staff’s current estimate of the long-term equilibrium unemployment rate.  There is  therefore uncertainty about the precise calibration of this fan chart. + – 10 5 0 5 10 15 20 1998 2001 04 07 10 13 16 19 Projection at the time of the May Report Projection consistent with MPC    key judgements in August Percentage change on a year earlier Chart 5.4  Import prices(a) Sources:  ONS and Bank calculations. (a)	 Projections are four-quarter inflation rates in Q4.  Excludes the impact of MTIC fraud.    	 Section 5  Prospects for inflation	 35 assumed to dissipate to an extent.  With the unemployment  rate remaining close to 4.5% (Chart 5.5), wage growth  therefore picks up (Table 5.C).  That is reflected in a recovery  in unit labour cost growth (Chart 5.6), which adjusts wages,  plus other employment costs such as pension contributions,  for productivity.   Although unemployment points to little slack, the period of  sluggish GDP growth in the first half of 2017 suggests a  continuing degree of spare capacity in the economy.  With  continued weakness in underlying productivity growth, the  modest pace of GDP growth over the forecast period is  sufficient to absorb that margin of slack.  That would be  consistent with a modest, cyclical, recovery in consumer  sector companies’ profit margins over the forecast period.   Overall, domestic inflationary pressures increase gradually  over the forecast period as in May.  Within that, however,  the projections for wage and unit labour cost growth are  lower than those in the MPC’s May forecast.  The impact of  lower unit cost growth on inflation is offset by a slightly  larger rebuild in profit margins for consumer sector firms.  In  May, the projections incorporated a relatively large rise in  the labour share — households’ labour income as a proportion  of UK income — as real wages were assumed to rise  significantly faster than productivity.  The Committee has  reassessed that judgement and reduced the extent of that rise.    The counterpart to this is a slightly higher path for the profit  share.  The paths for slack and domestic inflationary pressures mean  that, as in May, there is a risk that CPI inflation remains  somewhat above the target even once the boost from import  prices has dissipated.  That could come about if the period of  above-target inflation feeds through to higher inflation  expectations and, in turn, wage and price-setting behaviour.   To date, medium-term measures of inflation expectations  have remained well anchored.  In the other direction, there is a  risk that domestic pressures do not increase as much as  expected.  That could come about if the factors that have  restrained wage growth recently turn out to be more  persistent.  Additionally, consumer sector companies may not  expand profit margins as much as incorporated in the central  projection.  The Committee will monitor both these risks  closely over the coming quarters.   Key Judgement 3:  consumption grows at a subdued pace,  broadly in line with households’ real incomes  Subdued wage growth together with the impact of the lower  pound mean that real wages have fallen over the past year.   That has started to feed through to households’ spending  decisions, with quarterly consumption growth slowing to 0.4%  in 2017 Q1 and signs of further weakness in the housing  market.

It nevertheless remains subdued.   Correspondingly, household consumption grows at less than  ¼% per quarter during the first half of the forecast period and  picks up only a little later on (Table 5.C).  The profile further  out is a little lower than in May, reflecting the weaker  projection for wage growth and the effects on real income of  the further fall in the exchange rate, together with the slightly  higher yield curve (Key Judgements 1 and 2).  The saving ratio  is projected to be broadly flat (Table 5.D), once volatility  stemming from unusually large tax payments (on forestalled  dividend income) in 2017 Q1 passes (Section 2).(1)  In the  central projection, consumer credit growth slows a little next  year from current high rates.    It is possible that there could be a little more momentum in  consumption in the near term than assumed.  Despite a  marked fall in June, consumer confidence is close to its  long-run average rate and retail sales rose in Q2, following a  decline in Q1.  Households could increase spending at a faster  rate than income for a while, by reducing the amount saved or  by borrowing more than assumed.  Over time, however,  households will need to adjust spending towards the lower  level of real income consistent with the decline in the  exchange rate and the factors that underlie that decline.   It is also possible that consumption could adjust more sharply  and the saving ratio could rise.  Over the past three months,  the housing market has weakened further, with quarterly  house price inflation now around zero and transactions  remaining low (see the box on pages 17–18).  That could  suggest that households have become more pessimistic about  their wage growth or job prospects, which would also be  expected to weigh on their consumption decisions.  Over the  forecast period, house price inflation picks up gradually  (Table 5.E), but the level of house prices remains a little lower  than projected three months ago.  The weaker outlook for the  housing market is likely, over time, to feed through to slower  growth in housing investment (Table 5.C), after some support  in the near term from the recent strength in housing starts.   Given these judgements, household consumption is projected  to continue to provide less support to growth throughout the  forecast period than in the past couple of years.  The overall  growth forecast therefore depends on how much demand  rotates towards net trade and business investment. Key Judgement 4:  global growth remains strong, supporting  UK net trade and investment in the face of continued  uncertainty around Brexit Since the beginning of 2017, the MPC has revised up its  projection for global growth following indications of greater  momentum in the advanced economies.  Data since May have  (1)	 As set out in a box on pages 16–17 of the May 2017 Report, the 2017 Blue Book will  contain significant upward revisions to the level of the saving ratio.

Section 5  Prospects for inflation	 37 provided little further news on global growth (Section 1).  In  the euro area, activity indicators point to faster growth in the  near term than projected in May (Table 5.D).  Acting in the  other direction, the projection for US growth is slightly  weaker.  That reflects a smaller expected boost from fiscal  policy than previously assumed.   In the emerging economies, the outlook for growth in China  has been revised up a little following continued strong  outturns.  Growth is nonetheless expected to slow a little over  the next three years towards 6%.  That projection remains  consistent with rapid credit growth, and significant risks to  financial stability remain.    Global activity is projected to expand at around 3½% per year  based on PPP weights (Table 5.D).  Based on UK trade shares,  which are skewed more heavily towards the advanced  economies, growth is 2½% (Chart 5.7).  Both projections  Table 5.E  Monitoring risks to the Committee’s key judgements The Committee’s projections are underpinned by four key  judgements.  Risks surround all of these, and the MPC will  monitor a broad range of variables to assess the degree to  which the risks are crystallising.  The table below shows  Bank staff’s indicative near-term projections that are  consistent with the judgements in the MPC’s central view  evolving as expected.

The world outlook is therefore supportive for UK exporters.   Many are also benefiting from the lower level of the sterling  exchange rate, which increases the profitability of exporting.   The projection incorporates some effect from the prospect of  Brexit weighing on exports as companies here and abroad  begin to adjust trading relationships before the  United Kingdom leaves the European Union.  That also weighs  on import flows, which are further dampened by the higher  cost of imports.  Overall, net trade supports growth over the  forecast period.   The stronger global outlook, together with increased  incentives for exporters to expand or renew export capacity to  take advantage of the lower pound, also supports UK  investment over the forecast period.  One feature of growth  over this year has been a recovery in investment spending in  the United States and euro area.  That has been seen to a  lesser degree in UK business investment data and intentions  surveys.  There is evidence that global factors have played an  important role in UK investment in the past and the world  forecast implies that they are likely to support investment  here for much of the forecast period too.   Investment decisions also depend on domestic influences,  which are, on balance, judged to pull down investment growth  over the forecast period.  At face value, conditions for  investment are supportive at the moment — the return on  capital is high, the cost of capital is low and spare capacity is  limited.  But the anticipation of Brexit and related  uncertainties are likely to weigh on companies’ investment  plans, even assuming that those plans are based on the  expectation of a smooth transition to any new trading  arrangements.  So investment grows at a solid pace over the  forecast period (Table 5.C), but it is not as strong as would  have been expected given global and financial conditions  alone.  Investment is a little weaker than in the May Report in  the near term, consistent with the tick down in some survey  indicators, but much of that weakness is unwound over the  forecast period.   Together, the outlook for net trade and investment act to  support GDP growth during the period of subdued  consumption growth.  Even so, UK activity only grows at a  modest pace over the forecast period.      5.2	 The projections for demand,  unemployment and inflation  With recent outturns pointing to sluggish activity, the MPC  projects four-quarter growth to slow further in the near term,  a weaker path than in May.

They indicate the assessed probability of inflation relative to the target in  each quarter of the forecast period.  The 5 percentage points width of the swathes reflects the  fact that there is uncertainty about the precise probability in any given quarter, but they should  not be interpreted as confidence intervals.  	 Section 5  Prospects for inflation	 39 Committee’s view on growth in the medium term.  Based on  the judgements above and the risks around them, and under  the path for Bank Rate based on market yields and an  unchanged stock of purchased assets, the MPC projects  four-quarter growth to pick up over 2018, settling at around  1¾% thereafter, as in the May projection (Chart 5.8).   Within that, consumption growth remains subdued as  households continue to adjust to a period of weak real income  growth.  But with strong global growth, support comes from  net trade and a pickup in business investment growth.  That  outlook is consistent with expectations, on the part of  households and businesses, of a smooth transition to  post-Brexit trading arrangements.  The risks to the projection  remain skewed to the downside further out (Table 5.F),  stemming from the global outlook.  Although UK growth  remains modest, it is close to or a little above trend, such that  a small output gap at the start of the forecast closes by the  end.    Overall, CPI inflation is projected to remain around its current  rate for the next few quarters before gradually falling back.   Conditional on the market path for Bank Rate, inflation is  judged more likely to remain above the 2% target than fall  below it throughout the forecast period (Chart 5.9), reflecting  continued gradual pass-through of higher import prices.  The  ¼ percentage point overshoot of the target at the end of the  forecast period is entirely accounted for by the effect of higher  import prices.  That said, domestic pressures are increasing at  that point as the degree of spare capacity closes.  The profile,  which is conditioned on a higher path for Bank Rate and a  lower exchange rate, is very similar to that in the May Report  (Table 5.G).  The risks around the central projection for  inflation remain balanced (Chart 5.10).  Charts 5.11 and 5.12 show the MPC’s projections under the  alternative constant Bank Rate assumption, and an unchanged  stock of purchased assets.  That assumption is that Bank Rate  remains at 0.25% throughout the three years of the forecast  period, before rising towards the market path over the  subsequent three years.  Under that path, GDP growth is a  little stronger and inflation stabilises at a slightly higher rate.

Forecasters were, however, on average  attaching less weight to higher growth in coming years than  they were three months earlier.  At the two-year horizon, the  average weight on growth of 2% or more declined from  around a third to just under a quarter (Chart A). External forecasters’ central expectations for CPI inflation at  all horizons have, on average, fallen since the May Report  (Chart B).  Respondents to the most recent survey expected  inflation to fall back to 2% by 2020 Q3, on average. External forecasters’ expectations for Bank Rate have, on  average, risen by around 0.2 percentage points at the two and  three-year horizon relative to May, to 0.7% and 1.0%  respectively (Table 1).  Respondents now place an average of  just over 60% weight on Bank Rate being 0.5% or greater in  two years’ time, compared to a weight of around 45% three  months ago (Chart C).  As in May, almost all forecasters  expected the current stocks of gilt and corporate bond  purchases to remain unchanged over the next three years.

2017-11-02,"Inflation Report November 2017  On 23 November 2017, the series ‘net debt to profit’ in Chart E on page 21 was corrected.  The corrected series is around  5 percentage points higher on average than the previous incorrect series.  Inflation Report November 2017 In order to maintain price stability, the Government has set the Bank’s Monetary Policy  Committee (MPC) a target for the annual inflation rate of the Consumer Prices Index of 2%.   Subject to that, the MPC is also required to support the Government’s economic policy,  including its objectives for growth and employment. The Inflation Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff under the guidance of the members of  the Monetary Policy Committee.  It serves two purposes.  First, its preparation provides a  comprehensive and forward-looking framework for discussion among MPC members as an aid  to our decision-making.  Second, its publication allows us to share our thinking and explain the  reasons for our decisions to those whom they affect. Although not every member will agree with every assumption on which our projections are  based, the fan charts represent the MPC’s best collective judgement about the most likely paths  for inflation, output and unemployment, as well as the uncertainties surrounding those central  projections. This Report has been prepared and published by the Bank of England in accordance with  section 18 of the Bank of England Act 1998. The Monetary Policy Committee: Mark Carney, Governor Ben Broadbent, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy Jon Cunliffe, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Dave Ramsden, Deputy Governor responsible for markets and banking Andrew Haldane Ian McCafferty Michael Saunders Silvana Tenreyro Gertjan Vlieghe The Inflation Report is available in PDF alongside PowerPoint™ versions of the charts and  Excel spreadsheets of the data underlying most of them at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/inflationreport/2017/nov.aspx.

At its  meeting ending on 1 November 2017, the MPC voted by a majority of 7–2 to increase  Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 0.5%.  The Committee voted unanimously to  maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases,  financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at £10 billion.  The Committee also voted  unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the  issuance of central bank reserves, at £435 billion. The MPC’s outlook for inflation and activity in the November Inflation Report is broadly similar to its projections in  August.  In the MPC’s central forecast, conditioned on the gently rising path of Bank Rate implied by current market  yields, GDP grows modestly over the next few years at a pace just above its reduced rate of potential.  Consumption  growth remains sluggish in the near term before rising, in line with household incomes.  Net trade is bolstered by the  strong global expansion and the past depreciation of sterling.  Business investment is being affected by uncertainties  around Brexit, but it continues to grow at a moderate pace, supported by strong global demand, high rates of  profitability, the low cost of capital and limited spare capacity.  CPI inflation rose to 3.0% in September.  The MPC still expects inflation to peak above 3.0% in October, as the past  depreciation of sterling and recent increases in energy prices continue to pass through to consumer prices.  The effects of  rising import prices on inflation diminish over the next few years, and domestic inflationary pressures gradually pick up as  spare capacity is absorbed and wage growth recovers.  On balance, inflation is expected to fall back over the next year  and, conditioned on the gently rising path of Bank Rate implied by current market yields, to approach the 2% target by  the end of the forecast period.   As in previous Reports, the MPC’s projections are conditioned on the average of a range of possible outcomes for the  United Kingdom’s eventual trading relationship with the European Union.  The projections also assume that, in the  interim, households and companies base their decisions on the expectation of a smooth adjustment to that new trading  relationship. The decision to leave the European Union is having a noticeable impact on the economic outlook.  The overshoot of  inflation throughout the forecast predominantly reflects the effects on import prices of the referendum-related fall in  sterling.  Uncertainties associated with Brexit are weighing on domestic activity, which has slowed even as global growth  has risen significantly.  And Brexit-related constraints on investment and labour supply appear to be reinforcing the  marked slowdown that has been increasingly evident in recent years in the rate at which the economy can grow without  generating inflationary pressures.  Monetary policy cannot prevent either the necessary real adjustment as the United Kingdom moves towards its new  international trading arrangements or the weaker real income growth that is likely to accompany that adjustment over  the next few years.  It can, however, support the economy during the adjustment process.  The MPC’s remit specifies  that, in such exceptional circumstances, the Committee must balance any trade-off between the speed at which it  intends to return inflation sustainably to the target and the support that monetary policy provides to jobs and activity.    ii	 Inflation Report  November 2017 The steady erosion of slack has reduced the degree to which it is appropriate for the MPC to accommodate an extended  period of inflation above the target.  Unemployment has fallen to a 42-year low and the MPC judges that the level of  remaining slack is limited.  The global economy is growing strongly, domestic financial conditions are highly  accommodative and consumer confidence has remained resilient.  In line with the framework set out at the time of the  referendum, the MPC now judges it appropriate to tighten modestly the stance of monetary policy in order to return  inflation sustainably to the target.  Accordingly, the Committee voted by 7–2 to raise Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage  points, to 0.5%.  Monetary policy continues to provide significant support to jobs and activity in the current exceptional  circumstances.  All members agree that any future increases in Bank Rate would be expected to be at a gradual pace and  to a limited extent. There remain considerable risks to the outlook, which include the response of households, businesses and financial  markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal.  The MPC will respond to developments as they occur  insofar as they affect the behaviour of households and businesses, and the outlook for inflation.  The Committee will  monitor closely the incoming evidence on these and other developments, including the impact of today’s increase in  Bank Rate, and stands ready to respond to changes in the economic outlook as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return  of inflation to the 2% target.  	 Section 1  Global economic and financial market developments	 1 1	 Global economic and financial  market developments The broad‑based momentum in global growth has continued, and the outlook for the euro area in  particular has strengthened.  As growth has recovered, spare capacity in many countries is being  absorbed.  That strength has supported the prices of risky assets.  Sterling remains significantly  below its level prior to the EU referendum. Global GDP growth has been steadily picking up over the past  year and has been significantly stronger than projected in  August 2016 (Chart 1.1).  Growth in the G7, excluding the  United Kingdom, strengthened further in Q2 broadly as  projected three months ago (Section 1.1).  A number of  indicators point to a continuation of this strength in the near  term.  Survey indicators of output and new orders remain  robust.  Measures of business and consumer confidence  (Chart 1.2) are also healthy, particularly in the euro area and  United States.  Part of the pickup in global growth can be  accounted for by a recovery in investment growth.  Capital  goods orders have increased sharply (Chart 1.3).  This should,  in turn, support growth in the capital stock — the resources  and equipment available to workers to produce output — and  hence the outlook for activity further ahead. The improvement in global growth and confidence since  early 2016 has been an important factor supporting risky asset  prices and financial conditions in many countries.   Notwithstanding the firmer global backdrop, UK growth was  modest in 2017 H1 (Chart 1.1 and Section 3) and market  contacts report that investors remain cautious about the  United Kingdom’s relative growth prospects.  While volatile,  since the EU referendum the sterling ERI has remained  15%–20% below its late‑2015 peak.  In addition, the equity  prices of UK‑focused companies have underperformed their  more globally orientated peers (Section 1.2). 1.1	 Global economic developments The euro area Quarterly euro‑area GDP growth was 0.6% in Q3 (Table 1.A),  having strengthened in recent quarters (Chart 1.4).  That  pickup in growth has become increasingly broad‑based across  countries.  Growth appears to have been supported by  improving business and consumer confidence (Chart 1.2),  alongside accommodative monetary policy and easing credit  conditions.  GDP growth is projected to remain a little  above ½% in the near term, slightly stronger than projected  three months ago and consistent with business survey  + – 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 United Kingdom Range of G7,   excluding   United Kingdom(c) Average of G7,   excluding   United Kingdom(b) 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 2013 14 15 16 17 2013 14 15 16 17 Percentage changes on a year earlier Percentage changes on a quarter earlier Data at the time of the   August 2016 Report(a) Latest data(a) Chart 1.1  World GDP growth has strengthened by more  than expected UK‑weighted world GDP and GDP in the G7 economies Sources:  IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO), OECD, ONS, Thomson Reuters Datastream and  Bank calculations.

The recovery in demand has led to some slack in the labour  market being absorbed.  Euro‑area unemployment was  8.9% in September, down from 9.9% a year earlier — although  the extent of the fall in unemployment has varied across  countries (Chart 1.5).  With the recent pace of growth likely to  be maintained, unemployment is projected to fall further. Despite the fall in unemployment over the past year, wage  growth has picked up only modestly.  That may, in part, reflect  the fact that measures of underemployment — which include  people wanting to work more hours and those discouraged  from searching for work — suggest that there is still some  slack remaining in the labour market.  It may also reflect a fall  in recent years in the rate of unemployment consistent with  stable wage and price pressures — the equilibrium  unemployment rate.  Long‑term unemployment has fallen,  although it remains above pre‑crisis levels.  The extensive  labour market reforms implemented after the crisis in some  countries, such as Greece, Portugal and Spain, are likely to  have contributed to a decline in the equilibrium rate of  unemployment as well.  And labour market reforms recently  proposed in France may help to lower structural  unemployment somewhat further.  The MPC judges that there  is likely to be somewhat more slack in the euro area than  previously assumed, and the projection for activity growth is  therefore somewhat stronger than in August (Section 5). Euro‑area core inflation — which excludes the effects of  energy and food prices — was 0.9% in October, below its  historical average of 1.6% (Table 1.B).  Headline inflation was  1.4% in October.  Having pulled down headline inflation for  much of 2015 and 2016, energy prices made a small positive  contribution. The United States Quarterly US GDP growth has been broadly stable in recent  years, averaging around ½% (Table 1.A).  In recent quarters,  more of that growth has been accounted for by business  investment than over 2016.  Growth in Q3 was 0.7%, stronger  than had been projected three months ago.  And growth is  projected to remain at around those rates in the near term  (Table 1.C). Indicators suggest that there is probably little spare capacity  remaining in the US economy.  A variety of measures of labour  market slack — including the unemployment rate,  underemployment and the rate at which employees are  voluntarily leaving jobs — are around, or approaching, their  pre‑crisis lows.  That means that the pace at which activity can  grow without putting upward pressure on inflation will be  increasingly dependent on the pace of productivity growth.   Having been weak in recent years, there are signs that labour  + – 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 2012 13 14 15 16 17 Percentage change on a year earlier Chart 1.3  Capital goods orders have picked up Capital goods orders in the United States and euro area(a) Sources:  European Central Bank, Thomson Reuters Datastream, US Bureau of Labor Statistics,  US Census Bureau and Bank calculations.

Four‑quarter hourly  productivity in the non‑farm business sector grew by 1.3% in  Q2, compared with a fall of 0.4% a year earlier, although  growth remains well below pre‑crisis rates.  Productivity  growth should be supported by the recent rise in business  investment, which will support growth in the capital stock. Despite the narrowing in slack, wage growth and inflation have  remained subdued in the United States.  For example, growth  in the Employment Cost Index measure of wages was 2.5%  over the four quarters to 2017 Q3, up from around 2% in  2014–15.  The headline inflation rate was 1.6% in September,  and core inflation — excluding food and energy — was 1.3%,  both around 0.5 percentage points below their historical  averages (Table 1.B). Emerging market economies In China, GDP growth has been stable over the past two years  (Table 1.A).  In Q3, four‑quarter headline GDP growth was  6.8%, down slightly from 6.9% in Q2.  While the authorities  have taken some measures to reduce financial sector  leverage, and macroprudential policy measures have resulted  in slowing house price inflation, activity growth has continued  to be accompanied by rapid rises in credit.  Annual total social  financing growth has averaged around 13% over the past  two years, and the outstanding stock of credit to the  non‑financial sector reached 258% of GDP in 2017 Q1.  There  remain challenges for the authorities in maintaining current  rates of GDP growth while reducing risks to financial  stability.(1) Growth in other emerging market economies (EMEs) has  continued to recover over the past year, supported by:  easier  domestic financial conditions;  the recovery in  advanced‑economy demand and world trade growth;  and, for  commodity exporters, the recovery in commodity prices since  early 2016.  Growth is projected to remain robust,  notwithstanding some easing of monthly surveys of activity in  2017 Q3. 1.2	 Developments in financial markets The improvement in global growth and confidence has been  an important factor supporting risky asset prices and financial  conditions.  Market interest rates in the United States and  euro area have risen relative to 18 months ago, although they  remain low by historical standards and market‑implied paths  continue to suggest that policy rates will rise only gradually in  coming years.  Heightened geopolitical tensions over the past  few months do not appear to have had a significant effect on  investor sentiment.

Interest rates At its September meeting, the MPC voted 7–2 to leave interest  rates unchanged, and unanimously to maintain the stock of  purchased assets (see the box on page 5).  The Minutes of the  meeting stated that, conditional on the economy evolving in  such a way that slack continues to be eroded and underlying  inflationary pressure rises, the majority of the MPC considered  some withdrawal of monetary stimulus to be appropriate in  coming months.  Around the time of the announcement,  market interest rates rose.  In the run‑up to the  November Report, the market‑implied path for Bank Rate  reached 1% in three years’ time, around 0.2 percentage points  higher than at the time of the August Report (Chart 1.6).  The  details of the November decision are contained in the  Monetary Policy Summary on pages i–ii of this Report, and in  more detail in the Minutes of the meeting. In the United States, the Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) has made no changes to its target range for the  federal funds rate of 1% to 1¼% since the August Report.  But  it announced that it would begin to reduce the size of the  Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  During 2008–14, the balance  sheet grew from around US$800 billion to around  US$4.2 trillion in order to support the economy, largely  through the purchase of government debt and  mortgage‑backed securities.  The FOMC had maintained this  stock by reinvesting the proceeds of maturing assets.  From  October onwards, however, a proportion of maturing assets  will not be replaced — initially at the rate of up to  US$10 billion per month, increasing to US$50 billion per  month over the course of a year.  As a consequence, the  balance sheet will gradually shrink.  The announcement had  been widely anticipated by market contacts and appeared to  have little effect on market interest rates.  In the run‑up to the  November Report, the implied path for policy rates was  slightly steeper than in August, having risen following  stronger‑than‑expected economic data releases (Chart 1.6). The European Central Bank (ECB) has made no changes to its  policy rates since August.  In October, however, it announced  that, while it would continue its asset purchase programme  until at least September 2018, it would reduce the pace of  purchases from €60 billion to €30 billion per month from the  beginning of 2018.  There was limited market reaction to the  announcement, suggesting that it was broadly in line with  investors’ expectations.  In the run‑up to the  November Report, the market‑implied path for policy rates  was slightly flatter than in August (Chart 1.6). Longer‑term interest rates have changed little since the  August Report (Chart 1.7), although they remain higher than  18 months ago in the United States and euro area.

Section 1  Global economic and financial market developments	 5 that increase reflects a recovery in inflation compensation  (Chart 1.8), which in turn will reflect inflation expectations  and the perceptions of risks around the outlook for inflation.   Inflation compensation in the euro area and United States  drifted lower from mid‑2014, following the decline in global  commodity prices and heightened concerns about the  long‑term outlook for global activity growth.  Inflation  compensation has since recovered, and is around its past  average rate in the United Kingdom, although it remains  somewhat below average in the United States and euro area. Despite being higher than 18 months ago, long‑term interest  rates remain historically low.  That probably reflects  slow‑moving structural factors, such as demographics, which  are likely to continue to weigh on global interest rates for  some time to come.(1)  Consistent with this, market‑implied  paths continue to suggest that policy rates will rise only  gradually in coming years (Chart 1.6), particularly in  comparison to previous tightening cycles.(2) Monetary policy since the August Report The MPC’s central projection in the August Report was for  sluggish GDP growth in the near term as the squeeze on  households’ real incomes weighed on consumption.  Growth  was then judged likely to pick up to just above its modest  potential rate over the rest of the forecast period, supported  by firming net trade and business investment and by a modest  recovery in consumption growth.  Inflation was projected to  rise further above the target in the second half of 2017 as the  pass‑through of sterling’s depreciation continued.  Conditional  on the path for Bank Rate implied by market interest rates  prevailing at the time, inflation was projected to remain above  the target throughout the forecast period.  That central  projection was also conditioned on the stocks of purchased  gilts and corporate bonds remaining at £435 billion and  £10 billion respectively. At its meeting ending on 13 September 2017, the MPC noted  that the relatively limited news on activity pointed, if  anything, to a slightly stronger picture than anticipated.   Employment growth had been resilient and, as a result, the  unemployment rate had fallen to 4.3%.  In addition, weak  productivity growth had corroborated the MPC’s forecast for  modest potential supply growth.  Overall, the latest indicators  had been consistent with UK demand growth a little in excess  of this diminished rate of potential supply growth, and pointed  to the continued erosion of the remaining limited degree of  spare capacity in the economy. CPI inflation had risen to 2.9% in August, which was slightly  higher than the MPC had anticipated at the time of the  August Report.  Developments in the oil market suggested  greater near‑term upward pressure on inflation from petrol  prices, and CPI inflation was expected to rise above 3% in  October. All MPC members continued to judge that monetary policy  could need to be tightened by a somewhat greater extent than  the yield curve underpinning the August projections implied if  the economy followed a path broadly consistent with those  projections.  In addition, a majority of Committee members  judged that, if slack continued to be eroded and underlying  inflationary pressure continued to gradually build in line with  the August projections, then some withdrawal of monetary  stimulus would be likely to be appropriate over the coming  months in order to return inflation sustainably to the target.   Seven members thought that the current policy stance  remained appropriate to balance the demands of the MPC’s  remit.  Two members considered it appropriate to increase  Bank Rate by 25 basis points.  All members agreed that any  prospective increases in Bank Rate would be expected to be at  a gradual pace and to a limited extent. 0 1 2 3 4 2014 15 16 17 Euro area (HICP) Per cent United States (CPI) United Kingdom (RPI) Dashed lines:  averages since 2005   August Report Chart 1.8  Inflation compensation has recovered  somewhat since mid‑2016 Five‑year, five‑year forward inflation compensation(a) Sources:  Bloomberg and Bank calculations.

While the sterling exchange rate has fluctuated, since the  EU referendum it has remained between 15%–20% below its  November 2015 peak.  Market contacts ascribe much of that  fall to market participants having revised down UK growth  prospects relative to those in the rest of the world. Corporate capital markets Developments in capital markets influence the ease and cost  of raising finance for companies.  These financing conditions  have changed little since August, and remain more favourable  than in early 2016, supported by the improvement in the  global growth outlook (Section 1.1) and greater investor risk  appetite.  Consistent with that, financial market‑based  measures of investor uncertainty and sentiment — such as  implied volatilities — remain historically low.(2) International equity prices have risen since August  (Chart 1.10).  An important component of the cost of issuing  equity is equity risk premia — the additional return that  investors require for holding equities instead of less risky  government debt.  Risk premia for euro‑area and US equities  are estimated to have changed little since August, but remain  considerably narrower than in early 2016 and are close to their  lowest levels in ten years. Similarly to equities, the risk premia on corporate bonds — the  spread that investors require over and above government bond  yields for the additional risk of holding these assets — is also  broadly unchanged relative to three months ago, and remains  lower than in early 2016.  Although government bond yields  have risen since 2016, spreads on corporate bonds have  narrowed by more.  So overall corporate bond yields have  fallen (Chart 1.11), reducing the cost of bond financing for  companies.  That fall in the cost of debt has been particularly  marked for ‘high‑yield’ debt, which is issued by riskier  companies. Improvements in global risk sentiment do not appear,  however, to have been matched in sterling markets.  This is  most obvious in equity markets.  Much of the rise in the  FTSE All‑Share index since early 2016 (Chart 1.10) appears  primarily to have reflected the decline in the exchange rate  and its impact on the sterling value of profits earned on  overseas operations.  Consistent with that, equity prices of  (1)	 See Broadbent, B (2017), ‘Brexit and the pound’;  www.bankofengland.co.uk/ publications/Documents/speeches/2017/speech969.pdf.

Despite significant falls in the  United States and euro area since early 2016, equity risk  premia on the FTSE All‑Share index are estimated to have  been broadly unchanged. Bank funding costs Capital markets also matter for broader credit conditions  through their influence on bank funding costs.  Although they  have been broadly stable since August, the spreads that banks  pay for funding over and above market interest rates have  narrowed significantly over the past year (Chart 1.13).  This  has contributed to many retail interest rates faced by  household and companies falling to historically low levels  (Section 2), and by more than the fall in market rates  (Chart 1.14).  As explained in the box on pages 18–21, the  recent rises in market interest rates are expected to feed  through gradually into higher rates for households and  companies, unwinding some of the recent declines in these  retail rates.  Market interest rates and bank funding costs,  however, remain low by historical standards. 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 Jan. July Jan. July Jan. July Jan.

Consumption growth is projected to remain subdued in the near  term before picking up gradually as that squeeze abates.  Offsetting some of the weakness in  consumption, business investment growth and net trade have risen, probably reflecting the  depreciation and strong global demand.  They should continue to support modest overall growth in  the near term. Sterling depreciated sharply following the EU referendum and,  since then, has remained 15%–20% below its late-2015 peak  (Section 1).  That is raising UK import prices (Section 4) and  weighing on growth in households’ real income and spending.   Set against that, the depreciation, along with the strength of  global demand (Section 1), is also likely to be supporting  growth in exports, exporters’ profits and thus investment in  export capacity.  Consistent with these developments,  following the latest data revisions the slowing in GDP growth  since the referendum has been accounted for by a steady  weakening in consumption growth (Chart 2.1).  Partly  offsetting that, business investment growth and net trade  have picked up (Table 2.A). Consumption growth is expected to remain subdued over the  next year, before picking up gradually as real income growth  recovers somewhat (Section 2.1).  Housing investment should  be supported by the recent stabilisation in activity and prices  in the housing market (Section 2.2).  In addition, the strength  in global growth should continue to support business  investment (Section 2.4) and net trade (Sections 2.5 and 2.6).   The outlook for demand will, however, depend crucially on  how households and companies anticipate and respond to the  prospect of the United Kingdom’s departure from the  European Union. 2.1	 Household spending The impact of sterling’s depreciation on inflation (Section 4)  has weighed on households’ purchasing power.  Despite  support from robust employment growth in recent  quarters (Section 3), real pre-tax labour income is expected  to have been flat over the year to 2017 Q3 (Chart 2.2).  Real  income growth is projected to start to recover gradually in  2018, although to remain modest.  That reflects imported  inflation falling back and a pickup in pay growth (Section 4),  which outweigh the effects of slower employment  growth.

Section 2  Demand	 9 Following recent data revisions, consumption growth is  estimated to have slowed only gradually over the year to  2017 Q2, less sharply than household real income growth.  As  a result, the saving ratio — the proportion of overall income  that households save — declined (Chart 2.3).  The overall level  of the saving ratio in recent years has, however, been revised  up reflecting an improved, and higher, measure of dividend  income.  The box on pages 12–13 describes these revisions in  more detail.  Moreover, although the current saving ratio is  still somewhat below its past average level, some parts of  household income such as those going directly to pension  schemes are likely to be less relevant for current spending  decisions.(1)  A measure of saving out of available income,  which excludes those elements, has also fallen over the past  year but is around its historical average level (Chart 2.3). The pace at which households continue to moderate their  spending growth in response to the current squeeze in real  income growth will depend on a number of factors.  One of  those is how confident households are about their future  income growth.  Aggregate consumer confidence (Chart 1.2)  and, within that, households’ expectations of their personal  financial situation have fallen over the past two years, but only  to slightly below their long-run averages. Retail interest rates can also affect household spending.  In  recent years, interest rates on mortgages, consumer credit and  deposits have all fallen to historically low levels (Chart 2.4).   In aggregate, that will have supported household spending  growth, in part by lowering the cost of consuming now relative  to in the future and by reducing debt-servicing costs for  borrowers.  In addition to the fall in interest rates, broader  lending conditions in the consumer credit market have eased  and growth in consumer credit has been rapid in recent years.   As explained in the box on pages 16–17, the impact of rapid  consumer credit growth in recent years on spending growth is  likely to have been relatively modest and there are some signs  that overall consumer credit conditions are starting to tighten  slightly. Following the recent rise in market interest rates (Section 1),  household interest rates are expected to pick up gradually,  though to remain at low levels.  The box on pages 18–21  explores the likely impact on households’ interest payments,  using results on the distribution of household balance sheets  from the recent Bank/NMG survey.  Quarterly consumption growth is expected to have picked up  slightly from 0.2% in Q2 to 0.3% in Q3.  Some of the  weakness in spending in Q2 looks to have been erratic, with  car purchases declining sharply.  That decline is broadly  Table 2.A  Net trade supported GDP growth in Q2 Expenditure components of demand(a) Percentage changes on a quarter earlier 	 	 	 	 Averages 	 1998–	 2008–	 2010–	 2013–	 2016	 2017	 2017  	 2007	 09	 12	 15	    	 Q1	    Q2 Household consumption(b)	 0.9	 -0.5	 0.1	 0.6	 0.6	 0.3	 0.2 Private sector investment	 0.5	 -4.6	 2.0	 0.9	 0.6	 1.6	 -0.6   of which, business   investment(c)	 0.5	 -3.4	 2.2	 0.4	 0.5	 0.8	 0.5   of which, private sector    housing investment	 0.6	 -7.0	 1.5	 2.3	 1.0	 3.6	 -2.9 Private sector final domestic    demand	 0.8	 -1.1	 0.5	 0.9	 0.5	 0.6	 0.1 Government consumption    and investment(c)	 0.9	 0.9	 -0.2	 0.3	 0.5	 -0.4	 0.9 Final domestic demand	 0.8	 -0.7	 0.3	 0.8	 0.5	 0.4	 0.3 Change in inventories(d)(e)	 0.0	 0.0	 0.1	 0.0	 -0.1	 0.1	 -0.1 Alignment adjustment(e)	 0.0	 -0.1	 0.0	 0.0	 -0.1	 -0.1	 -0.2 Domestic demand(f)	 0.8	 -0.8	 0.4	 0.8	 0.2	 0.7	 -0.1 ‘Economic’ exports(g)	 1.1	 -1.0	 0.8	 0.9	 0.9	 -0.3	 1.7 ‘Economic’ imports(g)	 1.4	 -1.2	 0.8	 1.3	 0.7	 1.0	 0.2 Net trade(e)(g)	 -0.1	 0.1	 0.0	 -0.1	 0.0	 -0.4	 0.4 Real GDP at market prices	 0.7	 -0.7	 0.4	 0.7	 0.4	 0.3	 0.3 Memo:  nominal GDP at    market prices	 1.2	 -0.2	 0.9	 0.9	 1.2	 0.8	 0.7 (a)	 Chained-volume measures unless otherwise stated.

Since then, car  registrations have bounced back somewhat.  Retail sales  volumes rose in Q3 and, together with survey indicators, point  to modest consumption growth.  Housing market activity —  which tends to correlate fairly well with consumption growth  — picked up slightly (Section 2.2). As at the time of the August Report, consumption growth is  projected to remain subdued in the near term (Table 2.B),  reflecting continued slow real income growth and the ongoing  adjustment to the past squeeze in real income growth.   Further ahead, consumption growth is projected to rise  gradually as the drag from sterling’s depreciation on real  income growth diminishes and wage growth picks up  (Section 5). 2.2	 Housing market As well as contributing directly to GDP through housing  investment, activity in the housing market can provide a signal  about household spending.  This is in part because decisions  about whether to buy a house and how much to consume  tend to be driven by common factors such as interest rates,  income growth and confidence.  Rises in house prices can also  affect spending by raising the value of homeowners’ equity,  which they can then use as collateral against which to borrow,  although this effect is estimated to be small.(1) As discussed in the box on pages 17–18 of the August Report,  the housing market slowed in 2017 H1, consistent with the  squeeze in household income growth and subdued  consumption growth.  Since then, housing transactions,  mortgage approvals and house price inflation have been  slightly stronger than expected (Chart 2.6).  That may in  part reflect further falls in mortgage interest rates in Q3  (Section 1). The outlook for the housing market remains fairly subdued,  with the balance of respondents to the September RICS  housing survey reporting lower price and sales expectations for  the coming months than earlier in the year.  In the near term,  price inflation and activity in the housing market are projected  to remain well below past averages, broadly consistent with  the outlook for income and consumption. While housing investment was weak in Q2 (Table 2.A), the  stabilisation in housing activity should provide some support  to measured housing investment in the near term.  That is  because around a fifth of such investment is made up of  services associated with property transactions, such as estate  agents’ and solicitors’ fees.

New  housing starts have picked up by 20% since the start of 2016,  although they fell back slightly in Q2.  Housing investment  growth overall is projected to be fairly subdued in coming  quarters (Table 2.B). 2.3	 Government spending Public sector net borrowing was estimated to have been  £32.5 billion between April and September 2017, the smallest  figure at this point in the fiscal year since 2007.  In addition,  estimates of borrowing in the fiscal year 2016/17 have been  revised down significantly since the initial estimate, in part  reflecting an upward revision to income tax and VAT receipts. The MPC’s forecasts are conditioned on the Government’s tax  and spending plans detailed in the Spring 2017 Budget.  Under  these plans, the fiscal consolidation continues, weighing on  overall GDP growth over the MPC’s forecast period. 2.4	 Business investment Following recent upward revisions, business investment is  estimated to have grown by 2½% in the year to 2017 Q2  (Chart 2.7), slightly above its past average rate.  Nevertheless,  past falls mean that the level of investment remains low  relative to the size of the capital stock.  That will continue to  weigh on growth in the capital stock and thus on productivity  and potential supply growth (Section 3). Survey evidence suggests that the continuing strength of  global demand (Section 1) and high profit margins on export  sales following sterling’s depreciation are likely to be  supporting investment in export capacity.  In addition, the rate  of return on capital, as measured by the ONS, remains high  and spare capacity appears to be fairly limited (Section 3). Set against that, the depreciation of sterling will also  have raised the cost of investment because, with the  main exception of buildings, investment is relatively  import-intensive.  In addition, a number of surveys suggest  that the anticipation of Brexit and related uncertainties are  weighing on investment.  For instance, in a recent survey on  investment intentions by the Bank’s Agents, economic  uncertainty, expected changes to future UK trading  arrangements and other Brexit factors were the most  commonly cited factors weighing on investment plans.  While retained earnings are the most important source of  finance for capital spending, borrowing conditions can also  affect investment.  The cost of corporate bond issuance  (Section 1) and of bank borrowing have fallen and credit  availability for many businesses has improved in recent years.   40 50 60 70 80 2010 12 14 16 Thousands per month Mortgage approvals   for house purchase    8 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 2010 12 14 16 Quarter-on-quarter annualised percentage change House prices(a) + – 0 Chart 2.6  House price inflation has stabilised having  slowed earlier in 2017  Mortgage approvals for house purchase and house prices Sources:  Bank of England, IHS Markit, Nationwide and Bank calculations.

The  2017 Blue Book was published in October along with the  2017 Pink Book, which contained revisions to the Balance of  Payments.(1)  Revisions to overall GDP and expenditure data  were fairly small and are described elsewhere in Sections 2  and 3.  Revisions to the allocation of income and wealth  between sectors of the economy were, however, more  material.  This box describes those changes in more detail. Revisions to the sectoral allocation of income There were two key revisions to the allocation of income.  The  first was a reallocation of income from the corporate to the  household sector.(2)  As discussed in the box on pages 16–17 of  the May Report, the ONS has switched to using HMRC tax  data to estimate dividend income.  Those data suggest that  household dividend income has risen sharply over the past  two decades, from around 1.7% of pre-tax household income  in 1997 to 4.5% in 2016, as an increasing number of the  self-employed have chosen to incorporate their businesses and  to take part of their income in the form of dividends.(3) That upward revision to dividend income has led to the  household saving ratio also being revised up (Section 2).  As a  result, the household financial balance — which captures the  difference between household saving and investment — is now  estimated to have been positive rather than negative over  much of the recent past (Chart A).  The counterpart to the rise  in household dividend income has been a fall in the income of  companies who have paid out those dividends.  That revision  has pushed down on the corporate financial balance, which is  now estimated to have been negative over most of the past  five years.  The second key revision primarily affects the allocation of  income between the corporate sector and the rest of the  world.  As discussed in the May Report, the ONS has revised  up the amount of interest that is estimated to have been paid  on UK corporate bonds.  That has further reduced corporate  sector income and thus the corporate financial balance  (Chart A), since companies are now estimated to have been  paying more interest on their debt. A significant proportion of those higher interest payments are  estimated to have been paid abroad.  As a result, the current  account deficit, as a proportion of GDP, has been revised  around 1 percentage point wider on average since 2006  (Chart B).  The current account deficit is estimated to have  widened to 4.6% of GDP in 2017 Q2, from 4.4% in Q1,  compared with 3.4% in the Q1 data available at the time of  the August Report.  Those revisions reflect a more negative  balance on primary income — the net value of investment  income received by UK residents.  In contrast, the trade  balance was broadly unrevised. (1)	 For articles outlining the revisions in more detail, see https://www.ons.gov.uk/ economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/articles/nationalaccountsarticles/ previousReleases.  (2)	 Throughout, the household sector refers to households and non-profit institutions  serving households (NPISH).  As part of the changes incorporated in the  2017 Blue Book, however, estimates for households and NPISH are now presented  separately as well as jointly in the National Accounts. (3)	The upward revision to dividend income is partly offset by a reduction in mixed  income — the income of the self-employed — in recent years, as sole traders that  incorporated moved from the household to the corporate sector.   4 2 0 2 4 6 8 Percentages of nominal GDP Households(a) 4 2 0 2 4 6 2007 09 11 13 15 17 Private non-ﬁnancial corporations     Solid lines:  latest data     Dashed lines:  data at the time of the August Report  Percentages of nominal GDP + – + – 2007 09 11 13 15 17 Chart A  Households are now estimated to have been  net savers over much of the recent past while companies  have been net borrowers Household and private non-financial corporation financial  balances (a)	 Includes non-profit institutions serving households. 8 6 4 2 0 2 2006 08 10 12 14 16 Primary income balance Secondary income balance Trade balance Current account balance Percentages of nominal GDP    Solid line:  latest data    Dashed line:  data at the time of the August Report      + – Chart B  The current account deficit has been revised  wider UK current account  	 Section 2  Demand	 13 Revisions to the sectoral allocation of wealth The Blue Book and Pink Book also contained revisions to the  allocation of wealth between sectors of the economy.  While  estimates of household debt are broadly unchanged from  previously published data, the stock of household financial  assets has been revised down by £96 billion in 2016, or 2% of  household net financial wealth.  Most of that downward  revision reflects lower estimated entitlements from defined  contribution pension schemes as a result of a switch to using  data from The Pensions Regulator.  Those lower pension  entitlements have correspondingly raised the net wealth of  the corporate sector.   The changes incorporated in the Pink Book also have  implications for the net international investment position  (NIIP) — the stock of UK foreign assets less the liabilities owed  to other countries.  Since those assets, net of liabilities, can be  used to finance the current account deficit, the level of the  NIIP may affect investors’ perceptions of how sustainable a  given current account deficit is likely to be. The official measure of the NIIP in 2016 has been revised down  by 20% of GDP (Chart C).  That downward revision primarily  reflects updated benchmarking of share ownership using the  2012 and 2014 Share Ownership Surveys, which suggest that  the value of UK equities held overseas is higher than previously  thought.  The counterpart to that higher wealth held overseas  is a smaller amount of wealth held by financial corporations in  the United Kingdom.  Overall, the NIIP is now estimated to be slightly negative as a  share of annual GDP.  The values of foreign direct investment  (FDI) assets and liabilities within that are, however, difficult to  measure accurately.(1)  Official estimates use the book or  purchase value of these assets.  Another approach is to try to  adjust for changes in the market value using movements in  equity prices.  One such measure suggests that, despite the  downward revision, the NIIP remains significantly positive, at  around 75% of GDP (Chart C). 40 20 0 20 40 60 80 100 1997 99 2001 03 05 07 09 11 13 15 17 Percentages of annualised nominal GDP Solid lines:  latest data   Dashed lines:  data at the time of the August Report  Estimates based on FDI adjusted   for changes in market value(b)      ONS data   + – Chart C  The UK net international investment position  has been revised down Estimates of the UK net international investment position(a) Sources:  Bloomberg, ONS and Bank calculations.

The box on  pages 18–21 explores the likely impact of a rise in interest  rates on companies’ financing conditions. Total net finance raised by companies remained robust in Q3,  driven by a pickup in bond issuance (Chart 2.8).  Having risen  sharply in Q2, bank lending fell back;  but that volatility largely  reflected the effects of a few large mergers and acquisitions  during the summer. Investment growth is expected to have slowed slightly in  2017 Q3, before picking back up to rates broadly consistent  with surveys of investment intentions on average (Chart 2.7).   That is a similar outlook to that in August (Table 2.B), but  weaker than would have been expected given global and  financial conditions alone (Section 5). 2.5	 Exports The strength in global demand, along with the depreciation in  sterling (Section 1), is likely to be supporting growth in export  volumes.  Between 2015 Q4 and 2017 Q2, export prices fell by  5% in foreign currency terms, suggesting some improvement  in competitiveness.  But they rose by 12% in sterling terms,  meaning that the profit margins on exports are also likely to  have increased.  That rise in margins is likely to support an  expansion in export volumes among firms with spare capacity.   As that capacity is eroded, and for firms with limited spare  capacity, those higher margins should also provide an  incentive to invest (Section 2.4), thus boosting export volumes  further over time.  The outlook for exports and related  investment will, however, also depend on how both domestic  and foreign companies anticipate and respond to changes in  the United Kingdom’s trading arrangements. In the latest data, growth in export volumes over the year to  Q2 was robust, at 5% (Chart 2.9).  Growth in exports of goods  — just over half of the total — was particularly strong.  Capital  and intermediate goods accounted for much of that strength,  consistent with the strength in global capital goods orders  (Section 1). Four-quarter growth in aggregate exports is expected to have  risen further in Q3, broadly in line with survey indicators  (Chart 2.9).  Further ahead, export growth is projected to slow  somewhat but will continue to be supported by the strength in  global growth and the recent rise in exporters’ margins  (Section 5).

Section 2  Demand	 15 2.6	 Imports and net trade Growth in imports will depend on growth in overall final  demand as well as its composition, as some components are  more import-intensive than others.  In addition, sterling’s  depreciation is likely to encourage some substitution away  from imports towards domestically produced goods and  services, which have become relatively cheaper. Import growth was solid over the year to Q2.  That was  mainly accounted for by strong growth in goods imports,  which in part appears to reflect buoyant final demand for  UK exports that tend to be embedded in global supply chains  (Section 2.5).  Relative to overall final demand, however,  import volumes have increased over the past year  (Chart 2.10).  That may in part be because relative import  prices remain lower than over most of the past decade, even  after the recent pickup.  In addition, following a rise in import  prices, it typically takes some time for producers of domestic  substitutes to increase output due to capacity constraints and  the need to shift resources, and for companies reliant on  imports to adjust existing supply chains.  Partly as a result of  those constraints starting to diminish, import growth is  projected to slow in coming quarters. Following recent revisions, net trade is estimated to have  contributed positively to GDP growth in recent quarters  (Chart 2.1).  In Q3, net trade is expected to have subtracted  from GDP growth, mainly reflecting a change in the direction  of trade in non-monetary gold from a net export in Q2 to a  net import in Q3.  That is a volatile component of UK trade,  reflecting activity in the London gold bullion market, and has  no impact on aggregate demand;  movements in  non‑monetary gold are offset by movements in private sector  investment in valuables.  This component, and therefore  overall net trade, is likely to bounce back in Q4.  Net trade is  projected to continue to provide further support in coming  quarters (Table 2.B), as import growth slows by more than  export growth (Section 5). 80 85 90 95 100 105 75 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 1998 2000 02 04 06 08 10 12 14 16 Index:  2011 = 100 Import penetration(a)   (right-hand scale)  Relative import prices(b)   (left-hand scale, inverted)     Index:  2011 = 100   Chart 2.10  Import penetration has continued to increase  despite higher import prices Imports relative to import-weighted demand and relative import  prices (a)	 UK imports as a proportion of import-weighted total final expenditure, chained-volume  measures.

Table 2.B  Monitoring the MPC’s key judgements  16	 Inflation Report  November 2017 Developments in consumer credit Consumer credit includes household borrowing through credit  cards, dealership car finance and other unsecured debt such as  personal loans.  Although only 11% of the stock of household  debt, strong consumer credit growth (Chart A) has accounted  for around a third of the overall increase in net lending to  households since 2012.  This box explores the possible drivers  of this growth and the characteristics of the households who  have taken out consumer credit recently.  It then examines the  ways in which such credit can influence household spending,  before discussing the outlook for consumer credit. Drivers of the growth in consumer credit in recent  years Robust household demand is likely to have supported  consumer credit growth over 2014–16.  Consumer confidence  and, within that, households’ expectations of their personal  financial situation were above their past average rates over  much of this period (Section 2).  This, together with steady  falls in unemployment (Section 3), will have encouraged  households to make major purchases and, for some, to take  out consumer credit to help smooth out the costs of financing  those purchases. In addition, there has been a material easing in consumer  credit supply conditions in recent years, reflecting intense  competition and falls in bank funding costs (Section 1).  For  example, the quoted interest rate on a £10,000 personal loan  has fallen by around 4 percentage points since 2012, reaching  a record low in 2017 H1 (Table 1).  Other terms and conditions  have also eased, with a marked lengthening in interest-free  periods on credit card balance transfers. Furthermore, there has been a structural shift in the way car  purchases are financed, with around 90% of new cars bought  with dealership car finance in 2016, compared with around  50% in 2009.  Such finance typically involves personal  contract purchases (PCP), a type of agreement with fixed  monthly payments that are lower than other forms of car  finance.  That is because at the end of the loan customers  either make an additional payment for a pre-agreed amount  to purchase the car or return the vehicle to the dealer.  This  structural shift will have boosted consumer credit growth,  partly because the entire amount of PCP loans are recorded as  credit, even though not all customers will make that final  payment to purchase the car. Dealership car finance has accounted for around half of the  overall increase in consumer credit since 2013 (Chart A), and  will have boosted overall consumer credit growth.  As much of  that shift in the way car purchases are financed has now  occurred, the strong contribution from dealership car finance  to consumer credit growth has started to fall and is likely to  ease somewhat further in coming years.(1)  Around half of the growth in the stock of consumer credit over  2015 and 2016 is estimated to have been concentrated in  borrowers who did not previously have such debt.  According  to Bank/NMG surveys carried out in 2017, households who  had recently taken out consumer credit were more likely to  have high incomes.  Around 40% of households with  consumer credit also held savings in excess of the balance on  their consumer debt.  And around half of households who also  had a mortgage reported that, on balance, it was cheaper or  easier to obtain a personal loan than to increase their  mortgage borrowing.

Section 2  Demand	 17 According to the latest NMG survey, the proportion of  households reporting that unsecured debt is a burden picked  up in 2017 but remains below recent highs (Chart B).  Perhaps  consistent with that, lenders responding to the Q3 Credit  Conditions Survey reported that default rates had increased a  little, although the performance of consumer credit lending  remained generally strong.   Links between consumer credit growth and  consumption Developments in household spending growth are likely to be  reflected in demand for consumer credit.  But in addition,  changes in consumer credit driven by an increase in credit  supply can boost spending directly.  One crude way of gauging  the size of such effects is simply to compare increases in the  net flow of new consumer credit with increases in  consumption.  On that basis, since 2012 the increase in the  flow of consumer credit accounted for only 8% of the increase  in consumption. The actual impact of consumer credit growth on spending,  however, could well be smaller or larger than that simple  approach.  On the one hand, not all consumer credit  necessarily generates additional spending as some households  who take out credit to spend may have savings they would  otherwise have used.  On the other hand, any increase in  spending due to increases in credit growth is likely to support  demand and so overall household income.  That can then lead  to further increases in spending over and above the initial  boost.  Overall, it appears unlikely that the increase in the net  flow of consumer credit has been a material driver of the  increase in consumption in recent years. Recent developments and the outlook Four-quarter growth in consumer credit has eased slightly over  2017, to 9.9% in Q3 (Chart A).  That appears largely to reflect  softer demand for credit, with consumption growth slowing in  recent quarters (Section 2.1).  In particular, growth in car  finance has eased, consistent with the weakness in new car  purchases, although part of that easing is also likely to reflect  the end of the structural shift in the way car purchases are  financed. There are also signs that consumer credit supply conditions  may have started to tighten slightly.  The average interest-free  period on credit card balance transfers has shortened a little  (Table 1).  And in the latest Credit Conditions Survey, lenders  reported that unsecured credit availability had fallen in Q3  and was expected to fall further in Q4.  Nevertheless,  competition in the consumer credit market remains intense.   Consumer credit growth is projected to remain robust,  although to moderate further in coming years (Section 5), in  part as the structural shift towards greater use of dealership  finance in car purchases continues to run its course. Developments in consumer credit are relevant to financial  stability.  As discussed in the June 2017 Financial Stability  Report, falling interest margins on lending do not appear to  have been accompanied by a corresponding improvement in  the underlying credit quality of new lending.  The Prudential  Regulation Authority’s (PRA’s) review of consumer credit  lending, published in July, found that the resilience of lenders’  portfolios had been falling.(1)  In the Record of its September  meeting, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) set out that it  judges that there is a pocket of risk in the rapid growth of  consumer credit.(2)  While not a material risk to economic  growth through its effect on household spending, it is a risk to  banks’ ability to withstand severe economic downturns and  therefore potentially to financial stability.  The FPC has  responded to this risk by accelerating its analysis of credit  losses that banks could incur in the very deep recession  encapsulated in the 2017 annual stress-test scenario.   Although the overall credit quality of consumer credit has  improved significantly since the financial crisis, the FPC judges  that lenders overall are placing too much weight on the recent  performance of loans in benign conditions as an indicator of  underlying credit quality.  As a result, they have been  underestimating the losses they could incur in a downturn.   This is just one element of the overall stress test, results for  which will be published on 28 November and used to set  regulatory capital buffers.

As a result, interest rates for households and  companies fell significantly.  In August 2016, as the economy  showed early signs of an abrupt hit to activity and confidence  following the EU referendum, the MPC voted to introduce a  package of measures to support the economy.  That included a  further cut in Bank Rate to 0.25%.(1)  These measures were  calibrated to balance the trade‑off that emerged immediately  after the referendum between ensuring a sustainable return of  inflation to the target and supporting jobs and activity.  Since  then, funding costs of banks have also declined significantly  relative to reference rates (Section 1), and so many household  and corporate interest rates have fallen further to historically  low levels (Chart 1.14 and Chart 2.4). More recently, market interest rates have risen slightly  reflecting expectations that the MPC will raise Bank Rate  (Section 1).  While that market‑implied path for Bank Rate  implies only a very gradual rise in coming years, it does imply  some unwinding of the most recent falls in interest rates for  households and companies. Changes in the current and expected level of Bank Rate  influence spending through a number of channels.  They can  affect the exchange rate, and therefore external demand.   They influence domestic demand via changes in domestic  asset prices and levels of wealth. A more direct channel operates via retail interest rates.  By  raising the real cost of borrowing and the return on saving,  rises in interest rates reduce the incentive to spend today  relative to in the future.  They also raise payments on existing  debt and deposits.  Spending by net borrowers tends to be  more sensitive to these changes in cash flow than net savers,  reducing spending in aggregate. This box examines the impact of changes in Bank Rate on  those cash flows, across households and firms.  It draws on a  range of evidence including the latest Bank/NMG survey of  household finances.(2) Households Pass-through to effective interest rates facing  households By raising the cost at which banks can obtain funding,  increases in Bank Rate and market interest rates will increase  the interest rates on new borrowing and deposits for  households.  How quickly that feeds through to the interest  rates on existing saving and borrowing will depend on the  proportion of those balances that are ‘floating rate’ — linked  to Bank Rate or market interest rates.  For savers and  borrowers with ‘fixed‑rate’ products, the interest rates on  those products will only change when the fixed‑rate period  comes to an end. Around a third of households have a mortgage on their home.   In aggregate, mortgage debt represents around three quarters  of the overall stock of household debt.  The share of fixed‑rate  mortgages by value has risen significantly in recent years to  around 60% of the stock of mortgages (Chart A).  So while a  change in Bank Rate would feed through to some mortgages  quite quickly, the overall effect would be relatively gradual.   Even as interest rates start to rise, past falls (Chart 2.4) may  mean that some mortgagors will continue to move onto lower  interest rates than they had previously, when their fixed rates  expire.  For example, someone moving from an expiring  five‑year fixed rate to a new one could see rates fall by around  200 basis points, and for two‑year fixed rates the fall could  be around 30 basis points.

(b)	 More granular breakdowns are included from the earliest point at which the data were  collected.  	 Section 2  Demand	 19 Other components of household borrowing — such as  consumer credit and student loans — are less directly sensitive  to Bank Rate.  The interest rates on these products tend to be  either fixed rate (Table 1) or driven predominantly by factors  other than Bank Rate (for consumer credit, see the box on  pages 16–17).  In particular, the size of monthly repayments on  student loans are determined entirely by borrower income and  are unrelated to the loan interest rate or principal outstanding.    On loans extended since 2012–13, borrowers repay 9% of  income above £21,000 and nothing if earnings are below this  threshold. By comparison, only around one quarter of household deposits  are fixed rate (Table 1).  So a rise in Bank Rate may feed  through to effective saving rates more quickly than to  borrowing rates on average. Sensitivity of household income to changes in interest  rates As a rise in interest rates is passed through, the sizes of  household debt and deposits will determine the direct  ‘cash‑flow’ impact on households’ income and spending.  In  aggregate, total debt‑servicing costs relative to income —  interest payments plus repayments of principal — have fallen  fairly steadily in recent years (Chart B).  That has been more  than accounted for by a decline in interest payments, which  are at a historically low level relative to income.  Principal  repayments have risen relative to income. Among the third of households who have a mortgage on their  home, the average outstanding balance in June 2017 was  around £125,000 with an average repayment term of 16 years  remaining.  Once passed on in full, a 25 basis point rise in  Bank Rate would lead to an increase in the servicing cost of  that average mortgage of around £15 a month.  Just over a  fifth of those who have a mortgage, around two million  households, are likely to have never experienced a rise in  Bank Rate since they became a mortgagor.  Almost half of  those are estimated to have taken out a mortgage since  July 2014, when the FPC’s Recommendation on affordability  tests was implemented.  As a result, those households will  have been tested when taking out the mortgage to ensure  they can still afford their mortgages were Bank Rate to rise by  300 basis points. The majority of households do not have mortgages.  And, in  aggregate, the stock of household debt has fallen since prior to  the crisis, relative to household income (Chart C).  Student  loans, in particular, have accounted for an increasing share of  aggregate debt in recent years.  Excluding student loans, the  fall in debt over the past decade as a proportion of income is  Table 1  Proportion of the stock of UK-resident bank and building  society loans and deposits at fixed rate(a) Per cent 	 2008 Q1	 2017 Q3 Secured lending to households	 45	 59 Consumer credit lending to households	 68	 80 Lending to private non-financial corporations(b)	 n.a.	 12 Deposits from households(c)(d)	 17	 26 Deposits from private non-financial corporations(c)(d)	 46	 44 (a)	 Average UK MFI daily balances on sterling household loans and deposits reported on form ER (effective  rates), and balance sheet data reported on forms BE and BT.

Student loans are likely to continue to  push up household debt in coming years;  excluding them,  debt is projected to grow broadly in line with income. In addition to the fall in aggregate debt relative to income,  deposits have risen faster than income over the past decade.   As a result, the direct impact of an increase in Bank Rate on  household cash flow in aggregate may be more modest now  than in the recent past.  For example, based on the current  stock of debt and deposits and assuming full and immediate  pass‑through to both, including non‑mortgage debt, a  25 basis point rise in interest rates would increase monthly net  interest payments by £4 per household, on average, equivalent  to a reduction of 0.1% of post‑tax income.  Because a greater  share of mortgages are fixed rate than deposits, though, this  would be somewhat smaller at first, and take some time to  come through. The impact on spending of a rise in interest rates via this  cash‑flow channel will depend on how households respond.   Evidence from the NMG survey in recent years suggests that  the spending of net borrowers is more sensitive than that of  net savers to changes in their cash flow.  For example, the  results suggest that in response to an extra £20 of interest  payments, borrowers would reduce spending by around £10  on average.  In contrast, in response to an increase of £20 in  their interest income, savers on average would increase  spending by only £2.  The latest findings from the 2017 H2  NMG survey suggest the sizes of those responses are likely to  be similar or slightly smaller than in the past. Even within these broad categories there are likely to be  significant variations in the response to a change in interest  rates.  Mortgagors with relatively high debt‑servicing ratios  may need to cut back spending by more if interest rates rise.   As explained on page 4 of the June 2017 Financial Stability  Report, high mortgage debt‑servicing ratios are typically  associated with a sharp increase in the incidence of repayment  difficulties.  The NMG survey suggests that, having fallen  during the financial crisis, the share of households with a  mortgage debt‑servicing ratio above 40% of pre‑tax income  has risen since 2015 (Chart D).  That share remains around  pre‑crisis lows, however, and a 25 basis point rise in interest  rates — even if passed through fully and immediately to all  mortgage rates — would increase the share only slightly (the  diamond in Chart D).  It would probably take a further rise of  around 1½ percentage points before this proportion returned  to its pre‑crisis average of 2%, even assuming no rise in  nominal incomes. Companies The sensitivity of business investment to increases in interest  rates will depend on how the overall cost of finance facing  companies is affected, and how reliant businesses are on  borrowing to fund investment. Pass‑through to companies’ financing costs The vast majority of corporate bank debt has a floating  interest rate (Table 1).  While some companies will purchase  financial instruments to hedge their floating‑rate exposures  and so reduce their sensitivity to changes in interest rates,  market intelligence suggests that has become less common in  recent years.  Any rise in Bank Rate is therefore likely to pass  through fairly quickly to the cost of bank borrowing for  companies. In aggregate, however, UK private non‑financial corporations  (PNFCs) have reduced their reliance on bank debt since 2009.   This is partly due to a significant deleveraging in the  commercial real estate sector, which in 2009 accounted for  over 40% of aggregate corporate debt.  Intelligence from the  Bank’s Agents suggests that it also reflects a broader shift in  the way businesses finance investment.  Companies now use a  greater proportion of financing from internal funds and, for  large companies, bond and equity issuance (Chart 2.8). In addition, company deposits have continued to grow  steadily.  As a result, the size of companies’ overall debt net of  deposits has fallen materially relative to their profits in recent  years (Chart E).  That will have reduced the negative impact of  any rise in interest rates on the profitability of the corporate  sector. 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 1991 93 95 97 99 2001 03 05 07 09 11 13 15 17 Percentages of households Bank/NMG survey  BHPS/Understanding   Society surveys  Chart D  The proportion of households with a high  debt-servicing ratio is relatively low Proportion of households with a mortgage debt‑servicing ratio  above 40% of pre‑tax income(a) Sources:  British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), NMG Consulting survey,  Understanding Society (US) and Bank calculations.

Percentage of households with mortgage debt‑servicing ratio above 40% is  calculated using BHPS (1991 to 2008), US (2009 to 2014), and NMG Consulting survey  (2011 to 2017).  A new household income question was introduced in the NMG survey in  2015.  Data from 2011 to 2014 surveys have been spliced on to 2015 data to produce a  consistent time series.  The diamond shows estimated share of households with  debt‑servicing ratio greater than 40% if interest rates rise by 25 basis points and  pass‑through to loan rates is full and immediate, and income is unchanged.  	 Section 2  Demand	 21 Sensitivity of companies’ profits to changes in interest  rates Mainly as a result of falls in bank debt and falls in interest  rates, the aggregate debt‑servicing ratio — the share of profits  required to meet monthly debt repayments — has also fallen  to very low levels in recent years (Chart E).  As shown by the  diamond in Chart E, a 25 basis point rise passed through fully  and immediately to all borrowing rates would increase this  metric by around 0.5 percentage points, leaving it still well  below its level in recent decades. Despite the likelihood of a more benign impact on aggregate  profitability than in the past, spending by less profitable  companies may be more sensitive to changes in interest costs.   According to 2016/17 financial accounts data, the proportion  of companies whose profit does not currently cover their  interest payments was smaller than in preceding years, and  slightly below its level in 2006 (Chart F).

In contrast, growth in employment has  remained fairly robust and the unemployment rate has fallen by more than expected.  Accordingly,  productivity growth has been weak and is expected to remain subdued.  The modest outlook for  growth in supply capacity will limit the pace at which output can grow without generating  inflationary pressure. The outlook for output growth depends on the evolution of  demand (Section 2) and the economy’s potential supply  capacity.  Faster growth in demand relative to potential supply  will erode the degree of slack in the economy and, all else  equal, eventually result in domestic inflationary pressure  (Section 4), as existing capital and labour are used more  intensively. Since the end of the financial crisis, output growth has,  unusually, been driven largely by increases in hours worked,  with little growth in productivity (Chart 3.1).  Although output  growth has been subdued in recent quarters (Section 3.1), the  increase in the total number of hours worked — in particular,  growth in the number of people in work — has largely held up  (Section 3.2).  As a result, slack in the economy appears to  have narrowed further and probably only a little remains.   The unemployment rate — an indicator of labour market  slack — fell to 4.3% in the three months to August, a little  below the MPC’s estimate of the equilibrium rate made in  February 2017.(1) As slack in the economy has been absorbed, the outlook for  output growth has become increasingly dependent on how  quickly productivity can rise.  The trend rate of productivity  growth appears to have fallen in recent years, meaning that  overall potential supply has grown more slowly than in the  past (Section 3.3).  And the effect of Brexit-related  uncertainties, including the subdued outlook for business  investment (Section 2), is likely to weigh further on  productivity growth in coming years.  As a result of that  diminished rate of supply growth, the pace at which demand  can expand before it leads to domestic inflationary pressure is  likely to be modest (Section 5).

Section 3  Output and supply	 23 3.1	 Output Having slowed somewhat in recent quarters, output growth  remained modest at 0.4% in Q3 according to the preliminary  estimate of GDP (Chart 3.2).  That was 0.1 percentage points  higher than projected three months ago.  The profile of GDP growth in recent years has been revised in  the latest data.  While on average the revisions have been  fairly small, they point to a more gradual slowing in  four‑quarter growth since 2015 than previously estimated.   Recent estimates are likely to be revised further once the ONS  receives and incorporates a fuller range of data.  The MPC’s  backcast, which takes into account information from business  surveys and the past revision properties of the official data,  points to an even more gradual slowing in growth.  The majority of the slowdown in output growth since the end  of 2016 has been accounted for by slower growth within the  service sector (Chart 3.3).  Part of that may reflect sluggish  growth in household consumption, as higher import prices  following sterling’s depreciation have weighed on households’  purchasing power (Section 2).  Having stalled in 2017 H1, manufacturing output growth  picked up sharply in Q3 (Chart 3.3).  The weakness in the  first half of the year was partly due to erratic factors.  A sharp  fall in output in the pharmaceuticals sector in Q1 unwound  unusual strength in 2016 Q4.  And a large fall in  manufacturing of transport equipment in Q2 mostly unwound  in Q3.  In contrast to the official data, survey indicators of  activity have pointed to an above-average expansion in  manufacturing output over the course of 2017, consistent with  the support to exporters from sterling’s depreciation and the  strength in global demand (Section 2). Overall output growth is projected to remain modest at  0.4% in Q4 (Chart 3.2), although there are risks around this  projection.  Survey indicators of expected activity growth  point to a range of outturns for GDP growth in Q4.  The  CBI measure points to stronger growth, while the IHS Markit/ CIPS measure fell in Q3 and points to weaker growth. 3.2	 Labour market developments In contrast to the slowdown in output growth in recent  quarters, growth in total hours worked has largely held up  (Chart 3.4).  That was mainly accounted for by growth in the  number of people in work, although growth is likely to have  slowed somewhat in Q3 (Table 3.A).  Average hours worked  per person are expected to have been broadly unchanged in  the year to Q3.  0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 2013–14 2015 2016 2017 H1 2017 Q3 Construction (6%) Manufacturing (10%) Services (79%) Percentage points + – Other production(b) (5%) Output gross value added   (GVA) growth (per cent) Chart 3.3  The slowing in output growth has been mainly  due to the service sector Contributions to average quarterly GVA growth(a) Sources:  ONS and Bank calculations.

The flows from employment to unemployment  have been at record lows in recent quarters, probably  reflecting strength in companies’ labour demand growth and a  desire to hold on to existing workers, especially in light of  subdued wage pressures (Section 4).  Relatedly, the rate of  redundancies has remained low (Table 3.B).  In addition, the  squeeze on real income (Section 2) may have encouraged  some individuals who would otherwise have left the labour  force  to stay in employment.  Indicators suggest that companies’ labour demand growth is  likely to remain relatively robust in the near term.  Most  survey measures of employment intentions are above their  historical averages (Table 3.B).  And the number of vacancies  relative to the size of the labour force — one indicator of hiring  intentions — has picked up in recent quarters and remained  elevated in Q3.  One consequence of the robust growth in employment has  been a tightening in the labour market.  Most survey measures  of recruitment difficulties have increased (Table 3.B).  And the  unemployment rate fell to 4.3% in the three months to  August (Chart 3.6).  That was lower than expected at the time  of the August Report, and a little below the MPC’s estimate of  the equilibrium unemployment rate made in February 2017.   As set out in the February Report, however, there remains  significant uncertainty around that estimate and there is a  range of views among MPC members.  The past tightening in the labour market is likely to lead to  greater upward pressure on wage growth (Section 4).  The  outlook for labour market tightness will depend not only on  companies’ demand for labour but also on developments in  labour supply.  One important determinant of labour supply is the proportion  of the population participating in the labour market, either by  working or by looking for employment.  The participation rate  has risen in recent years and was slightly higher than  anticipated in 2017 Q2, although it is expected to have fallen  back somewhat in Q3 (Chart 3.7).  The participation rate is expected to remain broadly flat in  coming years, reflecting two offsetting factors.  The rising  average age of the population is likely to weigh on aggregate  labour force participation because the participation rate of  older people tends to be lower.  But participation rates among  older people have increased steadily in recent years and this  trend is expected to continue.  In addition, as discussed above,  it is possible that the squeeze in real income following  sterling’s depreciation (Section 2) may encourage some  1995 98 2001 04 07 10 13 16 Per cent of employment Flows out of employment(b)  Flows into employment(a)  0.0 2.6 2.8 3.0 3.2 3.4 3.6 3.8 4.0 4.2 4.4 4.6 Chart 3.5  The rate at which workers are leaving  employment has fallen Flows into and out of employment Sources:  Labour Force Survey and Bank calculations.

Growth in labour supply will also be determined by population  growth.  In the MPC’s latest forecasts, population growth is  assumed to evolve in line with the ONS’s projection published  in October 2015.  In the ONS’s most recent projection,  published on 26 October 2017, the population grows a little  more slowly in coming years than previously projected.  A key influence on population growth is net migration to the  United Kingdom.  Net migration levels fell from 327,000 in  the year to 2016 Q1 to 246,000 in the year to 2017 Q1, due  mainly to a fall in net migration from the European Union  (Chart 3.8).  The ONS projects net migration to fall somewhat  further in coming years, although that path is very uncertain  and will depend on a number of factors including the  United Kingdom’s relative economic performance, the sterling  exchange rate and government policy.  Although changes in net migration affect labour supply, they  also affect domestic demand.  As a result, past shifts in net  migration do not appear to have had a significant direct  impact on slack or aggregate wage growth.(1)  But intelligence  from the Bank’s Agents suggests that, were migration to fall  abruptly, that could have more significant short-term  consequences for supply — and hence for inflationary pressure  — in some sectors that have become reliant on migrant  labour. Overall, labour market indicators point to some rebound in  employment growth in Q4, following weakness in Q3, and a  further slight fall in unemployment (Chart 3.6).  Beyond that,  labour demand and supply growth are projected to be modest,  and unemployment to be broadly flat (Section 5).   3.3	 Productivity Given the tightening in the labour market and projected  modest labour supply growth, the outlook for overall supply  growth will increasingly depend on growth in productivity.   Hourly productivity fell by 0.1% in the year to Q2 (Chart 3.9),  as output growth slowed while growth in hours worked held  up (Section 3.2).  That was weaker than expected in August, in  part due to a downward revision to four-quarter GDP growth  in the latest data (Section 3.1).  Productivity growth is  expected to pick up very gradually in the near term as any  remaining spare capacity within firms is absorbed, but to  remain weak relative to its past average.

Employment growth in the year to 2017 Q2 was  more concentrated in occupations and industries associated  with lower wages than usual (Section 4).  To the extent that  these characteristics are also associated with lower levels of  productivity, this shift in workforce composition will have  dragged on aggregate productivity growth as well as pay  growth.  But these compositional effects will only bear down  on productivity growth for as long as such shifts continue.  More broadly, productivity growth has been so weak since the  onset of the financial crisis that the level of productivity is  barely above its pre-crisis peak a decade ago (Chart 3.10).   Part of that weakness in recent years has been caused by slow  growth in the capital stock — the resources and equipment  available to produce output — relative to hours worked  (Chart 3.9).  That is the result of weak business investment  (Section 2).  In addition, the efficiency with which labour and  capital are put to use — known as total factor productivity  (TFP) — is estimated to have fallen sharply during the financial  crisis and remained subdued since then.  That weakness in  TFP growth has been a global phenomenon, perhaps in part  reflecting low diffusion of technology between the most  productive firms and the rest.(1)  The persistent weakness of  productivity growth has meant that the MPC’s forecasts for  productivity have been revised down repeatedly in recent  years.  In addition to the factors that have weighed on it since the  crisis, productivity growth is likely to be further constrained by  firms’ anticipation of and response to post-Brexit trading  arrangements.  Uncertainty around the outlook for these  arrangements is likely to weigh on investment in the capital  stock (Section 2).  Any reduction and reorientation of trade  and supply chains is also likely to weigh on TFP growth, for  example as some companies in the United Kingdom shift from  supplying customers in the European Union to those in the  rest of the world, and may result in some existing supply  capacity becoming obsolete.(2)   Taken together, these factors are consistent with productivity  growth remaining subdued in coming years.  Alongside modest  labour supply growth, that will weigh on growth in the  United Kingdom’s overall potential supply capacity, which in  turn will limit the speed at which output can grow before it  leads to domestic inflationary pressure (Section 5).

It is expected to peak at 3.2% in October, as increases in  imported costs — stemming from the past fall in sterling and a more recent pickup in global energy  prices — are passed on to consumer prices.  Inflation is then expected to fall back as past rises in  energy prices drop out of the annual comparison and as the pass-through of rises in other import  prices progresses.  Alongside that moderation in external pressures, however, domestic inflationary  pressures are likely to build to more normal levels. 4.1	 Consumer price developments and the  near-term outlook CPI inflation increased to 3.0% in September from 2.6% in  June, slightly above the 2.8% projected at the time of the  August Report (Chart 4.1).  That upside news reflected  larger-than-expected contributions from clothing and  footwear prices and retail fuel. The increase in inflation to above the MPC’s 2% target over  the past year reflects the effects of the continued rise in  import prices following sterling’s depreciation (Section 4.2).   Over this period, inflation has picked up most in those  components that tend to have the greatest imported content,  such as food, energy and other goods (Chart 4.2).  The rise in  global oil prices in recent months has added somewhat to  external cost pressures and is likely to feed through to retail  fuel prices, and therefore to CPI inflation, relatively quickly. Inflation is likely to rise further in the near term, peaking at  3.2% in October (Chart 4.1), before starting to fall back.  The  pace and extent of that fall will depend in part on the path for  external and domestic cost pressures facing companies.   Although the positive contribution of higher retail fuel prices is  expected largely to have dissipated by the end of the year, the  effect of the past fall in sterling on non-energy imported cost  growth is expected to diminish only gradually (Section 4.2).   Alongside that, domestic inflationary pressures are likely to  build to more normal levels in coming years (Section 4.3).  In  particular, unit labour cost growth is expected to be supported  by a gradual rise in wage growth in response to the tightening  in labour market conditions.  Inflation expectations remain  consistent with inflation returning to the target in the medium  term (Section 4.4). 1 0 1 2 3 4 Jan. July Jan. July Jan. July Jan. July Jan.

That, in turn, has  largely reflected the depreciation of sterling, which, since the  EU referendum, has remained 15%–20% below its peak in  November 2015 (Section 1).  The prices of some global  commodities, such as oil and metals, have also picked up in  recent months.  Energy US dollar oil prices have risen since the August Report  (Chart 4.3).  Some of that rise is likely to have reflected  stronger global demand (Section 1).  Market contacts report  that the disruption to supply from recent events, such as the  Atlantic hurricane season, has also pushed up oil prices, as has  the continued implementation of the November 2016  agreement between some oil producers to curb production  over 2017.  The cost of oil accounts for around one third of the cost of  retail fuel and tends to be passed on to fuel prices relatively  quickly.  The rise in global prices means that, in the run-up to  the November Report, the price of oil was 17% higher in  sterling terms than at the time of the August Report  (Chart 4.4).  The contribution of fuel prices to CPI inflation  picked up in September (Section 4.1) and is expected to  remain higher in the near term than was projected in August. Although the spot price of oil has increased, the oil futures  curve, on which the MPC’s forecasts are conditioned, has  moved by less and is now downward sloping (Chart 4.4).  As a  result, the contribution of fuel prices to overall inflation is  expected to be more negative from 2018 H2 than projected in  August (Section 5).   UK wholesale gas prices also tend to be influenced by changes  in global oil prices.  Consequently, sterling wholesale gas prices  have risen since August, with the sterling gas futures curve, on  which the MPC’s projections are conditioned, around 5%  higher (Chart 4.4).  The pass-through of wholesale gas prices  to retail prices tends to take much longer than for changes in  oil prices and the degree of pass-through varies over time.  In  the near term, rises in retail electricity and gas prices by the  major providers earlier in the year will continue to boost the  contribution of utility prices to inflation until they drop out of  the annual comparison in the first half of 2018 (Table 4.A).  0 20 40 60 80 100 120 2014 15 16 17 Indices:  2014 = 100 Industrial metals prices(a)   Agricultural prices(a)(b)    Oil price(c)   August Report    Chart 4.3  Oil and metals prices have increased since the  August Report US dollar oil and commodity prices Sources:  Bloomberg, S&P indices, Thomson Reuters Datastream and Bank calculations.

Section 4  Costs and prices	 29 Non-energy imported costs Most of the increase in inflation over the past year has been  driven by an increase in the cost of non-energy imports facing  UK companies.  Sterling non-energy import prices increased by  10% between 2015 Q4 and 2017 Q2, and are expected to rise  further over 2018.  By far the biggest driver of the rise in  import prices has been the depreciation of sterling over this  period (Chart 4.5).  World export prices — the foreign  currency prices companies in other countries charge for their  exports, weighted according to countries’ shares in UK imports  — have also increased recently, with annual growth of 3% in  Q2.  In part, that reflects the recent pickup in oil and other  commodity prices (Chart 4.3), which are inputs into the  production of many other goods. The pickup in import prices since the end of 2015 has been  substantial, but to date it remains less than the average  response to similarly sized falls in sterling over the past.  As  explained in the box on pages 28–29 of the November 2015  Report, Bank staff estimated that, on average, 60% of changes  in the sterling value of world export prices tend to be reflected  in UK import prices, with that pass-through taking around a  year.  As of 2017 Q2, only around 50% of the increase in world  export prices in sterling terms has been reflected in higher  import prices.  While this could suggest the overall rise in import prices will  be more limited than in the past, there are reasons why  pass-through to import prices is likely to be slower on this  occasion.  For example, elevated uncertainty before the  referendum may have encouraged UK importers and foreign  exporters to the United Kingdom to hedge their sterling  exposures for longer periods than usual.  That would delay the  pace at which the fall in sterling is passed on to UK companies’  input costs.  Volatility in sterling may also have led foreign  exporters to delay or moderate adjustments to their prices  until they were more certain of the appropriate level.  As a  result, the past depreciation in sterling is projected to continue  pushing up import prices in coming quarters.  Survey measures  of input cost growth remain consistent with that continued  pass-through (Chart 4.5). Import price pass-through to consumer prices  A natural consequence of the pass-through of rising import  prices to consumer prices is an initial compression and then a  gradual rebuild in the domestic profit margins on consumer  goods and services.  One measure of these margins — the  difference between estimated costs, including import and  labour costs, and consumer price inflation — suggests profit  margins have narrowed since 2016 H1 as imported costs have  increased (Charts 4.6 and 4.7).  15 10 5 0 5 10 15 2005 08 11 14 17 Percentage changes on a year earlier Percentage changes on a year earlier Import prices(b) Range of input cost indicators(a) 10 0 10 20 30 2005 08 11 14 17 Foreign export prices in   foreign currency(c) Foreign export prices in   sterling terms(d) Import prices(b) + – + – Chart 4.5  Import prices have continued to rise Import prices, foreign export prices and indicators of input cost  pressures Sources:  Bank of England, BCC, CBI, CEIC, Eurostat, IHS Markit, ONS, Thomson Reuters Datastream and Bank calculations.

Table 4.A  Monitoring the MPC’s key judgements  30	 Inflation Report  November 2017 There is some uncertainty around estimates of profit margins,  but a number of indicators point to a compression in  consumer margins relative to those in the broader economy.   That is consistent with exporters’ profits having been boosted  by the fall in sterling’s exchange rate (Section 2).(1)  Estimates  derived from firms’ financial accounts suggest that, while the  operating margins of UK-focused firms in the FTSE All‑Share  index have narrowed since 2016, those of other companies in  the index have not.(2)  And survey indicators of profitability —  such as the EEF measure — and intelligence from the Bank’s  Agents suggest that margins on domestic sales have been  lower than those on exports over the recent past. The pass-through of higher import prices, as companies try to  restore their margins on consumer goods and services, has  been the key driver of higher CPI inflation over the past year.   It is likely to continue to push up inflation for several years as  import costs continue to rise and as those margins are rebuilt.   The precise impact on inflation will, however, depend on the  speed at which companies rebuild their margins and the extent  to which they do so by raising output prices or reducing other  costs.  Over the past, changes in import prices have tended to  be passed on to consumer prices in aggregate broadly in line  with the share of imported inputs in the CPI basket — around  30%.  That tends to take place gradually, with annual inflation  affected for around four years after the change in import  prices.(3) There is evidence that the pass-through of import prices to  consumer prices is occurring more rapidly than on average in  the past, which will have supported profit margins.  As a result,  although the response of import prices to the depreciation in  sterling has been less than on average over the past, the CPI  has risen by a little more than its average response.  Moreover,  inflation among import-intensive components of the CPI —  those components that are imported or have a high share of  imported inputs, such as food — has picked up particularly  sharply (Chart 4.8).  There are signs that cost pressures further  back in the supply chain have moderated, in part as the fall in  sterling is passed on, though indicators of companies’  expected output prices — which capture the price of  intermediate inputs into consumer goods and services —  remain elevated. 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 1998 2001 04 07 10 13 16 Percentage point deviation from 1998–2007 average + – Chart 4.7  Consumer profit margins have narrowed since  2016 H1 Estimated margins on consumer goods and services(a) Sources:  OBR, ONS and Bank calculations.

Section 4  Costs and prices	 31 4.3	 Domestic cost pressures While external cost pressures are set to wane over the next  couple of years, the absorption of slack in the domestic  economy (Section 3) means that domestic cost pressures are  likely to build to more normal levels.  The largest domestic cost facing most companies is the cost of  labour.  The degree to which those costs affect inflation will  depend on growth in unit labour costs (ULCs) — the labour  costs associated with producing a unit of output.  ULC growth  will reflect wage growth, alongside growth in the other labour  costs facing companies, and how both of those evolve relative  to growth in productivity. Despite the continued fall in unemployment (Section 3), pay  growth remains subdued.  In the past, lower unemployment  has typically been associated with higher pay growth  (Chart 4.9), as it becomes more difficult for companies to  recruit and retain employees.(1)  Average weekly earnings  (AWE) pay growth increased only a little in the three months  to August, however, with annual growth in regular pay,  excluding bonuses, at 2.3% in the private sector and 2.1%  across the whole economy (Table 4.B).  Pay growth for those  on lower wages appears to have been somewhat higher in the  year to 2017 Q2, according to the latest Annual Survey of  Hours and Earnings, probably reflecting the effects of the  National Living Wage. Much of the weakness in pay growth in recent years will have  reflected weak productivity growth (Section 3), reducing the  drag on companies’ cost pressures.  Consistent with that, ULC  growth (Chart 4.10) has been much less subdued than wage  growth, relative to their past averages.  Recent upward  revisions by the ONS to the size of companies’ pension  contributions as well as downward revisions to productivity  growth (Section 3) mean that ULC growth is now estimated to  have been higher over the past few quarters than at the time  of the August Report.  One specific factor that may have weighed on both wage and  productivity growth in recent quarters — and so limited the  impact of weak wage growth on domestic cost pressures — is  changes in the composition of the workforce.(2)  Bank staff  estimate that the growth in employment in the four quarters  to 2017 Q2 has been disproportionately in occupations and  industries typically associated with lower wages.

This recent shift in the composition of labour is estimated to  account for around 0.7 percentage points of the weakness in  pay growth in Q2 (Chart 4.11), although there is considerable  uncertainty around this estimate.  To the extent that the  impact on pay growth of those compositional effects reflects a  relatively lower level of productivity, measured productivity  growth would be expected to be commensurately lower  (Section 3).  As a result, ULC growth, and hence domestic  labour cost pressures, will have been much less affected.  Wage growth is projected to increase gradually over 2018, as  the tightening labour market starts to put more widespread  upward pressure on wage demands and as productivity growth  recovers somewhat.  Although most survey indicators suggest  that wage growth is likely to remain modest in the near term,  there are some signs that wage demand pressures have  increased.  Churn in the labour market has remained robust  over recent quarters, with the proportion of people moving  from one job to another close to its pre-crisis rate  (Chart 4.12).  That could suggest continued confidence among  employees in their labour market prospects, which may place  pressure on businesses to retain staff by increasing wages.   Consistent with that, the REC survey continues to suggest  wage growth has risen for new recruits (Table 4.B).  And the  Bank’s Agents also report a greater willingness among  companies to increase pay growth, relative to earlier in the  year, particularly for new recruits and key staff.  Perhaps acting  against that, another factor that may have been influencing  pay decisions recently is companies’ uncertainty around the  economic outlook.  This could affect their willingness to raise  pay at a faster pace until they have more clarity about future  demand for their output. ULC growth is expected to have slowed in Q3 (Chart 4.10),  reflecting the effect of higher pension contributions in  2016 H2 starting to drop out of the annual comparison and  reducing the contribution from non-wage costs.  Further  ahead, the gradual recovery in pay growth, alongside an  increase in non-wage costs — as the phasing in of automatic  enrolment in workplace pension schemes continues — and  continued weak productivity growth, means that ULC growth  is projected to rise from mid-2018 (Section 5). 4.4	 Inflation expectations Inflation expectations may influence wage and price-setting  behaviour.  For example, if companies and households become  less confident that inflation will return to the MPC’s 2%  target, that may lead to changes in wage and price-setting  that make inflation persist above the target for longer.  4 2 0 2 4 6 8 10 2005 07 09 11 13 15 17 Productivity Non-wage labour costs per head Wages, salaries and self-employment   income per head(b)  Unit labour cost growth (per cent) Percentage points + – Chart 4.10  Unit labour cost growth has been less subdued than  wage growth Decomposition of four-quarter whole-economy unit labour cost growth(a) (a)	 Whole-economy labour costs divided by real GDP, based on the backcast of the final estimate of GDP.

Section 4  Costs and prices	 33 The MPC monitors a range of indicators — derived from  financial market prices and surveys of households and  companies — to assess whether inflation expectations remain  consistent with its target.  Most of these indicators suggest  that inflation expectations were broadly unchanged in the  latest data (Table 4.C) and were consistent with a return to  the target over coming years.  Indicators of long-term inflation  expectations remain around their past averages.  And  indicators of shorter-term inflation expectations — which tend  to respond more to changes in actual inflation and the  near-term outlook — have also been broadly stable, despite  the recent further pickup in CPI inflation. Overall, the MPC judges that inflation expectations remain  well anchored, and that indicators of medium-term inflation  expectations continue to be broadly consistent with a return  of inflation to the 2% target.

Unemployment has continued to fall and the extent of spare  capacity in the economy now seems limited.  Moreover, the pace at which the economy can grow  without generating inflationary pressure has fallen over recent years.  Over the MPC’s forecast  period, conditioned on a path for Bank Rate that rises to 1% by the end of 2020, demand is  projected to grow at a pace that uses up the remaining slack in the economy.  As imported  inflationary pressures wane, domestic pressures build.  Inflation is projected to remain slightly  above the 2% target at the three-year point.  At its meeting ending on 1 November 2017, the MPC  voted to increase Bank Rate to 0.5%.    Growth over the past year has been supported by resilient  consumer confidence (Chart 1.2), the stronger world economy  (Chart 1.1), the small loosening in fiscal policy relative to  previous plans and the MPC’s comprehensive package of  measures in August 2016.  Credit conditions facing  UK households (Chart 1.14) and companies (Chart 1.11) have  eased further, and exporters have also benefited from a lower  level of sterling.  Unemployment has fallen to a 42-year low  and the level of remaining slack is limited.  CPI inflation has  risen above the MPC’s 2% target as expected, as the sharp fall  in sterling has begun to pass through into consumer prices. Over the past few months, market expectations for the path  of Bank Rate have risen.  The MPC’s projections, summarised  in Table 5.A, are conditioned on a path that implies a gradual  rise in Bank Rate to 1.0% by the end of 2020, and is around  ¼ percentage point higher than that in the August 2017  Report (Table 5.B).(1)  The exchange rate has been volatile but  starts the projection at a similar level to August.  Overall,  there is a little less monetary stimulus in these projections  than assumed in August. The 18% decline in sterling since late 2015 largely reflects  financial market participants’ judgements about the impact of  Brexit on the United Kingdom.  Those judgements depend on  assumptions about the United Kingdom’s trading relationships  after Brexit and about the transition to those arrangements.  (1)	 Unless otherwise stated, the projections shown in this section are conditioned on:   Bank Rate following a path implied by market yields;  the stock of purchased gilts  remaining at £435 billion and the stock of purchased corporate bonds remaining at  £10 billion throughout the forecast period and the Term Funding Scheme (TFS), all  three of which are financed by the issuance of central bank reserves;  the  Recommendations of the Financial Policy Committee and the current regulatory plans  of the Prudential Regulation Authority;  the Government’s tax and spending plans as  set out in the 2017 March Budget;  commodity prices following market paths;  and the  sterling exchange rate remaining broadly flat.  The main assumptions are set out in a  table at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/inflationreport/2017/ novca.pdf.

Section 5  Prospects for inflation	 35 As in previous Reports, the MPC’s projections are conditioned  on the average of a range of possible outcomes for the  United Kingdom’s trading relationship with the European  Union.  They also assume that households and companies base  their decisions on the expectation of a smooth adjustment to  those new trading arrangements. The outlook for UK growth is set against a backdrop of strong  global growth (Key Judgement 1), with recent data pointing to  more momentum than had been projected in August.  That  strength, along with the lower sterling exchange rate, supports  UK trade (Key Judgement 2).  Business investment is projected  to grow at a moderate pace but by less than would have been  suggested by global demand and financial conditions alone, as  uncertainty around Brexit weighs on companies’ plans.   Household spending growth has slowed as higher import costs  have squeezed real incomes.  Real income and spending  growth are projected to recover gradually as nominal pay  growth picks up and imported inflation falls back.  Overall,  demand growth is projected to remain modest over the  forecast period (Chart 5.1).   The pace at which the economy can grow without generating  inflationary pressure has fallen relative to pre-crisis norms.   This reflects persistent weakness in productivity growth and,  more recently, the more limited availability of labour.  That  means modest demand growth uses up the little spare  capacity remaining in the economy over the forecast period  (Key Judgement 3).  As a result, domestic inflationary  pressures are judged likely to build as the boost from imported  inflation diminishes (Key Judgement 4).  Inflation is projected  to peak at around 3¼% in October, a bit higher than expected  three months ago (Chart 5.3), before falling back to end the  forecast period slightly above the 2% target (Chart 5.2). At its meeting ending on 1 November 2017, the MPC voted to  increase Bank Rate to 0.5%, to maintain the stock of sterling  non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases,  financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at £10 billion  and to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases,  financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £435 billion.  The factors behind that decision are set out in  the Monetary Policy Summary on pages i–ii of this Report, and  in more detail in the Minutes of the meeting.(1)  The remainder  of this section sets out the MPC’s projections, and the risks  around them, in more detail.    5.1	 The MPC’s key judgements and risks Key Judgement 1:  global growth remains strong Global growth has picked up significantly over the past year  across advanced and emerging economies.

It has been  conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.A footnote (b).  To the left of the vertical dashed line,  the distribution reflects the likelihood of revisions to the data over the past;  to the right, it  reflects uncertainty over the evolution of GDP growth in the future.  If economic circumstances  identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that  the mature estimate of GDP growth would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of  those occasions.  The fan chart is constructed so that outturns are also expected to lie within  each pair of the lighter green areas on 30 occasions.  In any particular quarter of the forecast  period, GDP growth is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fan on 90 out of  100 occasions.  And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions GDP growth can fall anywhere  outside the green area of the fan chart.  Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the  light grey background.  See the box on page 39 of the November 2007 Inflation Report for a  fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.  36	 Inflation Report  November 2017 strengthening indicators of global investment, such as capital  goods orders, suggest that growth is becoming more broadly  based.   The pickup has been particularly marked in the euro area  (Section 1), where considerable spare capacity had built up  earlier this decade.  Monetary stimulus, together with  improving credit conditions and confidence, has led output to  grow above its potential rate and some of that slack to be  absorbed.  The outlook for growth depends in part on how  much slack is left. Unemployment has fallen significantly from its peaks in all  euro-area countries but remains above pre-crisis rates in most.      Recent outturns for wages show less upward pressure on pay  from those falls in unemployment than might have been  expected, suggesting that the equilibrium unemployment rate  may have fallen.  In part, that is likely to reflect structural  reforms to labour markets in several countries.  Given that,  together with evidence on broader indicators of labour market  conditions, the MPC judges that there is still significant slack  to be absorbed in the euro area.  That means that growth can  continue at around current rates in the near term, before  falling back towards potential further out, a higher projection  than that of three months ago (Chart 5.4). Recent data also point to slightly stronger US GDP growth in  the near term than previously expected (Section 1).  Growth is  projected to slow to around its potential rate over the forecast  period (Table 5.C).  Elsewhere in the world, there has been  little news to change the MPC’s projections.  In China, growth  is still projected to slow towards 6% over the next three years.    Alongside this, credit is expected to continue to grow at a  rapid pace and significant risks to financial stability are  expected to remain.

Based on PPP weights, global activity is projected to expand at  3¾% in 2018 before slowing a touch to 3½% (Table 5.C).   Weighted by UK export shares, growth is around 2¾%,  slowing to 2¼% by 2020.  That is a slightly higher projection  than three months ago, reflecting the stronger outlooks for  the euro area and United States.  The risks around the  projection are judged to be balanced.    Key Judgement 2:  investment and net trade support  UK demand, while consumption growth remains subdued   UK growth has been modest in recent quarters and its  composition has rotated towards net trade and business  investment and away from consumption (Section 2).  That  pattern continues over the forecast period as households  continue to adjust to lower levels of real income.  The combination of the stronger global economy and the  lower sterling exchange rate is supporting UK exports.  Given  weaker domestic demand, imports have grown more  sluggishly than exports and net trade has supported  UK growth over the past year.  Over much of the forecast  period, that support continues, consistent with the strength in  world demand relative to that in the United Kingdom and the  lower exchange rate.  As in previous Reports, both exports and  imports grow relatively slowly compared with their historical  relationships with demand and the exchange rate, as  companies here and abroad begin to adjust trading  relationships in light of the United Kingdom’s vote to  withdraw from the European Union (Table 5.D).  The latest data show somewhat stronger UK business  investment growth over the past year than previously  estimated.  Over the recent past and during the forecast  period, business investment is supported by external demand,  the limited spare capacity in firms and the continuing low cost  of finance (the box on pages 18–21 discusses the sensitivity of  companies to higher interest rates).  Investment growth is,  however, more modest than would have been expected given  these conditions alone — probably as a result of the drag on  companies’ investment plans from the anticipation of and  uncertainty around Brexit, as suggested by a range of survey  evidence and contacts of the Bank’s Agents.  Overall, business  investment is projected to grow at a little above current rates  (Table 5.D) and to end the forecast well below levels  projected prior to the referendum. Households’ spending depends on their incomes and also on  their decisions on saving and borrowing.  Household real  income growth has slowed sharply over the past year largely  as a result of the increase in inflation associated with sterling’s  depreciation (Key Judgement 4).  Aggregating across all  households, income growth has been supported by solid  Table 5.C  MPC key judgements(a)(b) Key Judgement 1:  global growth remains strong 	 Average	 	               Projections 	 1998– 	 2007	 2017	 2018	 2019	 2020 World GDP (UK-weighted)(c) 	 3	 2¾ (2½)	 2¾ (2½)	 2½ (2½)	 2¼ World GDP (PPP-weighted)(d)	 4	 3½ (3½)	 3¾ (3½)	 3½ (3½)	 3½ Euro-area GDP(e)	 2¼	 2¼ (2¼)	 2¼ (2)	 2 (1¾)	 1¾ US GDP(f)	 3	 2¼ (2)	 2¼ (2)	 2 (2¼)	 1¾ Key Judgement 2:  investment and net trade support UK demand, while consumption  growth remains subdued 	 Average	 	               Projections 	 1998– 	 2007	 2017	 2018	 2019	 2020 Business investment to   GDP ratio(g)	 9¾	 9½ (9¼)	 9½ (9½)	 9½ (9½)	 9¾ Credit spreads(h)	 ¾(i)	 1¾ (1¾)	 1¾ (1¾)	 1¾ (1¾)	 2 Household saving ratio(j)	 8½	 5¼ (3)	 5¼ (3)	 4¾ (2¾)	 4¾ Key Judgement 3:  with little slack remaining and diminished growth in potential  supply, modest demand growth is sufficient to restore domestic inflationary pressure 	 Average	 	               Projections 	 1998– 	 2007	 2017	 2018	 2019	 2020 Productivity(k)	 2¼	 ¼ (½)	 1¼ (1½)	 1½ (1½)	 1¼ Participation rate(l)	 63	 63½ (63½)	 63½ (63½)	 63½ (63¾)	 63¾ Average hours(m)	 32¼	 32¼ (32)	 32 (32)	 31¾ (31¾)	 31¾ Key Judgement 4:  significant upward pressure on inflation from import and energy  prices eases over the forecast period and domestic inflationary pressures build 	 Average	 	               Projections 	 1998– 	 2007	 2017	 2018	 2019	 2020 UK import prices(n)	 ¼	 2½ (2)	 1¾ (2)	 ½ (¾)	 ½ Dollar oil prices(o)	 39	 57 (49)	 56 (51)	 55 (53)	 55 Unit labour costs(p)	 3	 1¾ (1¼)	 2 (1¾)	 2¼ (2¼)	 2¼ Sources:  Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research (used with permission), Bank of England,  BDRC Continental SME Finance Monitor, Bloomberg, British Household Panel Survey, Department for Business,  Energy and Industrial Strategy, Eurostat, IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO), ONS, US Bureau of Economic  Analysis and Bank calculations.

Over the forecast period, real wage  growth rises gradually as nominal pay growth picks up and  imported inflation falls back (Key Judgement 4), although  there is less support to aggregate income from employment  growth.   Changes in interest rates affect both current incomes and the  incentive to spend today rather than in the future.  The MPC’s  November projection is conditioned on a path for Bank Rate  that rises to around 1% in three years’ time.  Higher interest  rates raise interest income for those with deposits and raise  interest payments for those with loans.  As set out in the box  on pages 18–21, although there is uncertainty about the  impact of higher rates, there is little reason to expect the  impact of a rate rise to be greater than in the past.  Household  debt to income has fallen back from its 2008 peak, while  deposits have risen relative to income.  Around 60% of the  stock of mortgages is at fixed rates, a higher proportion than  when interest rates were raised in the past.  People holding  those mortgages will only face changes in their interest  payments when the fixed term of their deal ends.  Moreover,  past falls in credit spreads (Section 1) mean that current  fixed‑rate deals are lower than those prevailing two to five  years ago.  Someone moving from an expiring five-year deal to  a new one could see rates fall by roughly 200 basis points and  for two-year deals the fall in rates could be around  30 basis points.  Evidence from the latest NMG survey  suggests that the proportion of households with particularly  high debt‑servicing ratios, who might be more likely to cut  spending markedly in the face of an income shock, remains  well below pre-crisis average levels.  It would probably take a  further rise of around 1½ percentage points in interest rates  before this proportion returned to its pre-crisis average of 2%,  even assuming no rise in nominal incomes.   Consumption growth has slowed over the past year as  households have begun to adjust spending to the lower level  of income implied by the fall in sterling.  Annual consumption  growth is projected to slow a little further next year, as  households continue to adjust to past falls in real wages, with  annual growth then rising back to 1½% by the end of the  forecast period (Table 5.D).  In the central projection, the  saving ratio is broadly flat (Chart 5.5) and consumer credit  growth continues to slow from current high rates.  It is  possible that households will want to maintain a higher rate of  spending in the near term despite weakness in their income,  implying a declining saving ratio.  In the other direction,  households could increase saving or cut back borrowing if, for  example, they were to become more pessimistic or uncertain  about their income prospects.   The housing market is also sensitive to households’ views of  their income prospects and the path of interest rates.  House  price inflation has slowed over the past year, but recent  outturns have been a little above expectations three months  Table 5.D  Indicative projections consistent with the MPC’s modal  projections(a) 	 Average	 	               Projections 	 1998– 	 2007	 2017	 2018	 2019	 2020 Household consumption(b)	 3½	 1½ (1¾)	 1 (¾)	 1¼ (1¼)	 1½ Business investment(c)	 1¾	 2½ (1)	 2¾ (2¾)	 3 (3½)	 3 Housing investment(d)	 3¼	 4 (2¾)	 1¼ (1¾)	 ¼ (1)	 ½ Exports(e)	 4½	 4¾ (3½)	 2 (2¼)	 1¼ (1¼)	 ½ Imports(e)	 6	 3 (3¼)	 ¼ (½)	 -¼ (0)	 -¼ Real post-tax household income(f)	 3¼	 -½ (-½)	 1 (¾)	 ¾ (1)	 1½ Employment(g)	 1	 1 (1)	 ¾ (½)	 ½ (¾)	 ¾ Average weekly earnings(h)	 4¼	 2¼ (2)	 3 (3)	 3¼ (3¼)	 3¼ (a)	 These projections are produced by Bank staff for the MPC to be consistent with the MPC’s modal  projections for GDP growth, CPI inflation and unemployment.

Over the forecast period, house prices are projected to  continue to grow around current rates (Table 5.E).  Housing  investment growth, which has been supported recently by  unusually strong housebuilding activity, is projected to slow  over 2018, as in August (Table 5.D).    Key Judgement 3:  with little slack remaining and  diminished growth in potential supply, modest demand  growth is sufficient to restore domestic inflationary  pressure The economy can only grow so fast without putting upward  pressure on inflation.  That potential rate of growth will vary  over time.  Since the financial crisis, the United Kingdom has  had significant spare capacity.  That meant the economy could  grow at a fairly rapid pace without putting significant upward  pressure on inflation, as it did in 2014–15.  As that spare  capacity is used up, however, growth at above potential rates  is likely to lead to more material upward pressure on inflation.   Table 5.E  Monitoring risks to the Committee’s key judgements The Committee’s projections are underpinned by four key  judgements.  Risks surround all of these, and the MPC will  monitor a broad range of variables to assess the degree to  which the risks are crystallising.  The table below shows  Bank staff’s indicative near-term projections that are  consistent with the judgements in the MPC’s central view  evolving as expected. Key judgement Likely developments in 2017 Q4 to 2018 Q2 if judgements evolve as expected 1:  global growth remains  strong • Quarterly euro-area GDP growth to average a little above ½%. • Quarterly US GDP growth to average a little above ½%. • Indicators of activity consistent with four-quarter PPP-weighted emerging market economy growth of  around 4¾%;  within that, GDP growth in China to average a little above 6½%. 2:  investment and net  trade support UK demand,  while consumption growth  remains subdued  • Quarterly growth in UK business investment to average ¾%. • Net trade to provide a small boost to quarterly UK GDP growth, on average. • Real post-tax household income to increase slightly in the first half of 2018. • Quarterly consumption growth to average ¼%. • Household debt to income ratio, excluding student loans, to be broadly flat. • Credit spreads to be broadly flat. • Mortgage approvals for house purchase to average around 68,000 per month. • The average of the Halifax/Markit and Nationwide house price indices to increase by just under  ¾% per quarter, on average. • After picking up in Q3, quarterly housing investment growth to average just over ¼%. 3:  with little slack  remaining and diminished  growth in potential supply,  modest demand growth is  sufficient to restore  domestic inflationary  pressure  • Unemployment rate to remain around its current level of 4¼%. • Participation rate to remain around its current level of 63½%. • Average weekly hours worked to be broadly flat at just over 32. • Quarterly hourly labour productivity growth to average just under ½% in 2018 H1. 4:  significant upward  pressure on inflation from  import and energy prices  eases over the forecast  period and domestic  inflationary pressures build  • Four-quarter growth in AWE regular pay to be around 2½% in 2018 H1. • Four-quarter growth in whole-economy unit labour costs to average around 1¾%. • Non-fuel import prices to rise by 1¾% in the year to 2018 Q2. • Electricity and gas prices to be flat during 2018 H1. • Commodity prices and sterling ERI to evolve in line with the conditioning assumptions set out in  www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/inflationreport/2017/novca.pdf. • Indicators of medium-term inflation expectations to continue to be broadly consistent with the 2% target.  40	 Inflation Report  November 2017 Moreover, that potential rate now seems lower than in the  past, reducing the speed at which demand can grow  sustainably.   An important indicator of labour market slack is the  unemployment rate, which peaked at over 8% in 2011.  It has  since fallen back to 4.3%, its lowest rate in 42 years and below  the MPC’s estimated equilibrium unemployment rate of  around 4½%.  As set out in a box in the February 2017 Report,  there remains considerable uncertainty around this estimate.   Developments in output and inflation suggest that there may  be a little spare capacity in the economy.  Taking all the  evidence together, the MPC judges that the output gap  narrowed over 2017, and by more than expected three months  ago. With little slack remaining, the speed at which the economy  can grow will depend on the pace at which its supply capacity  expands.  During the economic recovery, potential supply  growth was driven to an unusual extent by potential labour  supply rather than potential productivity.  Growth in potential  labour supply reflected falling equilibrium unemployment and  high net inward migration flows (Section 3).  More recently  potential labour supply growth has eased, and is projected to  remain stable over the forecast period, based on ONS  projections for population growth, which incorporate a further  fall in net inward migration flows (Section 3).  That means  supply growth will be more reliant on productivity growth.    Productivity has barely grown over the past ten years,  compared with growth rates of around 2¼% a year on average  before then.  The weakness in recent years in part reflects low  levels of investment and the resulting low growth in the  capital stock.  It also reflects unusually weak growth in total  factor productivity (TFP), the efficiency with which companies  use their resources to produce output.  The MPC, like other  forecasters, has repeatedly marked down its projected  recovery in productivity growth over recent years.  Firms’ anticipation of and response to post-Brexit trading  relationships are also likely to weigh on productivity growth.   Uncertainty is probably holding back investment  (Key Judgement 2).  A need to reorientate production and  supply chains would be likely to weigh on TFP growth, as  would a reduction in openness.  Taking all influences together,  potential productivity is projected to grow at around 1% a  year.  Measured hourly productivity growth has been very  weak in recent quarters.  It is projected to pick up above  potential as that weakness unwinds, before falling back  (Chart 5.6) towards its estimated trend rate. The MPC judges that UK potential supply growth is likely to  remain modest over the forecast period at around 1½%.   With little spare capacity at the start of the forecast period,  that means that demand can grow only at a modest pace if  Projection at the time of the August Report  Projection consistent with MPC   key judgements in November  + – 2  1  0  1  2  3  4  Percentage change on previous year  1998 2000  04  06  10  12  16  08  20 02 14 18 Chart 5.6  Productivity(a)   Sources:  ONS and Bank calculations.

Projections were only available to 2019 at the  time of the August Report.  	 Section 5  Prospects for inflation	 41 inflation is to return sustainably to the 2% target  (Key Judgement 4).  Conditioned on market interest rates, any  remaining slack is judged likely to be used up by the end of the  forecast period.   Key Judgement 4:  significant upward pressure on inflation  from import and energy prices eases over the forecast  period and domestic inflationary pressures build Inflation has risen to 3% and is projected to peak at around  3¼% in October.  Inflation has been above the MPC’s 2%  target since the start of 2017, reflecting upward pressure from  the depreciation of sterling and higher energy prices.  The  speed at which inflation returns to the 2% target will depend  both on how quickly those upward pressures diminish and on  the extent of domestic inflationary pressures.   The sterling ERI remains 18% below its late-2015 peak.  That  lower level of sterling has already led to a sharp rise in import  prices, with somewhat more to come through over the  forecast period (Chart 5.7).  The rise in imported costs initially  squeezes profit margins for companies in UK consumer supply  chains (Section 4).  That squeeze will unwind as companies  pass on higher costs into their prices, but that process is likely  to take several years to complete. As companies have begun to pass on their higher costs, the  contribution of import prices to CPI inflation has risen sharply,  to nearly 1 percentage point.  That contribution is expected to  remain elevated in coming quarters before beginning to fall  back in the second half of the forecast period.  Below-average  contributions from petrol and domestic energy prices are also  projected to reduce inflation over the next 18 months or so.   The period of above-target inflation could be more persistent  if it leads households and companies to revise up their  expectations for inflation, and that feeds through to wage and  price-setting decisions.  Indicators of medium-term inflation  expectations, however, remain consistent with the 2% target  (Section 4).   The rise in external cost pressures has come against a  backdrop of modest wage growth, even as the labour market  has tightened.  That in part reflects the low rate of  productivity growth.  The rise in productivity growth over the  forecast period should feed through to higher pay growth, but  both productivity and wage growth are likely to settle at lower  rates than typically seen before the crisis.   There are some tentative signs of wage growth picking up,  especially for new recruits (Section 4).  With labour market  churn back to pre-crisis levels, that should feed through into  higher average pay growth over time.  But there is still  uncertainty about how responsive pay will be to an  increasingly tight labour market.  It is possible, for example,  that pressure in the labour market at a time of above-target  Table 5.F  Calendar-year GDP growth rates of the modal, median  and mean paths(a)  	 	 Mode	 	 Median	 	 Mean 2017(b)	 1.6	 (1.7)	 1.6	 (1.7)	 1.6	 (1.7) 2018	 1.6	 (1.6)	 1.6	 (1.6)	 1.6	 (1.6) 2019	 1.7	 (1.8)	 1.7	 (1.7)	 1.7	 (1.7) 2020	 1.7	 	 1.7	 	 1.7 (a)	 The table shows the projections for calendar-year growth of real GDP consistent with the modal, median  and mean projections for four-quarter growth of real GDP implied by the fan chart.

In the other direction, uncertainty about the  outlook for demand and profitability could weigh on  companies’ pay decisions or workers’ willingness to search for  a new role.   Inflationary pressure depends on changes in wages, and other  labour costs such as pension contributions, relative to  productivity.  Developments in unit labour costs have been  more consistent with a tightening labour market.  Unit labour  costs have been growing at close to past average rates,  although that in part reflects a temporary boost from  non‑labour costs, which has begun to unwind (Section 4).  As  pressure on supply builds, unit labour cost growth is likely to  pick up again.   Conditional on market interest rate expectations, which  anticipate two additional rises in Bank Rate over the  three‑year forecast period, the MPC judges that wage and unit  labour cost growth are likely to rise over the forecast period  (Tables 5.D and 5.C).  In the central projection, CPI inflation is  judged likely to still be slightly above the 2% target at the  three-year forecast horizon. 5.2	 The projections for demand,  unemployment and inflation Based on the judgements above and the risks around them,  under the market path for Bank Rate and the assumption of an  unchanged stock of purchased assets, the MPC projects  four-quarter GDP growth to pick up from early next year and  settle around 1¾%.  In the second half of 2017, quarterly GDP  growth is projected to be a little stronger than expected in  August, but 2017 calendar-year growth is just below the  August projection (Table 5.F) due to revisions to 2016 data.  In  the medium term, the projection is a touch weaker than in  August (Chart 5.8), largely reflecting the rise in the yield curve  since then.  Within demand, consumption growth is projected  to remain well below past average rates.  But strong global  growth, together with the lower level of sterling, supports net  trade and investment.  The risks around the central projection  are judged to be balanced, rather than skewed to the downside  as in August, reflecting a more balanced global outlook.  That  projection assumes that households and companies base their  decisions on the expectation of a smooth adjustment to the  United Kingdom’s new trading relationship with the  European Union.  The economy’s supply capacity is also projected to grow at a  relatively modest pace over the forecast period.  The MPC  judges there to be a little less slack at the start of the forecast  period than in August, and that is used up by the end.   Unemployment is projected to remain around 42-year lows  (Chart 5.9), lower than projected in August (Table 5.A).      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 2013 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Unemployment rate, per cent Chart 5.9  Unemployment projection based on market  interest rate expectations, other policy measures as  announced The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for LFS unemployment.  It has been  conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.A footnote (b).  The coloured bands have the same  interpretation as in Chart 5.1, and portray 90% of the probability distribution.  The calibration of  this fan chart takes account of the likely path dependency of the economy, where, for example,  it is judged that shocks to unemployment in one quarter will continue to have some effect on  unemployment in successive quarters.  The fan begins in 2017 Q3, a quarter earlier than the fan  for CPI inflation.  That is because Q3 is a staff projection for the unemployment rate, based in  part on data for July and August.  The unemployment rate was 4.3% in the three months to  August, and is projected to be 4.3% in Q3 as a whole.  A significant proportion of this  distribution lies below Bank staff’s current estimate of the long-term equilibrium unemployment  rate.  There is therefore uncertainty about the precise calibration of this fan chart. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 2017 18 19 20 Probability of inﬂation at or below the target, inverted (per cent)      Probability of inﬂation above the target (per cent)     Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 November August Chart 5.10  Inflation probabilities relative to the target The November and August swathes in this chart are derived from the same distributions as  Charts 5.2 and 5.3 respectively.  They indicate the assessed probability of inflation relative to  the target in each quarter of the forecast period.

The projections have been conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.A  footnote (b).  	 Section 5  Prospects for inflation	 43 Inflation remains well above the MPC’s 2% target and is  projected to rise a little further in the near term, peaking  around 3¼% in October.  Above-target inflation reflects the  impact of higher import prices following sterling’s  depreciation.  Inflation is projected to fall back over 2018,  largely reflecting a declining contribution from energy prices.   Higher import prices are judged likely to take some time to  work fully through to CPI inflation.  Although their effect  diminishes in the second half of the forecast period, they are  still pushing inflation above the target at the three-year point.   Domestic inflationary pressures build over the forecast period.   CPI inflation is judged likely still to be slightly above the  2% target at the three-year forecast horizon (Table 5.G).  The  projection is a little lower than three months ago in the  medium term (Chart 5.10), reflecting the higher yield curve.   The risks around the inflation projection remain balanced  (Chart 5.11).  Charts 5.12 and 5.13 show the MPC’s projections under the  alternative constant rate assumption and an unchanged stock  of purchased assets.  That assumption holds Bank Rate at  0.5% throughout the three years of the forecast period, before  it rises towards the market path over the subsequent three  years.  Under that path, four-quarter GDP growth is projected  to pick up a little more than in the market curve projection,  slack to be eroded by the middle of the forecast period and  demand to then rise notably above potential supply.   Reflecting that greater pressure of demand on supply, inflation  would end the forecast period around 2½%, further above the  target than under the market path projection. 1.0  0.0  1.0  2.0  3.0  4.0  5.0  6.0  Probability density, per cent(b)  – + November August 0 1 2 3 4 Chart 5.11  Projected probabilities of CPI inflation in  2019 Q4 (central 90% of the distribution)(a) (a)	 Chart 5.11 represents the cross-section of the CPI inflation fan chart in 2019 Q4 for the  market interest rate projection.

Forecasters’ central  projections for the unemployment rate have, on average,  continued to decline, and are now similar to or slightly below  projections produced prior to the EU referendum (Chart A). External forecasters’ central expectations for CPI inflation at  all horizons were, on average, lower than three months ago  (Table 1).  And survey respondents, on average, put less weight  on inflation being 0.5 percentage points or more above the  target in two years’ time than they had three months ago  (Chart B). External forecasters, on average, expected somewhat less  monetary stimulus over the next three years than they did at  the time of the August Report, broadly consistent with the  steepening of the market-implied path for Bank Rate  (Section 1 and Chart C).  Respondents projected Bank Rate to  rise to 0.9% in two years’ time, compared with 0.7% in  August.  As in August, almost all forecasters expected the  current stock of gilt and corporate bond purchases to remain  unchanged over the next three years.

2019-11-07,"Monetary Policy Report November 2019 Monetary Policy Committee  Monetary policy at the Bank of England The objectives of monetary policy The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to keep inflation low and stable, which supports  growth and jobs. Subject to maintaining price stability, the MPC is also required to support the Government’s  economic policy. The Government has set the MPC a target for the 12-month increase in the Consumer Prices Index of 2%.   The 2% inflation target is symmetric and applies at all times.  The MPC’s remit recognises, however, that the actual inflation rate will depart from its target as a result of shocks and  disturbances, and that attempts to keep inflation at target in these circumstances may cause undesirable volatility in  output. In exceptional circumstances, the appropriate horizon for returning inflation to target can vary. The MPC will  communicate how and when it intends to return inflation to the target.   The instruments of monetary policy The MPC currently uses two main monetary policy tools. First, we set the interest rate that banks and building societies  earn on deposits, or ‘reserves’, placed with the Bank of England — this is Bank Rate. Second, we can buy government  and corporate bonds, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves — this is asset purchases or quantitative easing.  The Monetary Policy Report The MPC is committed to clear, transparent communication. The Monetary Policy Report (MPR), previously the  Inflation Report, is a key part of that. It allows the MPC to share its thinking and explain the reasons for its decisions.  We have made some changes to the structure and content of the MPR. The main purpose of the document is still to  set out the analysis behind the MPC’s decision. The Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff under the guidance of the members of the MPC. Although not every  member will agree with every assumption on which our projections are based, the central projections represent the  MPC’s best collective judgement about the most likely paths for inflation, output and unemployment. This Report has been prepared and published by the Bank of England in accordance with section 18 of the Bank of  England Act 1998.

At its  meeting ending on 6 November 2019, the MPC voted by a majority of 7–2 to maintain  Bank Rate at 0.75%. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling  non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of  central bank reserves, at £10 billion. The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain  the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank  reserves, at £435 billion. The Committee’s new projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying November Monetary  Policy Report. They are now based on the assumption of an orderly transition to a deep free trade agreement between  the United Kingdom and the European Union. Looking through Brexit-related volatility, underlying UK GDP growth has slowed materially this year and a small  margin of excess supply has opened up. That slowdown reflects weaker global growth, driven by trade protectionism,  and the domestic impact of Brexit-related uncertainties.   In October, the UK and EU agreed a Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration as well as a flexible extension of  Article 50. As a consequence, the perceived likelihood of a no-deal Brexit has fallen markedly and the sterling  exchange rate has appreciated. These agreements are expected to remove some of the uncertainty facing businesses  and households, and the MPC projects that UK GDP growth will pick up during 2020. This will be further supported by  easier UK fiscal policy and a modest recovery in global growth. Over the remainder of the forecast period, demand  growth is expected to outstrip the subdued pace of supply growth, which is restrained to some extent by the  adjustment to new trading arrangements with the EU.    Inflationary pressures are projected to lessen in the near term. CPI inflation remained at 1.7% in September and is  expected to decline to around 1¼% by the spring, owing to the temporary effect of falls in regulated energy and water  prices. While unit labour costs have been growing at rates above those consistent with meeting the inflation target  and core services CPI inflation has begun to increase somewhat, employment growth has slowed and pay growth is  likely to fall back in the near term. In the second half of the MPC’s forecast period, however, as a significant margin of  excess demand emerges, domestic inflationary pressures are expected to build. Conditioned on current market yields,  CPI inflation is projected to rise to slightly above 2% towards the end of the forecast period.   Monetary policy could respond in either direction to changes in the economic outlook in order to ensure a sustainable  return of inflation to the 2% target. The Committee will, among other factors, monitor closely the responses of  companies and households to Brexit developments as well as the prospects for a recovery in global growth. If global  growth fails to stabilise or if Brexit uncertainties remain entrenched, monetary policy may need to reinforce the  expected recovery in UK GDP growth and inflation. Further ahead, provided these risks do not materialise and the  economy recovers broadly in line with the MPC’s latest projections, some modest tightening of policy, at a gradual  pace and to a limited extent, may be needed to maintain inflation sustainably at the target.   The MPC judges at this meeting that the existing stance of monetary policy is appropriate.  	 Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 1 The economic outlook   1 1 The economic outlook   Underlying UK GDP growth slowed materially in 2019 as weaker global growth and  Brexit-related uncertainties weighed on spending. Weaker world growth has been partly  driven by trade protectionism and an associated rise in global uncertainty. The MPC judges  that UK growth has slowed to below-potential rates. As a result, the economy now has a  modest amount of slack, which persists in the first part of the forecast. In October, the UK and EU agreed a Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration, the  UK House of Commons approved the second reading of the Bill that translates the  agreement into law, and the UK and EU agreed a flexible extension of Article 50. Sterling  has appreciated markedly as the perceived probability of a no-deal Brexit has reduced.  These developments are also likely to remove some of the uncertainty that has been facing  businesses and households. Reflecting government policy, the MPC’s projections are now conditioned on the  assumption that the UK moves to a deep free trade agreement with the EU. They are also  conditioned on the current market path for interest rates, which projects that Bank Rate  will be below its current level over the forecast period. Under those assumptions,  UK demand is projected to recover and to grow faster than the subdued pace of supply  growth. This recovery reflects the assumed reduction in the uncertainty facing businesses  and households, more supportive fiscal policy and a gradual pickup in global growth. As a  result, excess demand and domestic price pressures build gradually. CPI inflation declines  further below 2% in the near term because of falls in energy prices and water bills, but rises  to the target in the second year, and slightly above it towards the end of the forecast  period.  1.1 Recent developments Underlying UK GDP growth has slowed materially over the past year. While UK GDP growth has been volatile this year because of Brexit-related factors, underlying activity has weakened  (Section 2). Quarterly growth over 2019 as a whole is expected to have averaged only 0.2%, roughly half the average  in the previous three years and below the MPC’s assessment of the economy’s potential rate of growth. That slowing has been driven partly by weakening global growth… Subdued underlying UK GDP growth partly reflects the impact of weaker global growth. The world economy has  experienced a marked, broad-based slowdown (Chart 1.1), and is now expanding at its slowest pace since 2009. The  principal drivers of the slowdown are the rise in trade protectionism (Section 3), the impact of the past tightening in  global financial conditions and domestic weakness in some large emerging market economies. Weak world activity has  reduced demand for UK exports. Greater protectionism has increased global uncertainty, which is dampening  investment spending in many countries, including the UK.  	 Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 1 The economic outlook   2 …and importantly by increasingly entrenched Brexit-related uncertainties. UK spending has been materially dampened by increased uncertainties related to the Brexit process. In particular, the  proportion of companies that report high uncertainty about Brexit has been elevated (Chart 1.2), and businesses on  average expect Brexit to have a negative effect on their sales (Section 4). Those factors are likely to have weighed on  business investment, which — unusually during an expansion — has fallen in five out of the past six quarters.  Consumer spending has been more resilient to the uncertainties around Brexit, although these appear to have weighed  on some discretionary spending and housing. While household spending has been underpinned by strong real income  growth, consumption growth has weakened somewhat and the household saving rate has drifted up over the past  couple of years, despite the strong labour market. A small margin of excess supply is judged to have emerged since the turn of the year. The slowing in underlying GDP growth to below the MPC’s estimate of potential growth has led to a margin of slack  opening up in the UK economy. The degree of spare capacity in the economy is judged to be modest, however. CPI inflation has been close to the 2% target. Inflation has been close to 2% in recent months, averaging 1.8% during 2019 Q3. Over the past year or so, inflation  has fallen, accounted for by weaker goods price inflation, which in turn has been driven partly by the fading impact  from sterling’s past depreciation. In contrast, core services price inflation has increased. That is consistent with a rise in  domestic price pressures, and is likely to reflect the gradual pass-through of the strong pickup in pay growth over the  past few years. 1.2 The MPC’s projections The House of Commons has for the first time approved the second reading of a Bill to implement the  Withdrawal Agreement agreed between the UK and EU. On 17 October, a Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration on the framework for the future relationship  between the UK and the EU was agreed, setting out a broad partnership with a free trade agreement at its core.  On 22 October, the UK House of Commons approved the second reading of the Bill which is intended to implement  the agreement in UK law. Reflecting those developments, the MPC’s projections are now conditioned on a transition  to a deep free trade agreement (FTA) (Box 1). On 28 October, the UK’s EU membership was extended by up to a  further three months to 31 January 2020. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Advanced economies Emerging market economies Per cent World 2012 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 Chart 1.1 Global growth has slowed sharply Four-quarter PPP-weighted GDP growth(a) Sources: Eikon from Refinitiv, IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO) and Bank calculations.

Before August 2018, data are  interpolated between waves and shown as three-month rolling averages.    	 Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 1 The economic outlook   3 The Withdrawal Agreement is likely to reduce near-term uncertainties… The Brexit uncertainties that have been facing households, businesses and financial markets are assumed to decline  gradually over the forecast period, leading to a pickup in household and especially business spending. The progress of  the Withdrawal Agreement and the extension of the UK’s EU membership are likely to remove some uncertainty and  support confidence in the near term, partly driven by a reduction in the risk of a no-deal Brexit. Some uncertainty is  likely to persist, however, as the details of the UK and EU’s eventual relationship are assumed to emerge only  gradually over time and the smoothness of the transition to it remains to be determined. …and sterling has appreciated. The fall in the perceived likelihood of a no-deal Brexit has also been associated with an appreciation of the sterling  exchange rate, which has risen by around 4% over the past three months. As a result, the level of sterling is now more  consistent with the MPC’s Brexit conditioning assumption. As the MPC set out in more detail in the August Report,  UK asset prices reflect the probability market participants attach to the full range of possible Brexit outcomes,  including a no-deal Brexit. That can lead to inconsistencies in the MPC’s forecasts, which do not include elsewhere the  possibility that the UK leaves the EU without a deal. As a result, the possibility of a no-deal Brexit had weighed on  sterling, pushing up the MPC’s earlier projections for GDP and inflation.  The projections are conditioned on the Government’s recent fiscal measures, which provide stimulus to  demand. The MPC’s projections are conditioned on the Government’s tax and spending plans, which include a large increase in  planned spending, as announced in September as part of Spending Round 2019. All else equal, the increase in spending  is expected to raise GDP by around 0.4% over the MPC’s forecast period. The projections are also conditioned on the  market path for interest rates, which declines a little in the near term and ends the forecast period at around 0.5%.  That accommodative path for monetary policy also supports the recovery in GDP growth. Global GDP growth Global GDP growth is expected to remain slow, as protectionism weighs on trade flows, business sentiment and  investment, but picks up a little over the forecast period. The MPC judges that some of the factors that have weighed on global activity over the recent past continue, such that  global GDP growth is projected to remain at below-potential rates over coming quarters. Weakness in the euro area  and some emerging market economies (EMEs) is expected to continue to restrain growth in the near term, with trade  protectionism also acting as a drag. Protectionism weighs on trade flows directly and also indirectly through global  uncertainty, business confidence and investment. Nonetheless, global growth is projected to pick up gradually over  the forecast period, partly accounted for by a recovery in growth in some emerging economies. Growth is also  supported by the loosening of monetary policy. In the central forecast, PPP-weighted world GDP growth gradually  picks up from 3% in 2019 to 3½% in 2021 and 2022 (Chart 1.3). Weighted by UK export shares, world GDP growth is  expected to pick up from 1¾% in 2019 to 2¼% in 2021 and 2022. Weak global growth continues to weigh on UK export growth and investment. Slow global growth is assumed to affect UK growth through trade channels, as well as via an effect on business  spending. The higher uncertainty and lower sentiment associated with trade tensions weighs on UK business  investment as well as that in other countries.  UK GDP growth Growth of the UK’s supply capacity is subdued. Potential productivity is projected to grow at around ¾% on average over the forecast period, although it picks up a  little in the final year of the forecast period to around 1%. Productivity growth is very low relative to pre-crisis rates  of around 2¼%, reflecting a continuation of the post-crisis trend, weak business investment and reduced openness  as the UK transitions to its new trading relationship with the EU. Labour supply is assumed to grow by around  ½% per year. As a result, total potential supply growth is subdued relative to historical rates, averaging around 1¼%  over the forecast period, reaching 1½% by the end. Lower supply growth reduces the pace of GDP growth that is  consistent with the MPC meeting its 2% inflation target.

Underlying UK demand growth remains a little below potential in the near term, but picks up during 2020 as the  dampening effects from Brexit-related uncertainties begin to dissipate (Chart 1.4). That boosts business investment  growth in particular. The pickup in GDP growth is also supported by easier fiscal policy and the gradual recovery in  global growth. In the central forecast, UK GDP growth picks up from 1.0% in 2019 Q4 to 1.6% in 2020 Q4, 1.8% in  2021 Q4 and 2.1% in 2022 Q4 (Table 1.A). Four-quarter business investment growth picks up materially, from negative rates to around 4½% by 2022  (Chart 1.5). It is supported by the reduction in uncertainty, although slower global growth dampens investment  spending. Household consumption rises broadly in line with real income growth over the forecast period as a whole.  Consumption growth picks up from about 1% currently to 1½% in 2020, and 2% by 2022. On average over the  forecast period, consumption grows somewhat more slowly than its historical pace, as real income growth is  dampened by weak productivity growth. Both exports and imports growth fall as companies transition to the UK and  EU’s new trading arrangements. On average over the forecast period, net trade weighs a little on growth.   4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 1998 2001 04 07 10 13 16 19 22 Percentage changes on previous year UK-weighted PPP-weighted Diamonds: projections consistent  with the MPC key judgements  in November  + – Chart 1.3 Global growth is expected to recover somewhat  over the forecast period World GDP(a) Sources: Eikon from Refinitiv, IMF WEO and Bank calculations.

To aid comparability with the  official data, it does not include the backcast for expected revisions, which is available from the  ‘Download the chart slides and data’ link at www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy- report/2019/november-2019. To the right of the vertical line, the distribution reflects uncertainty  over the evolution of GDP growth in the future. If economic circumstances identical to today’s  were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that the mature estimate  of GDP growth would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of those occasions. The  fan chart is constructed so that outturns are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter  green areas on 30 occasions. In any particular quarter of the forecast period, GDP growth is  therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fan on 90 out of 100 occasions. And on the  remaining 10 out of 100 occasions GDP growth can fall anywhere outside the green area of the  fan chart. Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey background.

Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 1 The economic outlook   5 Direct comparisons between the August and November projections are misleading because of inconsistencies in  the August projections. As explained in the August Report, the economic projections for growth and inflation at that time were mechanically  boosted by the inconsistencies between asset prices and the Brexit conditioning assumption. Given that, comparisons  between them and the MPC’s latest projections could be difficult to interpret. Specifically, asset prices had at that  time factored in a significant probability of a no-deal no-transition Brexit, whereas the MPC’s economic projections  did not include that possibility but rather were conditioned on the assumption of a smooth transition to the average  of a range of possible outcomes for the UK’s eventual trading relationship with the EU.   The sharp fall in the perceived likelihood of a no-deal no-transition Brexit over the past three months, and the  response of asset prices to that, means the inconsistencies within the August projections have been substantially  reduced in the latest projections described in this Report. Consequently, direct comparisons of the two sets of  projections could provide a misleading representation of how recent developments have affected the economic  outlook over the past three months. The outlook for global demand has weakened since the time of the August Report, for the reasons described above.  Those developments will also have affected both UK and global asset prices over the past three months.  Since the August 2016 Report, the MPC’s projections have been conditioned on the assumption of a smooth transition  to an average of possible end-states, with the adjustment taking place gradually over many years. Consistent with the  provisions of the Withdrawal Agreement, the MPC’s latest projections are now conditioned on the assumption that a  greater proportion of the adjustment to the UK’s new trading arrangements with the EU takes place within the  three-year forecast period.   In the MPC’s latest projection, the level of GDP ends the forecast period around 1% lower than in August. Three  quarters of that difference is accounted for by the moves in asset prices and the weaker global environment. The  remaining quarter can be accounted for by the net impact of the changes to the MPC’s Brexit conditioning assumption  described in Box 1 and the fiscal measures announced in Spending Round 2019. Table 1.B shows August projections  adjusted for the impact of changes in asset prices and the world outlook since then. Excess supply/demand  Slack is projected to remain in the first part of the forecast period, but, as GDP growth recovers, spare capacity  is eroded and excess demand builds. Some slack persists over coming quarters, but it is eroded as GDP growth picks up to above the subdued rate of  potential supply growth around the middle of 2020. Excess demand emerges in 2021 and builds over the remainder of  the forecast period, reaching 1¼% of potential GDP by the end (Table 1.A). The unemployment rate falls to around  3½% by the end of the forecast period (Chart 1.6). 20 15 10 5 0 5 10 15 2000 03 06 09 12 15 18 21 Projection consistent with MPC key judgements in November Percentage change on previous year + – Chart 1.5 Business investment growth is projected to  pick up materially Business investment(a) Sources: ONS and Bank calculations.

Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 1 The economic outlook   6 CPI inflation CPI inflation is projected to decline notably in the near term reflecting the impact of lower regulated energy  and utilities prices… Over the coming quarters, inflation will be affected by developments in a number of regulated prices. The price cap  affecting household gas and electricity bills has fallen, which will reduce the contribution of energy prices to inflation,  as will the fall in sterling oil prices over the past year. In addition, water bills are projected to fall in April 2020 in line  with the draft determination of the regulator, Ofwat (Section 2). CPI inflation is expected to fall to an average of 1.2%  in 2020 Q2 as a result. …but further out inflation rises, supported by building excess demand. Inflation picks up as those temporary effects begin to fade towards the end of 2020. It is supported by rising excess  demand, which leads to stronger domestic inflationary pressures. Wage growth is projected to be around 3¾% over  the second half of the forecast period, supported by low unemployment. Taken together with weak productivity  growth, that means unit labour cost growth is robust. CPI inflation is projected to rise to 2.0% in the second year of  the MPC’s forecast, and 2.2% in the third year (Chart 1.7). Policy decision At its meeting ending on 6 November 2019, the MPC judged that the existing stance of monetary policy was  appropriate. The MPC voted to maintain Bank Rate at 0.75%, to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial  investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at £10 billion and  to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £435 billion. The factors behind that decision are set out in the Monetary Policy Summary on page i of this Report and  in more detail in the Minutes of the meeting. Monetary policy could respond in either direction to changes in the economic outlook in order to ensure a sustainable  return of inflation to the 2% target. The Committee would, among other factors, monitor closely the responses of  companies and households to Brexit developments as well as the prospects for a recovery in global growth. If global  growth failed to stabilise or if Brexit uncertainties remained entrenched, monetary policy might need to reinforce the  expected recovery in UK GDP growth and inflation. Further ahead, provided these risks did not materialise and the  economy recovered broadly in line with the MPC’s latest projections, some modest tightening of policy, at a gradual  pace and to a limited extent, might be needed to maintain inflation sustainably at the target. 2015 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Unemployment rate, per cent Chart 1.6 Unemployment projection based on market  interest rate expectations, other policy measures as  announced  The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for LFS unemployment.

The calibration of  this fan chart takes account of the likely path dependency of the economy, where, for example, it is  judged that shocks to unemployment in one quarter will continue to have some effect on  unemployment in successive quarters. The fan begins in 2019 Q3, a quarter earlier than the fan for  CPI inflation. That is because Q3 is a staff projection for the unemployment rate, based in part on  data for July and August. The unemployment rate was 3.9% in the three months to August, and is  projected to be 3.8% in Q3 as a whole. A significant proportion of this distribution lies below  Bank staff’s current estimate of the long-term equilibrium unemployment rate. There is therefore  uncertainty about the precise calibration of this fan chart. + – 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 2015 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Percentage increase in prices on a year earlier Chart 1.7 CPI inflation projection based on market interest  rate expectations, other policy measures as announced  Chart 1.7 depicts the probability of various outcomes for CPI inflation in the future.

Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 1 The economic outlook   7 1.3 Key judgements and risks Key Judgement 1: global GDP growth is projected to remain slow in the first part of the forecast period,  partly reflecting the impact of trade protectionism, before rising gradually towards potential rates. GDP growth is projected to continue to be slow in the near term, particularly in the euro area and some EMEs, in  part reflecting the impact of trade tensions.  The MPC judges that protectionism is likely to continue to weigh on GDP growth both directly through its effects on  trade flows, and through its indirect effects on uncertainty, business sentiment and investment (Section 3). The risks  around the MPC’s judgement about the impact of protectionism are two-sided. Some of those risks relate to the  extent of trade barriers — for example, the projections assume that no further trade barriers are announced, but they  also assume that no existing tariff increases are rolled back. In addition, the estimates of their effects on economic  activity are uncertain. There is a chance that the indirect effects could be bigger, consistent with some investors’ views  that a trade war is the top risk to the global outlook (Section 3). Nonetheless, the projections include relatively sizable  indirect effects, including in the euro area, where growth is judged likely to be dampened by concerns that further  tariffs could be introduced, as well as through spillover effects from the impact of tariffs on Chinese demand. The MPC projects that global growth will recover a little, with the risks around the outlook broadly balanced. While trade protectionism continues to weigh on activity, global growth begins to pick up a little during 2020. That  pickup is partly accounted for by a recovery in growth in some emerging economies, which have been hit by  idiosyncratic shocks, for example in Turkey and Argentina. It is also supported by the loosening of monetary policy.  There is a risk that the interest rate required to boost demand and return inflation sustainably to target rates has  declined somewhat, however, due to higher levels of uncertainty.   The MPC judges that the risks around the global growth projection are broadly balanced. Key Judgement 2: supply growth is subdued. Supply growth has been further restrained by the impact of uncertainty. The MPC judges that potential supply growth is likely to have been restrained somewhat recently by Brexit weighing  on potential productivity growth. That might have occurred through lower business investment reducing capital  deepening. In addition, preparations for Brexit are likely to have diverted resources away from productive output or  making improvements. The resources devoted to Brexit preparations have increased in 2019. As a result, the degree of slack that has opened up over the past year might be a little less than would have been  implied by the weakening in demand growth alone. That is consistent with the fact that unemployment has remained  low, and below the MPC’s estimate of its equilibrium rate. Slack is assumed to lie within companies, consistent with  some survey measures of capacity utilisation. Productivity growth remains very low. The MPC judges that productivity growth will pick up a little over the forecast period, but will remain well below its  pre-crisis pace. That limits the rate at which the economy can grow without putting upward pressure on inflation. The  MPC’s projection of subdued productivity growth reflects a continuation of the post-crisis trend, recent weakness in  business investment and the reduction in openness that occurs as the UK economy adjusts to its new trading  arrangements with the EU.   These judgements are subject to risks in both directions. While the empirical relationships between openness, trade  and productivity are well founded (Box 1), the size of the effects are naturally uncertain. In addition, until the details of  the FTA are finalised, there will be uncertainty about the barriers to trade that will arise and when exactly they will  take effect.   Moreover, there are very few recent historical examples of trading relationships becoming less aligned. As such, the  estimated impact on trade flows of joining trading arrangements is assumed to be a proxy for the size of the impact of  leaving them. It is possible that the size of these effects could be different, however. On the one hand, the impact of  trade barriers going up might be smaller than when they go down as the trading relationships are already well   	 Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 1 The economic outlook   8 established. On the other hand, estimates of the average impact across a wide number of countries might understate  the impact of a large, advanced and heavily integrated country leaving an existing trading arrangement. There are also substantial uncertainties around the timing of the effects. The pace at which increased barriers impact  trade flows is likely to depend on the types of barriers that take effect. While some barriers are likely to affect trade  quite quickly — for example, customs declarations that take additional time and cost to complete — the effect of  others is likely to occur more slowly — for example regulations and product standards between the EU and UK are  expected to diverge only gradually over time. The MPC judges that the risks around its projections for potential supply growth — and therefore GDP growth — are  skewed to the downside in the second and third years of the forecast, reflecting the uncertainty around the exact  nature of the FTA with the EU and the transition to it. Key Judgement 3: uncertainty is reduced by the Withdrawal Agreement — providing some support to  UK demand growth. The strength of the pickup in growth will depend importantly on how households and businesses respond to the  Withdrawal Agreement. The Withdrawal Agreement and extension of the UK’s membership of the EU appears to have reduced Brexit-related  uncertainty. In part that reflects some decline in the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. There is substantial evidence that  perceptions of the risk of a no-deal Brexit have declined. Sterling has appreciated, betting odds on a no-deal Brexit in  2019 have fallen and responses to the DMP Survey suggest that the average likelihood that firms attach to that  outcome fell after the second reading of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill was passed. The expected fall in uncertainty is  projected to boost investment and, to a lesser extent, consumption. Four-quarter business investment growth is  projected to pick up from -1½% in 2019 Q2 to 4% in 2021, which drives a recovery in GDP growth over that period.  Nonetheless, it is restrained by weak productivity growth and slow global growth. There are two-sided risks to the outlook for business investment. A greater drag from Brexit uncertainty could persist  in the near term if businesses judge that they continue to need greater clarity about the specific details of the UK’s  future trading relationship and the speed of the adjustment to it. Alternatively, there could be a bigger rebound in  investment if companies bring back a larger number of previously paused projects. Spending growth will also be sensitive to how households respond to uncertainty. The saving ratio and household  financial balance have drifted up a little over the past couple of years, which might suggest that households have  undertaken some precautionary savings in response to higher uncertainty. Historically, households’ savings have  increased mainly in response to higher concerns about their job prospects.     Over the forecast period as a whole, household consumption is projected to grow broadly in line with real income  growth. Households’ confidence and spending should be supported by unemployment remaining low. Nonetheless,  there are risks around those judgements.  The risks around the UK growth forecast are judged to be skewed to the downside, reflecting the downside risks  to supply growth. The outlook for GDP growth will also be sensitive to developments in the UK’s supply capacity. Productivity growth in  the economy impacts demand by affecting the income that households have to spend and the incentive for companies  to invest. Reflecting the risks around the forecast for potential supply growth, the MPC judges that the risks to  UK GDP growth are skewed to the downside in the second and third years of the forecast, reflecting the uncertainty  around the exact nature of the FTA with the EU and the transition to it.  	 Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 1 The economic outlook   9 Key Judgement 4: CPI inflation declines further below 2% in the near term given lower utilities prices,  before rising slightly above the target by the end of the forecast owing to building domestic price  pressures. The projected decline in CPI inflation in the near term is expected to be temporary. While CPI inflation is projected to decline in the near term, that fall is expected to be temporary, given it reflects the  impact of changes in some regulated prices (Section 2). Inflation is projected to fall to 1.2% on average in 2020 Q2  — and the chance that it falls below 1% is judged to be a little less than a half at that point. However, as the effects  of past changes in utilities prices drop out of the annual calculation, inflation is projected to return towards the  2% target. As excess demand builds, domestic price pressures rise. The pickup in inflation is supported by the move from excess supply into excess demand. Throughout the forecast  period, unemployment is projected to be low and wage growth is projected to be relatively strong. With weak  productivity growth, domestic cost growth remains solid and those higher costs are assumed to be passed through to  CPI inflation. It is possible that consumer-facing companies continue to absorb some of the higher cost pressures in  their profit margins so domestic price pressures remain subdued. Alternatively, margins could be maintained or rebuilt  as excess demand rises, leading to domestic price pressures increasing more rapidly.     CPI inflation ends the forecast period a little above the target. Domestically generated inflation is projected to exert upward pressure on CPI inflation over the second half of the  forecast period, such that CPI inflation is at 2% in 2021 Q4 and ends the forecast a little above the MPC’s target. The risks around the MPC’s projection for inflation are judged to be broadly balanced. The risks to the MPC’s inflation forecast are judged to be broadly balanced. In addition to the risks arising from demand,  supply, and pricing conditions, the outlook for CPI inflation will also be affected by movements in sterling, which is  likely to remain sensitive to Brexit developments. 1.4 Constant rate projections In the MPC’s projections conditioned on the alternative assumption of constant interest rates at 0.75%,(1) GDP growth  is slightly weaker, but still recovers to outstrip the subdued rate of supply growth (Chart 1.8). As a result, excess  demand builds over 2021 and 2022. CPI inflation ends the forecast period slightly above the target at 2.1% (Chart 1.9). (1)	 The assumption is that Bank Rate remains at 0.75% throughout the three years of the forecast period, before moving towards the market path over the subsequent  three years. + – 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Percentage increases in output on a year earlier 2015 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Projection ONS data Chart 1.8 GDP projection based on constant nominal  interest rates at 0.75%, other policy measures as  announced See footnote to Chart 1.4. + – 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 2015 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Percentage increase in prices on a year earlier Chart 1.9 CPI inflation projection based on constant  nominal interest rates at 0.75%, other policy measures as  announced See footnote to Chart 1.7.

Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 1 The economic outlook   11 Box 1 The MPC’s conditioning assumption about the UK’s eventual trading relationship with  the EU The MPC’s projections are now conditioned on a transition to a new trading relationship between the UK and  EU. On 17 October, a Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration on the framework for the future relationship  between the UK and the EU was agreed. On 22 October, the UK House of Commons approved the second reading of  the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill. Consistent with those documents, the MPC’s projections are now  conditioned on a deep free trade agreement (FTA) with the EU. On 28 October, the UK’s EU membership was  extended by up to a further three months to 31 January 2020. FTAs can take a wide range of forms depending on the details of the agreement, for example relating to the extent of  barriers to trade across different sectors. Reflecting the aim of the Political Declaration to establish ‘an ambitious,  broad, deep and flexible partnership across trade and economic cooperation with a comprehensive and balanced  Free Trade Agreement at its core’, the MPC’s projections are conditioned on an FTA which is of similar scale and depth  to the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) in place between Canada and the EU.   This box sets out the MPC’s assumptions about the nature of the future trading relationship between the UK and EU  and how the impact of those assumptions on the economy has been modelled using empirical relationships that have  held in the past. Assumptions underpinning the central projection Trade  Goods trade is tariff free, but customs checks are introduced. Consistent with the Political Declaration, the forecast assumes that no tariffs, fees, charges or quantitative restrictions  are introduced. However, the move to a CETA-like FTA would mean that customs, rules of origin and some regulatory  checks between the UK and EU are introduced. Those would raise administrative costs for firms engaging in  cross-border trade with the EU and would particularly affect those industries whose business model relies on the free  flow of goods. As a result, trade flows are likely to fall and some companies might exit the market.     Some services trade would be subject to greater barriers. Some cross-border provision of services is likely to be prevented by regulations once the FTA comes into effect. These  are expected to affect UK financial services in particular: UK financial firms currently have the ability to ‘passport’  financial services into EU Member States and those cross-border access rights are set to be lost. However, it is  assumed that the UK’s regulatory and supervisory regimes are deemed to be equivalent under the EU’s frameworks,  which would mitigate some of the impact. Trade barriers also have a direct effect on some other sectors such as legal  services. For example, UK-based lawyers would lose the right to bring cases before the European Court of Justice.   Regulatory trade barriers with the EU are likely to increase gradually.   At the moment, regulations — such as product standards — are the same in the UK and EU. Over time, some of those  regulations may diverge. That would gradually raise barriers to trade between the UK and EU. For example, companies  producing goods for both UK domestic and EU export markets might have to meet two sets of standards in future,  increasing the complexity of their business and their costs. Some companies might choose instead to focus on one  market.   The UK replicates a substantial proportion of EU trade arrangements with non-EU countries. The UK Government has either negotiated to roll over, or is aiming to roll over, agreements with non-EU countries  that cover 11% of UK trade. In the MPC’s projections it is assumed that these agreements are implemented. It is also  assumed that no further trade deals with non-EU countries are implemented before the end of the forecast period,  reflecting the fact that it typically takes several years for new trade deals to be negotiated and implemented.  Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 1 The economic outlook   12 Preparedness Authorities and businesses are assumed to be ready for the change in trading arrangements. Authorities and businesses are assumed to use the time ahead of the FTA coming into effect to put in place the  necessary physical and regulatory arrangements for a smooth transition to the new trading arrangements.  Consequently, the projections assume that there is no additional reduction in trade from disruption owing to a lack of  preparedness. As such, the projections assume that the physical infrastructure and capabilities required for new checks  on both sides of the UK-EU border are in place ahead of the FTA taking effect, and that firms complete the process of  obtaining EU certification for their products. Modelling the effects of these assumptions on the economy The effects of these assumptions on the economy are modelled using empirical relationships based on past data. The  relationships summarised here are outlined in detail in Chapter 2 of EU withdrawal scenarios and monetary and financial  stability. A range of evidence suggests that greater openness to trade increases productivity. A range of theoretical work and empirical evidence suggests that greater openness supports productivity, raising  economic output and improving living standards. This occurs through both increases in trade and foreign direct  investment (FDI) flows.  Greater openness to trade is thought to increase productivity through a number of channels including: increased  innovation and the adoption of new ideas and practices (see, eg Grossman and Helpman (1991)(1) and Eaton and  Kortum (2002)); greater specialisation, exploiting cross-country returns to scale and scope (see, eg Krugman (1979)  and Mayer, Melitz and Ottaviano (2016)); and better matching of capital and labour within an economy, improving the  allocation of resources. Increased flows of FDI also increase productivity. FDI has been associated with productivity spillovers to domestically  owned firms through knowledge and technology transfers, for example (see, eg Haskel, Pereira and Slaughter (2007)).  Those firms engaged in FDI are estimated to be more productive than those that are not (see ONS (2017)).  The economic effects of the free trade agreement are estimated using gravity models. The scale of the longer-term falls in trade and FDI flows that underlie the MPC’s central projection are estimated using  gravity models (see eg Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) and Brenton, Di Mauro and Lücke (1999)). Gravity models  have been used extensively in the international trade literature for analysing the determinants of bilateral trade. The  gravity models developed by Bank staff are based on a substantial data set: the model for goods trade is estimated on  more than 600,000 observations, while the one for services trade uses 51,000 observations. The models can be used  to isolate the effect of different trading arrangements between economies, separating them from other key  determinants such as size and distance. This allows for the development of well-founded estimates on the eventual  volume of UK trade with the EU and other countries. Nevertheless, as trade openness has generally risen over time,  there is a large degree of uncertainty around the estimated effects of the UK becoming less open to trade with the EU.

Table 1 Summary of assumptions Trading arrangements  Tariffs  No tariffs on UK-EU trade. Customs barriers  Customs checks on UK-EU trade introduced. Services barriers  Some regulatory barriers to trade emerge. Financial services lose passporting rights, but the granting of equivalence   mitigates some of the impact. Some other sectors, such as legal services, lose some access to the EU market.  Other barriers  Product standards diverge gradually. Trade deals  UK retains access to trade arrangements between the EU and non-EU countries worth 11% of total UK trade.   No further trade deals with non-EU countries implemented before the end of the forecast period.   Preparedness for new trading arrangements  Authorities and businesses use the time ahead of the FTA coming into effect to put in place the necessary measures   to avoid the additional reduction in trade that would arise from a lack of preparedness for new border and regulatory   arrangements.				  Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 1 The economic outlook   13    The MPC’s estimates assume that the estimated impact on trade flows of joining trading arrangements is a proxy for  the size of the impact of leaving them.   The reduction in trade flows embodied within the MPC’s central projection is estimated separately for goods and  services. These models allow for trade diversion. While Brexit will decrease trade between the UK and the EU, the UK’s  trade with other countries is likely to increase slightly.   Estimates of the elasticities between openness and productivity are used to convert the estimated falls in trade flows  and FDI into effects on GDP. The MPC assumes that a 1% fall in trade flows leads to a 0.25% fall in productivity.   This lies within the range of estimates from the economic literature (see, eg Feyrer (2009)). The MPC assumes that   a 1% fall in FDI leads to a 0.04% fall in productivity, again in line with estimates from economic research   (see, eg de Mello (1999)). Trade barriers rise over the forecast period, but the adjustment is assumed to be orderly. The Withdrawal Agreement includes a transition period to bridge the time between the date of the UK’s exit from the  EU and the entry into force of the new UK-EU partnership arrangements. At present, the transition period is set to end  on 31 December 2020. Some barriers to trade — such as customs checks — would take effect immediately when the  transition period ends. As a result, much of the impact of those trade barriers is likely to be felt over the forecast  period. The MPC’s forecasts assume that the impact of these barriers on the economy is orderly, though. Companies  could take action in anticipation of these barriers coming into force, for example by reorienting their supply chains  away from the EU. Consequently, some of their effect could start to come through before the transition period ends.  In addition, the Withdrawal Agreement allows for the transition period to be extended for up to two years, so some  barriers might come into effect after 1 January 2021. Moreover, some regulatory barriers to trade are likely to emerge  only gradually, for example as goods standards diverge over time.   As a result, the MPC’s projections are conditioned on the assumption that the economic impact of the transition to  the FTA emerges gradually and relatively smoothly from late 2020.  	 Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 1 The economic outlook   14 Box 2 Monetary policy since the August Report At its meeting ending on 18 September 2019, the MPC judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remained  appropriate.  Since the MPC’s August meeting, the trade war between the United States and China had intensified, and the outlook  for global growth had weakened. Monetary policy had been loosened in many major economies. Shifting expectations  about the potential timing and nature of Brexit had continued to generate heightened volatility in UK asset prices, in  particular the sterling exchange rate had risen by over 3½%. Brexit-related developments had made UK economic data more volatile. Having fallen by 0.2% in 2019 Q2,  GDP growth was expected to rise by 0.2% in Q3. The Committee judged that underlying growth had slowed, but  remained slightly positive, and that a degree of excess supply had appeared to have opened up within companies.  Brexit uncertainties had continued to weigh on business investment, although consumption growth had remained  resilient, supported by continued growth in real household income. The weaker global backdrop was weighing on  exports. The Government had announced a significant increase in departmental spending for 2020–21, which could  raise GDP by around 0.4% over the MPC’s forecast period, all else equal.  CPI inflation fell to 1.7% in August, from 2.1% in July, and was expected to remain slightly below the 2% target in the  near term. The labour market appeared to remain tight, with the unemployment rate having been just under 4% since  the beginning of the year. Annual pay growth had strengthened further to the highest rate in over a decade. Unit wage  cost growth had also risen, to a level above that consistent with meeting the inflation target in the medium term. The  labour market did not appear to be tightening further, however, with official and survey measures of employment  growth having softened.  For most of the period following the EU referendum, the degree of slack in the UK economy has been falling and  global growth has been relatively strong. Recently, however, entrenched Brexit uncertainties and slower global growth  had led to the re-emergence of a margin of excess supply. Increased uncertainty about the nature of EU withdrawal  meant that the economy could follow a range of paths over the coming years. The MPC judged that the appropriate  response of monetary policy would depend on the balance of the effects of Brexit on demand, supply and the sterling  exchange rate. It was possible that political events could lead to a further period of entrenched uncertainty about the nature of, and  the transition to, the United Kingdom’s eventual trading relationship with the European Union. The longer those  uncertainties persisted, particularly in an environment of weaker global growth, the more likely it would be that  demand growth would remain below potential, increasing excess supply. In such an eventuality, it was expected that  domestically generated inflationary pressures would be reduced.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the exchange rate would probably fall, CPI inflation rise and GDP growth slow. The  Committee’s interest rate decisions would need to balance the upward pressure on inflation, from the likely fall in  sterling and any reduction in supply capacity, with the downward pressure from any reduction in demand. In this  eventuality, the monetary policy response would not be automatic and could be in either direction.  In the event of greater clarity that the economy is on a path to a smooth Brexit, and assuming some recovery in global  growth, a significant margin of excess demand was likely to build in the medium term. Were that to occur, the  Committee judged that increases in interest rates, at a gradual pace and to a limited extent would be appropriate to  return inflation sustainably to the 2% target.   	 Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 2 Current economic conditions   15 2 Current economic conditions  Global GDP growth has slowed markedly, partly because of escalating trade protectionism.  Several central banks have lowered policy rates, and global financial conditions have  loosened a little. Sterling has appreciated by around 4% since August as the risk of a  no-deal Brexit has fallen. UK GDP growth has been volatile so far this year. Abstracting from temporary factors,  underlying growth has slowed. This reflects the impact of Brexit-related uncertainties and  weaker global growth. Business surveys suggest that the near-term outlook remains subdued. The labour market remains tight, and this has caused pay and domestic cost pressures to  increase. However, employment growth has weakened recently and the slowing in demand  growth has caused a margin of spare capacity to open up. CPI inflation has been close to  target in recent months, although lower energy prices and water bills are likely to cause it  to fall over the next few quarters.

Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 2 Current economic conditions   16 2.1 Global developments and financial conditions Global GDP growth has been weakening… Global output growth has slowed since mid-2018. Four-quarter PPP-weighted global growth was close to 4% in  2018 Q2, but has fallen to under 3% in 2019 Q2. That slowing has been broadly based across advanced economies  and emerging markets (Chart 2.2). Forward-looking indicators remain weak. The manufacturing export orders PMI fell  to its lowest level since 2012 in August. It has recovered slightly since, but remains well below the 50 no-change mark  (Chart 2.3). That suggests that output growth will remain subdued in the near term. …and there has been some further downside news since August. PPP-weighted global output is estimated to have grown by 0.7% in 2019 Q3, slightly lower than expected in August.  Downside news has been concentrated in the euro area, where quarterly GDP growth was 0.2%. Growth in emerging  markets has also been a little weaker than the MPC’s August projection, mainly due to weaker-than-expected growth  in India. The composition of global GDP growth is less balanced than in 2018. The recent weakening of global output growth largely reflects slower investment growth. In major advanced  economies, four-quarter investment growth peaked at 4.4% in late 2017, but has since fallen to 1.5% in 2019 Q2.  Global growth has become increasingly reliant on consumer spending, which has remained relatively robust  (Chart 2.4). The slowdown partly reflects increasing trade protectionism. As discussed in Section 3, trade protectionism has increased since mid-2018. This is estimated to be weighing on  global growth, alongside other factors. Trade protectionism has particularly affected the manufacturing sector: the  global manufacturing PMI has risen very slightly in recent months, but remains below 50 (Chart 2.3). The services  sector has been more resilient so far: the global services PMI has fallen somewhat, but remains above 50. Monetary policy in major economies has loosened in 2019… A number of central banks have lowered policy rates during 2019 (Chart 2.5) and market-implied paths for policy  rates have fallen in some countries (Chart 2.6). In September the European Central Bank (ECB) Governing Council  announced a package of measures which included a cut to the deposit rate to -0.5% and asset purchases of €20 billion  a month. The ECB announced that asset purchases would run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative  impact of its policy rates. In October the Federal Open Market Committee reduced the target range for the federal  funds rate to 1.5%–1.75%, the second cut since the August Report. The market-implied path for US policy rates has  also fallen since August and is consistent with two further cuts to the federal funds rate over the next two years.  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Advanced economies Emerging market economies Per cent World 2012 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 Chart 2.2 Output growth has slowed across advanced  economies and emerging markets Four-quarter PPP-weighted GDP growth(a) Sources: Eikon from Refinitiv, IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO) and Bank calculations.

Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 2 Current economic conditions   17 Forward interest rates for the UK and euro area have changed by less than in the US. Generally global bond yields are  low: around US$13 trillion of global investment-grade debt is now trading with a negative yield. …and fiscal policy has been eased. Government consumption growth across the G7 economies was 0.8% in 2019 Q2, the highest in a decade. The OECD  estimates that the structural government deficit across advanced economies widened to more than 3% of GDP in  2019 (Chart 2.7). Widening structural deficits in the US and some euro-area countries have contributed to that  change. Global financial conditions are a little looser than in August. The fall in US forward interest rates means that global financial conditions are a little looser than in August. Prices of  risky assets — such as equities and corporate bonds — are little changed on average. Accommodative financial  conditions is one reason why the MPC expects global growth to stabilise in the near term. PPP-weighted global GDP is  expected to grow by 0.7% in 2019 Q4, similar to the previous quarter but slightly below the MPC’s August projection. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 2011 13 15 17 19 Investment Percentage changes on a year earlier Consumption Chart 2.4 Investment growth has weakened across  advanced economies, but consumption growth has been  resilient Investment and consumption in the G7 economies(a) Sources: Eikon from Refinitiv, IMF WEO, OECD and Bank calculations.

Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 2 Current economic conditions   18 Sterling has strengthened as the perceived chance of a no-deal Brexit has fallen. Sterling has risen by around 4% since the August Report (Chart 2.8) as the perceived risk of a no-deal Brexit has  receded. Sterling implied volatility remains elevated compared with other major currency pairs (Chart 2.9), however,  suggesting that the outlook for sterling remains particularly uncertain. With forward interest rates little changed since  August (Table 2.A), the sterling appreciation has led to a tightening of UK financial conditions (Chart 2.10).  There have been some signs of tighter corporate credit conditions.  Corporate credit conditions have been accommodative in recent years, particularly for large firms. But there are  some tentative signs that conditions have tightened slightly. An increasing proportion of contacts reported to the  Bank’s Agents that finance has become slightly more expensive or less available over the past year, and the range of  sectors affected had broadened (Box 3). The availability of bank lending was expected to fall in Q4, according to the  Credit Conditions Survey. Actual lending volumes have held up so far, however. Corporate bond issuance and bank  lending were relatively strong in September. August Report  0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 Jan. July Jan.

Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 2 Current economic conditions   19 2.2	 Demand and output UK GDP growth has been volatile this year. UK growth has been volatile this year, largely because of Brexit-related factors. GDP increased by 0.6% in Q1, with  activity boosted by stockbuilding in the UK and elsewhere in the EU ahead of the original March Brexit deadline  (Chart 2.11). GDP then fell by 0.2% in Q2 as firms partially ran down those stocks. The fall also reflected a sharp  decline in car production, as some factories were shut down in April as part of Brexit-related contingency plans. This  was the first quarterly fall in GDP since 2012. GDP growth appears to have returned to positive territory in Q3. Based on official data to August, growth is expected  to have been 0.4% (Chart 2.11). Bank staff expect growth to have been boosted by a rebound in car production and by  a small amount of stockbuilding ahead of the October Brexit deadline. Abstracting from temporary factors, underlying growth has slowed. The volatility in headline growth masks a slowdown in underlying growth. Quarterly growth over 2019 as a whole is  expected to average around 0.2%. That is lower than in the previous three years, when growth averaged around 0.4%  a quarter (Chart 2.12). The slowdown in underlying growth is visible in the services sector, where quarterly growth was  only 0.1% in Q2, the lowest rate in three years. Surveys suggest that growth will remain weak in Q4. Bank staff expect growth to fall back to 0.2% in Q4 (Chart 2.11). A wide range of survey indicators of output have  weakened over the past year, consistent with a decline in underlying growth (Chart 2.13). Forward-looking surveys of  expected output growth are even further below average (Chart 2.14). In isolation, these are consistent with negative  GDP growth in Q4. However, the surveys have underestimated growth in recent quarters. This could be because the  relationship between survey responses and growth may be weaker at times of high uncertainty, as discussed in Box 3  in the February Report. In particular, the elevated risk of a no-deal Brexit could have influenced some firms when they  responded to the most recent surveys. The slowdown in UK growth can be partly explained by Brexit… Brexit-related uncertainties have weighed on UK GDP growth, as discussed in detail in Section 4. Much of this effect is  via weaker demand, although it may also have affected the supply side of the economy (Section 2.3). + – 0.4 0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Percentage points 2019 Other Volatility in monthly output(b) Car factory shutdowns Brexit-related stockbuilding GDP growth (per cent) Chart 2.11 GDP growth has been volatile as a result of  Brexit-related factors  Estimated contributions of various factors to quarterly GDP  growth(a) Sources: ONS and Bank calculations.

Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 2 Current economic conditions   20 Investment by businesses has been particularly affected, falling in five of the past six quarters. The Bank’s Decision  Maker Panel (DMP) Survey shows that firms that are more uncertain about Brexit have made larger cuts to  investment since the EU referendum (Chart 4.7). Research using the survey suggests total business investment is  around 11% lower as a result of Brexit (see Bloom et al (2019)). Consistent with that, business investment growth has  been lower in the UK than in other G7 countries since the referendum, growing by only 0.4% compared to an average  of 13% elsewhere (Chart 2.15). UK exports may also have been reduced as a result of the Brexit process. Trade data have been volatile, in part because  of cross-border stockbuilding before the original March deadline. But a range of surveys suggest that the demand for  UK exports has weakened considerably over the past couple of years (Chart 2.16). Some Agency contacts have  reported that foreign firms are reorienting supply chains away from the UK because of uncertainty about future  trading arrangements (Box 3). + – 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 2017 18 19 Average Differences from averages (number of standard deviations) Range of survey indicators Chart 2.13 Survey indicators of output are weak  Survey indicators of current output growth(a) Sources: BCC, CBI, IHS Markit/CIPS and Bank calculations.

Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 2 Current economic conditions   21 …and partly by the weakening world economy. The slowdown in global growth has also dampened UK growth by weighing on demand for UK exports. It is also likely  to have reduced investment in the UK, in common with other countries over the past year (Chart 2.4). Section 3  discusses developments in the global economy in more detail. Consumer spending growth has slowed… Consumer spending appears to have been relatively resilient to the uncertainty around Brexit, although its growth has  also slowed (Chart 2.17). In 2019 Q2 it grew by 0.3% — similar to the average rate since 2017, but lower than the  average from 2013–15 of 0.6%. Timelier indicators of consumer spending suggest consumption continued to grow at a  similar pace in Q3. Official data on retail sales growth have been strong in recent months (Chart 2.17), even though  surveys of the retail sector have been relatively gloomy. Low household interest rates have supported consumer spending. Mortgage rates and personal loan rates remain near  historical lows, with the rates on some fixed-rate mortgages continuing to fall over the past few months (Table 2.B).  Interest rates on credit cards have increased, although the effective rate paid by the average borrower has remained  stable, in part because of the past lengthening of interest-free periods. …and there are signs consumers are becoming more cautious. The growth of spending on non-essential items(1) has slowed over the past year, which could be consistent with  increasing consumer caution. Households have also increased the proportion of income they save each quarter.  Recently revised data show that the saving ratio increased from an average of 5% over 2017 to 7% in 2019 Q2. The  household financial balance — which captures the difference between saving and investment — was revised up to a  greater extent, partly as a result of changes to the accounting treatment of student loans.  Headline measures of consumer confidence remain close to their past averages, but expectations about the general  economic situation have been below average, and declining, for some time. The GfK/EC October survey recorded the  highest balance of people expecting unemployment to rise since 2013 (Chart 2.18). Demand in the housing market remains subdued.  Households’ concerns about the economic situation are likely to help explain subdued demand in the housing market.  Transaction and mortgage approvals figures have been broadly flat for around five years now. House price growth has  also moderated across the UK since the EU referendum, and prices have fallen in London and the South East over the  past year (Chart 2.19).(2) Leading indicators of the housing market, including timelier but narrower measures of house  (1)	 Spending excluding: most food and non-alcoholic beverages; housing, water and energy costs; repair of household appliances; non-durable household goods for  routine maintenance; dwelling and transport insurance; and financial services not elsewhere classified.

Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 2 Current economic conditions   22 prices, suggest UK house price inflation has stabilised just above zero. The lower rate of price inflation may be feeding  through to house building: the number of private housing starts in England was around 10% lower in 2019 Q2 than a  year earlier. Higher government spending should continue to boost growth. Government spending has been growing faster than expected recently. Central government spending in cash terms  was around 5% higher in the fiscal year to September than the previous year — well above the Office for Budget  Responsibility’s forecast from March. In the National Accounts, real government consumption in Q2 was 4% higher  than a year ago — the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Government borrowing has been revised up over the recent  past following changes to the accounting treatment of student loans and a correction to corporation tax receipts data. Most recently, the Government announced a large increase in spending in September as part of Spending Round 2019.  This included £2 billion of additional departmental spending in 2019–20 and £13 billion in 2020–21. All else equal, this  is expected to raise GDP by around 0.4% over the MPC’s three-year forecast period. 2.3	 Supply, costs and prices The slowdown in underlying GDP growth might suggest there is emerging spare capacity. GDP growth — at around 0.2% per quarter on average over 2019 — has now slowed to below the MPC’s estimate of  potential growth in the medium term of between 0.3% and 0.4% a quarter. That estimate is based on an annual  assessment of the supply side of the economy.(3) The MPC judges that demand and supply were broadly in balance  around the start of the year. Therefore, if supply growth has remained stable, a degree of spare capacity has probably  opened up in the economy. But supply growth may also have slowed. Labour productivity, measured as output per hour worked, fell by 0.5% in the year to Q2, although it is expected to  have recovered a little in Q3 (Chart 2.20). While productivity growth has been consistently weak since the financial  crisis a decade ago, the fall in the year to Q2 was the biggest four-quarter fall since 2012. As discussed in previous  Reports, much of the post-crisis weakness in productivity growth can be accounted for by the financial and  manufacturing sectors. Productivity growth remained weak in those sectors in the latest data, but the decline over the  past year reflects broader weakness (Chart 2.21). As well as reflecting weaker demand, it is possible that the weak  (3)	See the February 2019 Inflation Report for more information. + – 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 2012 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 Differences from averages (number of standard deviations) General economic situation expectations(c) Unemployment expectations (inverted)(b) Personal ﬁnancial situation expectations(c) Chart 2.18 Households are pessimistic about the  economy, although confidence in their own financial  situation has held up Indicators of consumer confidence(a) Sources: GfK (research carried out on behalf of the European Commission) and Bank calculations.

Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 2 Current economic conditions   23 productivity observed in the data has a structural supply-side element that has reduced potential supply growth. This  would imply that less spare capacity has emerged than the fall in GDP growth might suggest in isolation. Brexit preparations could have dragged on productivity and supply growth. The recent weakness in productivity growth could be a consequence of firms making Brexit preparations. The Bank’s  DMP Survey shows that many firms are committing several hours a week of senior management time to Brexit  planning (Chart 2.22). This could be reducing the time available to make sales or organise production, potentially  detracting from output and productivity growth. Stockbuilding may also have tied up funds that would otherwise have  been used for productivity-enhancing investments. Finally, Brexit may have reduced the growth of internationally  exposed firms by more than domestically focused firms. As the former tend to be more productive, this effect would  reduce average productivity. Research using the DMP Survey estimates that Brexit has reduced productivity by  around 2% since the EU referendum. It may continue to weigh on output while uncertainty remains elevated.   85 90 95 100 105 2001 04 07 10 13 16 19 Index: 2007 = 100 Chart 2.20 Productivity has been weak since the crisis Hourly labour productivity(a) Sources: ONS and Bank calculations.

Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 2 Current economic conditions   24 Some spare capacity may have emerged within firms… The weakness of productivity could also reflect increasing spare capacity within firms. Most survey indicators suggest  spare capacity has widened over the past year, and some imply that capacity utilisation is now below normal levels  (Chart 2.23). However, some of these indicators can be volatile, and the mapping from them to capacity utilisation is  uncertain.  …and although there appears to be little spare capacity in the labour market… The unemployment rate increased slightly to 3.9% in the three months to August, but it remains at a historically low  level. It is also below the MPC’s estimate of the equilibrium rate of unemployment — 4¼% — that would be  consistent with inflation at the target in the medium term. Broader measures of underemployment also suggest there is little spare capacity in the labour market. The average  number of extra hours people would like to work has stabilised around zero, with full-timers wishing to work fewer  hours almost exactly offsetting part-timers who wish to work longer hours (Chart 2.24). And the proportion of the  population who report they would like a job but are not currently seeking one — the marginal attachment ratio — is  also very low. That suggests there is little spare capacity among those not actively looking for a job. The MPC judges that, while spare capacity has emerged in the UK economy, its degree is limited, and it is a little  smaller than the slowing in GDP growth alone might suggest. …there is mounting evidence of weakening demand for labour. While the labour market remains tight, it no longer appears to be tightening. Employment growth has slowed over the  past year, consistent with the weakening in underlying output growth. Employment actually fell in the three months  to August (Chart 2.25). The weakness appears set to continue: surveys of hiring intentions have softened in recent  months (Chart 2.26). And the number of vacancies in the economy has fallen by around 50,000 since the start of the  year, the sharpest fall since 2009 — although the number of vacancies is still very high (Chart 2.27). The tight labour market has caused pay growth to strengthen further… Pay growth has increased steadily over the past few years as the labour market has tightened. Private sector regular  pay growth was 4.0% in the three months to August, as high as it has been in over a decade (Chart 2.28). The  strength in pay growth has been broadly based, with growth picking up in both the private and public sectors in recent  years. 1.0 0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2007 10 13 16 19 Hours Net More hours Fewer hours Self-employed Part-time Full-time + – Chart 2.24 People no longer wish to work longer hours, on  average  Net additional desired hours(a) Sources: Labour Force Survey and Bank calculations.

Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 2 Current economic conditions   25 …but there are signs pay growth will moderate over the coming months. A number of indicators suggest that pay pressures are no longer building, and pay growth may cool over the coming  months (Table 2.D). The Bank’s settlements database suggests pay awards are clustering between 2% and 3%, slightly  lower than a year ago. Surveys by the REC and the Bank’s Agents also suggest pay growth is stabilising a little below  the pace of growth in the official data. It is possible that growth in the official pay figures has been temporarily  boosted by the changing composition of the workforce. Employment has increased in higher paying occupations and  industries, which will tend to increase average pay growth, but only as long as the compositional shift continues  (Chart 2.29). Such effects on pay growth have tended not to persist in the past. More broadly, underlying pay pressures may cool a little in coming quarters as the weakening in GDP growth and  demand for labour reduce pressure on employers to raise pay. + – 1 0 1 2 3 4 2013 14 15 16 17 18 19 Percentage changes on a year earlier Employees Survey indicators of hiring intentions(a) Chart 2.26 Surveys of hiring intentions have weakened  Employees and surveys of hiring intentions Sources: Bank of England, IHS Markit/CIPS, KPMG/REC Report on Jobs, ONS and Bank calculations.

Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 2 Current economic conditions   26 Pay growth has increasingly outpaced productivity growth, causing unit labour cost growth to accelerate. The impact of faster pay growth on firms’ costs has been compounded by weak productivity growth. This has caused  the growth of unit labour costs (ULCs) — the cost of labour needed to produce one unit of output — to pick up  (Chart 2.30). Measures of ULC growth now appear to be above the ranges judged to be consistent with inflation at  the target. A moderation of pay growth as a result of weaker demand would probably cause ULC growth to fall. But a moderation  as a result of compositional effects fading may have less of an effect: the make-up of the workforce should have  similar effects on pay and productivity, and hence have little effect on ULC growth. Firms may have temporarily absorbed higher costs in their profit margins… The Bank’s Agents report that firms in the consumer services sector have struggled to pass higher costs on to  customers. That could explain why CPI-based measures of domestic price pressures still paint a somewhat weaker  picture than labour cost-based measures. …but measures of domestic price pressures based on consumer prices are picking up. Nevertheless, CPI-based measures of domestic price pressures have been increasing recently, suggesting cost  pressures have begun to feed through the supply chain. Core services price inflation increased to 2.5% in September,  the highest rate in almost two years (red line in Chart 2.31). Excluding rents inflation — which has been unusually  weak primarily because of restrictions on social housing rents — core services inflation increased to 2.9%. And the  median services inflation rate — a measure of services price inflation less affected by volatility in individual items  — has been increasing steadily since 2015 (blue line in Chart 2.31). CPI inflation has been close to the target recently… Headline CPI inflation is determined by both domestic and external cost pressures. Inflation has been close to the 2%  target in recent months: it averaged 1.8% over Q3, broadly in line with the August Inflation Report forecast  (Chart 2.1). External cost pressures — such as energy prices and other import prices — are currently making a small  contribution to inflation. Core inflation, which excludes the effects of energy prices and some other volatile  components, was 1.7% in Q3.  …but will fall over the coming months as a result of lower energy prices. CPI inflation is expected to average 1.4% in Q4. Most of the fall reflects a lower contribution to inflation from energy  prices. In October Ofgem reduced the energy price caps affecting default and pre-payment tariffs. Electricity prices  were cut by 3% and gas prices by 9% for the typical default tariff customer. As a result, household energy bills are  expected to drag on inflation in Q4 (Chart 2.32). + – 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 2011 13 15 17 19 Percentage points Wages Productivity Unit wage cost growth (per cent) 12 14 18 16 Chart 2.30 Unit labour cost growth has picked up as a  result of strong pay and weak productivity growth Contributions to four-quarter unit wage cost growth(a) Sources: ONS and Bank calculations.

Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 2 Current economic conditions   27 Fuel prices are also expected to pull down inflation over the next few months. Sterling oil prices are almost 10%  lower than at the time of the August Report and over 20% lower than a year ago. Altogether, the contribution to  CPI inflation from energy prices is expected to fall from around 0.2 percentage points in Q3 to -0.2 percentage points  in Q4. Regulated prices will pull inflation even lower in 2020. A number of other regulated prices are likely to affect inflation over the coming year. Water bills are expected to fall in  April as a result of action by the regulator Ofwat. That will be offset partially by an increase in the social housing rents  cap. These changes, in addition to a further drag from energy prices from April, are expected to result in inflation  falling to 1.2% in 2020 Q2 (Section 1). Core inflation is expected to remain closer to the target, at around 1.5%. Cheaper imports will also pull down inflation. CPI inflation is also sensitive to import prices, which are heavily influenced by the exchange rate. Import price inflation  has been subdued over the past year, following high rates over 2016 and 2017 after sterling’s referendum-related  decline (Chart 2.33). Sterling has appreciated by 4% since the August Report. If sustained, that will lead to lower  import prices over the coming year and pull down CPI inflation. Brexit may have put upward pressure on short-term inflation expectations. Measures of households’ expectations for inflation in one and two years’ time increased slightly in Q3 (Table 2.C) and  are above their post-crisis averages. It is unusual for short-term inflation expectations to increase while the actual  inflation rate has been falling (Chart 2.34). This could be happening now because households are expecting Brexit to  increase prices. In the latest Inflation Attitudes Survey, 50% of respondents reported that Brexit had raised their  expectation for inflation in one year’s time, compared with 10% of respondents who said it had lowered their  expectation. Short-term inflation expectations derived from financial market indicators also increased over Q3, although they fell  back at the start of Q4 (Table 2.C). Market contacts attribute much of the movement to changing expectations about  Brexit and associated expectations for the exchange rate. Long-term expectations appear stable, although financial market measures have become harder to interpret. Measures of households’ long-term expectations fell or remained stable in Q3, and are close to their post-crisis  averages (Table 2.C). Implied expectations for RPI inflation in financial markets at longer horizons have also fallen  (Chart 2.35).

The exact  date for the change is uncertain: the Chancellor has announced his intention to consult on whether to allow the  change to take effect between 2025 and 2030. This uncertainty makes interpreting the signal from these measures  more difficult.  Overall, the MPC judges that indicators of inflation expectations are consistent with inflation close to the 2% target.

Investment intentions also eased further. The Agents’ scores for manufacturing output and exports were their lowest in more than three years. This reflected a  number of factors such as trade tensions and the waning effect of the past depreciation of sterling.  The Agents’ score for capacity utilisation also eased markedly, particularly in manufacturing, reflecting slower activity. Labour market activity appeared to be stabilising. Companies’ employment intentions for the coming 12 months were  broadly flat, and recruitment difficulties appeared to have stopped increasing, though they remained elevated. Pay  growth also seemed to be stabilising, with settlements averaging around 2%–3%. However, some contacts reported  giving larger increases to address skill shortages or to keep pace with the National Living Wage.  Agents’ survey on preparations for EU withdrawal  The Agents surveyed over 300 business contacts on their preparations for EU withdrawal.(3) Almost all respondents said they were either ‘fully ready’ or ‘as ready as can be’ for a no-deal Brexit, up from around  four fifths of respondents in the September survey (Chart A). (1)	 A comprehensive quarterly report on business conditions from the Agents is published alongside the MPC decision in non-Monetary Policy Report months. The next  report will be published on 19 December 2019. (2)	 This is a summary of economic reports compiled by the Agents during September and October 2019. References to activity and prices relate to the past three months  compared with a year earlier. The Agents’ scores are available here. (3)	The survey was conducted between 5 September and 15 October. There were 341 responses from companies employing around 316,000 employees. Responses were  weighted by employment and then reweighted by sector employment. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Jan. Mar. Apr. June July Sep. Oct.

In the January, March and April surveys, we only gave the option to choose ‘Yes’ or  ‘No’. In June, July, September and October respondents could choose between ‘Yes — fully  ready’, ‘Yes — as ready as can be’ and ‘No’. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some respondents  before June who answered ‘yes’ might have responded ‘as ready as can be’ had they been given  the option. 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 Output Employment Investment in UK Investment outside UK Exports Imports Production costs Sales prices Deal — October Deal — all surveys No deal — October No deal — all surveys Percentage changes over the next 12 months(b) + _ Chart B Companies expect output, employment and  investment to be lower in a no-deal Brexit Expectations for a deal and no-deal Brexit(a) (a)	 Companies were asked ‘Relative to the last 12 months, what is your expectation for the  following aspects of your business over the next year in each scenario?’. (b)	 Respondents were asked to choose between ‘Fall greater than 10%’; ‘-10 to -2%’;  ‘Little change’; ‘+2 to +10%’ and ‘Rise greater than 10%’. To calculate these approximate  growth rates, the following midpoint estimates were assumed for each response bucket:  ±6% for the ‘±2-10%’ response category; 0% for the ‘little change’ response category, and  ±15% for the ‘± >10%’ category.  	 Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 2 Current economic conditions   31 However, the survey also showed that companies still expected output, employment and investment to be markedly  lower in a no-deal Brexit compared with a scenario with a deal and transition period (Chart B). This was also the case  for companies that felt ‘ready’ for a no-deal Brexit. Most respondents said they had already implemented or were going to implement some form of contingency plan.  The most commonly reported form of contingency plan by companies in the October survey was obtaining necessary  certifications, followed by engaging with customers to manage risk, seeking alternative input suppliers and building  cash reserves (Chart C). The proportion of companies that said they were stockbuilding was somewhat lower than in  previous surveys.  Taking on extra warehouse space was one of the least popular contingency plans. This is supported by other Agency  intelligence which suggests that companies have been using their own premises to store stock. In addition, availability  of warehousing space was reported to be limited due to the usual stockbuilding ahead of Christmas.  To shed light on whether Brexit might be affecting trade flows, contacts were also asked whether they had seen any  reorientation of supply chains. Eight per cent of respondents reported that overseas companies had begun to reorient  away from UK suppliers. Agency intelligence also suggested that some overseas customers have been reluctant to  close new deals until there is greater clarity on post-Brexit trading arrangements. Fourteen per cent of survey  respondents said that they had made slight shifts away from their overseas suppliers. This was mainly reported by  contacts in consumer and business services.  Around a fifth of companies said that preparing for Brexit had raised their working capital needs, compared with a  third in the September survey. Those companies said they had generally financed working capital needs through  internal cash flow or depleting cash reserves.  The proportion of contacts who reported that finance had become slightly more expensive or less available over the  past year increased a little in the latest survey (Chart D). According to Agency intelligence, the range of sectors  reporting that credit availability had tightened has widened to include car dealerships, smaller house builders and  some manufacturers, particularly in the automotive sector. Credit availability remained relatively tight for retail,  leisure and construction firms. There were signs of a pickup in corporate failures, albeit from a very low base. 0 10 20 30 40 Necessary  certiﬁcations Customer risk  engagement Alternative  input suppliers Building cash  reserves Stockbuilding Operations  elsewhere in EU Changing  haulage/ports Preparing for border  customs checks Additional hedging  — exchange rates Extra warehouse  space Additional hedging  — commodities Undertaken Carrying out Planned Percentages of respondents Chart C Applying for necessary certifications was the most  common contingency plan Types of contingency action(a) (a)	 Companies were asked ‘If applicable, what type of contingency actions has your company  undertaken, is planning or carrying out?

Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 3 In focus Trade protectionism and the global outlook   32 3 In focus Trade protectionism and  the global outlook A number of trade barriers have been introduced since mid-2018, the most significant of  which have been higher tariffs on bilateral trade between the US and China. This increase  in protectionism has contributed to the slowdown in global growth, both via the direct  effects on trade flows, supply chains and import costs, and via the wider indirect effects on  business sentiment, uncertainty and investment around the world. Further protectionist  measures taken since August have led the MPC to revise down its projection for the global  economy and the forecast for UK output growth.  For most of the past 50 years, there has been a general trend across the world towards trade liberalisation. Tariffs on  goods have fallen steadily: the average global tariff rate fell from 8½% in 1994 to 2½% in 2017 (Chart 3.1). Since  mid-2018, however, that trend has begun to reverse. In particular, bilateral tariffs on trade between the US and China  have risen substantially.  The fundamental shift in the direction of trade policy has affected global business sentiment. Measures of trade and  economic policy uncertainty have increased sharply during 2019 (Chart 3.2) and surveys suggest that investors view a  trade war as the top risk to the global outlook. These developments have taken place at a time when the global  economy was already slowing, reflecting the tightening of financial conditions in 2018 — particularly in emerging  markets — and slowing growth in China. This section sets out the MPC’s assessment of the impact of trade protectionism on the global economy. It discusses  how protectionist policies affect the economy (Section 3.1), developments in trade policy to date (Section 3.2) and  provides estimates of their impact on global economic growth so far (Section 3.3). The final section (Section 3.4)  briefly sets out how the slowdown in the global economy has affected the MPC’s forecasts.

These barriers often take the form of tariffs, which for a given exchange rate increase the  price of imported goods relative to those that are domestically produced.(1) Non-tariff measures including import  quotas or changes to regulatory standards can also create barriers to trade.  A rise in the cost of imported goods due to tariffs will lower real incomes and in turn weigh on domestic demand  growth. Some domestic production which uses imports as inputs might also be constrained if trade barriers cause  supply-chain disruption. …and in the long run. Lower trade can reduce productivity growth as businesses are less exposed to global competition and new ideas, less  able to exploit comparative advantages by specialising, and less able to benefit from economies of scale. Historically,  there has been a strong relationship between trade openness and output via productivity. A study by Feyrer (2009),  for example, suggests that a 20% reduction in trade flows tends to drag on output by around 5% in the long run. The  integration of global supply chains in recent decades may have intensified that link.  The impact may spill over to other countries. Countries that are not directly exposed to an increase in trade barriers might nonetheless feel some effect from their  imposition elsewhere. Some might benefit from positive ‘trade diversion’ effects if they produce close substitutes for  products supplied by those countries that become subject to tariffs. Most countries are likely to be negatively affected  by the reduction in global demand, however, particularly if they supply inputs for affected countries’ exports.  Spillovers could also occur via reduced business confidence and increased uncertainty. The introduction of trade  barriers may make businesses more uncertain about the potential market for their products and services, and whether  further protectionist policies will follow. That uncertainty is likely to reduce business investment, lowering the rate of  global capital accumulation and so supply growth.  Global financial conditions could also be affected. The price of companies’ equity or corporate bonds might fall, for  example, if investors expect trade barriers to reduce profitability or increase the risks around it. 3.2 Recent developments in trade policy The US-China trade war has led to a significant increase in bilateral tariffs… Tariffs on goods traded between the US and China have been increasing since mid-2018 (Table 3.A). At the time of  the August Report, the US had levied tariffs on a total of US$250 billion of imports from China, with China  implementing tariffs on US$110 billion of imports from the US in response.  …with further increases since the August Report. In September, US tariffs on a further US$112 billion of imports from China came into effect, and China responded with  measures applied to some goods on a US$75 billion target list of US imports. As a result, bilateral tariffs between the  US and China are estimated to be around 15 percentage points higher than at the start of 2018 (Chart 3.3). The initial  waves of US tariffs on Chinese imports were predominantly levied on industrial supplies and capital goods, but more  recent tariffs have affected a broader range of products, including consumer goods (Chart 3.4). The US had previously announced a further increase in tariffs from 25% to 30% on US$250 billion of imports from  China, but this increase was subsequently suspended. However, new 15% tariffs could still be introduced on almost all  remaining US imports from China in December. (1)	 In isolation, tariffs levied on imports would be expected to cause an appreciation of the exchange rate that would lower the impact on domestic prices. If another  country reciprocates, however, that would reduce the exchange rate effect so the result would be higher prices in both economies.  	 Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 3 In focus Trade protectionism and the global outlook   34 Other policies have also increased trade barriers. While there are some recent examples of measures that reduce trade barriers — the EU and Japan agreed a trade deal  which came into force in February for example — the number of protectionist measures introduced around the world  over the past couple of years has been much larger (Chart 3.5). Some of these have raised non-tariff barriers. Japan,  for example, has imposed restrictions on exports of certain raw materials to South Korea. Tariffs between countries  other than the US and China have also increased. The US introduced new tariffs on US$7.5 billion of imports from the  EU in October, following a long-running dispute over state subsidies to aircraft manufacturers.

The US administration is considering whether to impose  tariffs on imported automotive products. If imposed, these could lower exports to the US from a number of regions,  including the EU. Moreover, some previously proposed trade agreements which would have reduced trade barriers  — such as that between the EU and the South American trade bloc Mercosur — are now in doubt. …as the rationales for measures broaden. As trade measures have become more widespread, the stated aims of trade policies has broadened significantly.  Initially motivated by concerns over bilateral trade imbalances, trade measures are now being introduced in response  to a range of issues, including immigration, intellectual property protection and control of new technologies.  Protectionist measures could become more pervasive and persistent: over a third of respondents to a recent Bank of  America Merrill Lynch survey considered the US-China trade war to be the ‘new normal’ with no expectation that it  will be resolved.  3.3 The impact of trade policy measures to date  Trade between the US and China has fallen significantly since trade barriers increased…  US-China tariffs have increased the price of imported goods in both countries and that has weighed directly on import  growth. US imports from China fell by more than 10% in the year to 2019 Q2 and Chinese imports from the US were  around 25% down on a year earlier (Chart 3.6). …and evidence of trade diversion to other countries appears to be limited. Those sharp declines in US-China bilateral trade flows might have been expected to lead to a boost to trade  elsewhere as demand is diverted to other regions, but there has been little evidence of this so far. The rate of growth  of US imports from some Asian economies such as Vietnam and Cambodia has increased since mid-2018, but imports  from China are more than five times as large as from those countries combined. For most of the largest emerging  economies in Asia, growth of exports to the US has not risen to the same extent (Chart 3.7). That suggests that the  negative effect on those countries from disrupted supply chains may have more than offset any positive effect from  trade diversion.  Global trade and output growth have both been slowing… The increase in protectionism has led to a notable decline in global trade growth. World trade growth has fallen by  5½ percentage points over the past year (Chart 3.8), of which around 2½ percentage points is accounted for by lower  imports growth in the US and China. Alongside this lower global trade growth, global GDP growth has fallen by  1 percentage point.  40 30 20 10 0 10 20 30 40 2014 15 16 17 18 19 US imports  from China  Percentage changes on a year earlier Chinese imports  from the US US implements ﬁrst  China-speciﬁc tariffs  + – Chart 3.6 Bilateral trade between the US and China has  contracted sharply since tariffs were first introduced Import growth(a) Sources: IMF Direction of Trade Statistics and Bank calculations.

Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 3 In focus Trade protectionism and the global outlook   36 …but trade protectionism is only part of the story. Factors other than trade protectionism have also weighed on global output growth. These factors include a tightening  in financial conditions during 2018, particularly in emerging markets, as asset prices adjusted to tighter policy in the  US and China. Some country-specific factors caused particularly sharp slowdowns in countries such as Turkey and  Argentina. The ongoing slowdown in China has dragged on growth in countries that rely on Chinese demand for their  exports, such as Germany. The direct impact of new trade barriers introduced since mid-2018 is estimated to have been modest… The direct effect of increased protectionism on world GDP growth via trade flows, supply chains and import costs  appears to have been modest. That reflects the fact that tariffs to date have been largely contained to two countries.  A general equilibrium model of the global economy which simulates the direct effect of higher tariffs on global output  suggests that PPP-weighted global GDP is currently around 0.1% lower as a result of trade barriers introduced since  mid-2018 (Table 3.B).(2)   External estimates also suggest that the impact of US-China tariffs has been relatively small to date. A recent study by  Fajgelbaum et al (2019) found that US-China tariffs had reduced US GDP by just 0.04%. These estimates are sensitive  to the underlying assumptions, however, including the monetary policy response.(3)   …but the indirect effects on investment via reduced business confidence may have been larger. Growth is also likely to have been dampened by the decline in global business confidence and associated pickup in  uncertainty (Chart 3.2), which are likely to be related to the increase in trade protectionism. Surveys of investor  confidence have fallen since mid-2018, and are below their historical averages (Chart 3.9). In turn, four-quarter  business investment growth across G7 countries (excluding the UK) has slowed from around 6% to less than 2% over  the past year. Capital goods orders for the US and euro area continue to weaken. These confidence effects can also be seen in financial markets. On days where there has been news about protectionist  measures, US equity prices have tended to fall, while equity market volatility and risk premia have risen. That probably  reflects investors’ judgements that higher trade barriers will weigh on some companies’ profits. The market-implied  paths for interest rates have fallen significantly since mid-2018, in part reflecting expectations that looser monetary  policy will be required to offset the impact of protectionism on global demand.

There is a deep and long-standing literature establishing the link  between higher uncertainty and lower spending (Section 4), but uncertainty linked to trade policy is hard to measure.  Even if it were possible to represent trade policy uncertainty in one measure, its impact may not be well captured by  models based on past relationships. There are few past examples of a sudden escalation in trade tensions following a  long period of liberalisation.  To gauge the indirect effects of trade policy measures, Bank staff have estimated the impact of increased uncertainty  on US business investment. Results from this approach suggest that increased uncertainty will reduce the level of US  business investment by between 5% and 7%. Since China has also been directly affected by rises in tariffs, the effect  on investment is assumed to be similar there. Uncertainty is also assumed to weigh on investment in the euro area.  Businesses in some euro-area countries rely heavily on external demand and annual business investment growth has  fallen from around 4% in mid-2018 to around 2% in 2019 Q2. Overall, the indirect effects of protectionism are judged  to have reduced the level of PPP-weighted global output by 0.4% to date, somewhat larger than the direct effects  (Table 3.B). 3.4 The impact on the MPC’s forecasts Trade protectionism has contributed to lower-than-expected global output growth. The escalation in trade protectionism has contributed to the sharper-than-expected slowing in global growth  over the past year and a half. In May 2018 — before the start of the US-China trade war — the MPC projected  that PPP-weighted global growth would be around 3¾% in 2019 Q2. The outturn was 1 percentage point lower  than that forecast. Protectionism continues to weigh on the MPC’s latest projection for global output growth… The MPC expects trade protectionism and the associated increase in uncertainty to continue to weigh on global  growth over the forecast period. On top of the effects seen to date, it is expected to lower PPP-weighted global GDP  by a further 0.6%, such that protectionism is estimated to drag on global GDP by up to 1.1% in total (Table 3.B).  While trade protectionism continues to weigh on activity, global growth is projected to pick up a little during 2020.  That pickup is partly accounted for by a recovery in growth in some emerging economies which have been hit by  idiosyncratic shocks, for example in Turkey and Argentina. It is also supported by accommodative policies in the  US and euro area.  …and on the MPC’s projection for UK GDP growth.   Slow global growth is assumed to affect UK growth through trade channels. In addition, as in other countries,  the higher uncertainty and reduced confidence associated with trade tensions weighs on UK business investment  (Section 1).

Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 4 In focus Uncertainty and Brexit   38 4 In focus Uncertainty and Brexit  Uncertainty about future outcomes is an important driver of economic behaviour, over and  above central expectations. The Brexit process has already affected the UK economy. It has  made some firms and households more pessimistic about the central outlook. It has also  increased the uncertainty around that central outlook. Bank research suggests that these  Brexit effects have depressed investment spending and weighed on productivity. The  MPC’s latest projections assume that the progress of the Withdrawal Agreement removes  some uncertainty. But some is likely to persist while the deal and the transition to it are  negotiated. People’s expectations about the economic outlook are important for spending and investment decisions. For example,  people might spend less now if they think that their income is likely to be lower in future. In addition, there is a deep  and long-standing literature showing that the degree of uncertainty around those expectations also has an important  influence on behaviour. Higher uncertainty tends to weigh on investment and consumption (Chart 4.1), especially the  former, and can reduce productive capacity.   Brexit will fundamentally change the nature of the UK’s relationship with its largest trading partner. The wide range of  potential outcomes appears to have both increased uncertainty (Chart 4.2) and made people more pessimistic about  the economic outlook. Those effects, which are difficult to separate, are already influencing the UK economy. They  have lowered business investment in particular, and may have weighed on productivity and consumption. This section summarises how uncertainty can affect the economy in principle (Section 4.1). It then assesses the impact  of Brexit on indicators of uncertainty (Section 4.2) and how this has affected the UK economy (Section 4.3). Finally, it  sets out how uncertainty is assumed to evolve in the MPC’s forecast (Section 4.4).

Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 4 In focus Uncertainty and Brexit   39 4.1 The impact of uncertainty on the economy Economic behaviour is forward looking. When firms and households make decisions about investment and spending, they take the future into account. Their  central expectations about the economic outlook — what they think is most likely to happen — are important.  Uncertainty around those expectations also affects decisions being made now.   Uncertainty weighs on investment… Uncertainty creates a value in waiting for news that might make the future outlook clearer. This means firms are  more likely to delay investment decisions where the return will vary depending on how the economy evolves (see  Bernanke (1983) and Dixit and Pindyck (1994)). Investment typically involves sunk costs and changes to processes, for  example from installing a new production line. That makes it costly to reverse, and this irreversibility creates an  incentive to delay decisions until more is known about the future, protecting firms from bad outcomes. The value of  delaying is greater the worse the potential bad outcomes are.   The incentive to wait might be particularly strong if firms expect uncertainty to be resolved soon. Delaying investment  until uncertainty falls comes with a cost. Firms forego the potential profits from the investment while they wait. The  longer they wait, the higher the cost. Therefore delaying becomes more reasonable if uncertainty is expected to last  only a short time.(1)   …including through its influence on financial conditions… As uncertainty increases, investors are likely to demand a higher compensation for risk, causing credit conditions to  tighten (see Whaley (2000) and Gilchrist, Sim and Zakrajšek (2014)). This can lower spending as credit becomes less  readily available. But causality can also go the other way. A shock which tightens credit conditions can also lead to  heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook. That occurred during the financial crisis, for example. As a result,  it is important to separate the effect of changes in uncertainty from the effect of other shocks. In some of the  empirical research, the estimated impact of uncertainty on demand falls once the effect of changes in credit  conditions has been taken into account.(2)     …and can also reduce productivity and supply growth. If investment is delayed, it affects the amount firms can produce in future through lower capital deepening and  research and development (see Bonciani and Oh (2019)). Uncertainty can also cause firms to postpone hiring and  firing decisions and can make workers reluctant to seek new jobs. The resulting fall in labour market churn could lower  productivity if it results in labour being misallocated across firms (see Lazear and Spletzer (2012)).  Uncertainty might also affect consumption. Higher uncertainty can cause risk-averse households to cut back on consumption temporarily (see Leland (1968) and  Carroll (1997)). The literature suggests that uncertainty about job prospects is particularly important for household  behaviour, as it encourages precautionary saving (see Benito (2004)). Households might delay spending that involves  large costs, such as buying a house or car, similar to firms delaying investment. But because the majority of day-to-day  household spending does not involve large one-off costs, the effect of uncertainty on total consumption may be  smaller than for business investment. 4.2 The impact of Brexit on uncertainty Brexit has increased uncertainty. Brexit will fundamentally change the nature of the UK’s relationship with its largest trading partner. The impact of  Brexit on indicators of uncertainty has been evident since the referendum. At least 30% of firms have cited Brexit in  their top three sources of uncertainty in the Bank’s Decision Maker Panel (DMP) Survey since it began in 2016  (Chart 4.2). This has risen to around 55% of firms in more recent surveys. Brexit uncertainty has been widespread,  including for firms which are not reliant on sales to the EU (Chart 4.3). (1)	 This channel is covered in more detail in Broadbent, B (2019), ‘Investment and uncertainty: the value of waiting for news’.  (2)	 See Forbes, K (2016), ‘Uncertainty about uncertainty’.  	 Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 4 In focus Uncertainty and Brexit   40 This is reflected in some more general uncertainty indicators… As well as the DMP measure of Brexit-specific uncertainty (Chart 4.2), some indicators capturing general uncertainty  have risen too. For example, an above-average proportion of respondents to the Deloitte CFO Survey — more than half  — have reported high uncertainty in the past four quarters (Chart 4.4).   The implied volatility from sterling options — which captures perceived uncertainty around the exchange rate — has  been elevated recently (Chart 4.4). This measure is likely to capture both political and business cycle uncertainty. It is  suited to identifying UK-specific shocks, like Brexit, because the exchange rate reflects beliefs about relative economic  prospects. It also has a historically reliable relationship with UK business investment and GDP growth.  In contrast, some other uncertainty indicators are less elevated. The range in Chart 4.4 shows a broad set of measures,  summarised in a principal component.(3) The principal component is currently around its historical average. This might  be because some indicators do not capture Brexit uncertainty fully. For example, one measure is based on a range of  external forecasters’ central expectations for GDP growth. This might fail to pick up the degree of uncertainty that  each forecaster has around their central projection.   …which suggest uncertainty is close to post-crisis highs. Sterling implied volatility and uncertainty among CFOs rose substantially in the run-up to the Article 50 deadline in  March 2019 (Chart 4.4). The proportion of firms which place Brexit in their top three sources of uncertainty also  increased ahead of the March deadline and has remained elevated since (Chart 4.2). These measures suggest  uncertainty in 2019 Q3 was close to post-crisis highs. 4.3 How has Brexit uncertainty affected the economy? As well as increasing uncertainty, Brexit has made some households and firms more pessimistic… Brexit appears to have made households and businesses more pessimistic about the economy, on average. The  DMP Survey suggests that, on balance, firms expect that Brexit ultimately will have a negative impact on their sales  (Chart 4.5). Household expectations for the general economic situation a year ahead have deteriorated since 2016,  although confidence in their own financial situation has been less affected (Chart 2.18).   (3)	The principal component summarises the signals from the range of measures into the single variable that accounts for the greatest amount of covariation between  them.

It is difficult to disentangle the influence of higher uncertainty from the effects of increased pessimism. Both can have  similar effects on behaviour, weighing on consumption and investment. They have also moved together: the impact  that firms expect Brexit will have on their sales is highly correlated with their uncertainty about Brexit (Chart 4.6). As  a result, the estimated impact of Brexit uncertainty on the economy set out below might also be capturing some  effects from increased pessimism. Brexit has been a key factor in the stalling of business investment.  Heightened uncertainty has weighed on business investment in the UK. Over the past three years, cumulative growth  in investment spending has been just 0.4%. This could be partly explained by slowing global growth, but investment  has been weak even relative to other major advanced economies (Chart 2.15).   The biggest falls in investment growth have been by firms reporting high uncertainty about Brexit (Chart 4.7).  Recent research (set out in Bloom et al (2019)) suggests that the level of business investment was around 11% lower in  2019 Q2 as a result of Brexit (Chart 4.8). Business investment was still growing in the period soon after the referendum, albeit at a much slower rate than  before, but it has fallen in almost every quarter since 2018. This further weakening could be partly explained by firms  waiting to see if some uncertainty would be resolved by the March and October 2019 Brexit deadlines. Consumer spending has been less affected so far… Consumption has been more resilient than investment. While household expectations for the general economic  outlook have fallen, uncertainty about job prospects has been more stable (Chart 2.18), and this is one of the most  important channels through which uncertainty can affect spending. Spending has also been underpinned by real  income growth and accommodative credit conditions.  …but there have been some signs of uncertainty dampening consumption. There is some evidence that uncertainty has affected large purchases and discretionary spending by households. The  housing market has been subdued since 2016 (Chart 2.19). Surveys suggest this is at least partly due to Brexit, as  households delay purchases given the large costs involved. Uncertainty could also partly explain why car purchases  have been weak, although changes in emissions regulations have made recent data difficult to interpret. More broadly,  consumer spending that might be seen as non-essential(4) has risen by just 0.5% over the past year, the weakest  (4)	Spending excluding: most food and non-alcoholic beverages; housing, water and energy costs; repair of household appliances; non-durable household goods for  routine maintenance; dwelling and transport insurance; and financial services not elsewhere classified. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Large negative effect Small negative effect No impact Small positive effect Large positive effect Average probability, per cent Chart 4.5 On balance, firms expect Brexit to have a  negative effect on their sales Firms’ expected eventual impact of Brexit on sales(a) Sources: DMP Survey and Bank calculations.

In addition, the saving ratio and household financial balance have drifted up a little over the past  couple of years, which might suggest some precautionary saving. Uncertainty may also have affected supply capacity. Evidence from the DMP Survey suggests that the Brexit process has reduced the level of UK productivity by 2%.(5)  Most of this effect comes from reduced productivity within firms. This could be a result of firms preparing for Brexit,  which may have diverted resources away from productive output or making improvements. Firms with higher  uncertainty about Brexit have spent more resources on planning (Chart 4.9). Lower business investment due to  heightened uncertainty may have also weighed on labour productivity through reduced capital deepening.   (5)	 The research gives a range of 2%–5%. The estimate of 2% is calculated by weighting the results for each firm by its size, whereas 5% gives all firms equal weight.  For this reason, the aggregate effect on UK productivity is likely to be closer to 2%.

Monetary Policy Report November 2019   Section 4 In focus Uncertainty and Brexit   43 There may have also been a small effect on average productivity through changes in the relative growth rates between  firms. Firms which were more productive before the EU referendum tend to report higher uncertainty about Brexit  (Chart 4.10). The research suggests the Brexit process has weighed on the growth of more productive firms to a  greater extent. Exporters tend to be more productive and demand for exports might have fallen by more than for  domestic goods in response to Brexit. Intelligence from the Bank’s Agents suggests uncertainty has lowered export  demand, as some overseas customers are reluctant to enter new deals until there is greater clarity about future  trading arrangements (Box 3). 4.4 Uncertainty in the MPC’s forecast The MPC projects that some uncertainty will be removed in the near term… In October, the UK and EU agreed a Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration, and the UK House of Commons  approved the second reading of the Bill which implements the agreement into law. The UK’s EU membership was also  extended by up to a further three months. Those developments are likely to reduce the uncertainty that has been  facing households and businesses in the near term. In part that will reflect a lower perceived likelihood of a no-deal  Brexit. For example, betting odds suggest that the probability of a no-deal Brexit in 2019 has fallen markedly.  Responses to the DMP Survey also suggest that the average likelihood that firms attach to a no-deal Brexit in 2019 fell  after the second reading of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill was passed.   …though it remains somewhat elevated over the forecast period. Some uncertainty is likely to persist, however. Brexit is a process rather than a single event. While the agreement sets  out the broad parameters of the UK and EU’s future trading relationship, the range of potential outcomes is still  relatively wide. Most companies reported that uncertainty was high in Q3 (Chart 4.11). And the proportion of firms  expecting Brexit-related uncertainty to last until after next year has picked up recently (Chart 4.12). Uncertainty is  assumed to decline gradually over the forecast period, as the details of the UK and EU’s eventual relationship emerge  over time. The reduction in uncertainty supports the recovery in UK demand growth. As the dampening effect from Brexit-related uncertainties begins to dissipate, GDP growth is projected to pick up  moderately. The decline in uncertainty is assumed to support business investment in particular. Four-quarter business  investment growth is projected to rise from -11/2% in 2019 Q2 to around 4% in 2021 (Section 1).   0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Feb. Mar. Apr. May June July Aug. Sep. Oct.

Chart A On average, forecasters’ central projection for  GDP growth is a little below the MPC’s Projections for GDP Source: Projections of outside forecasters as of 25 October 2019. On average, external forecasters expect inflation to remain broadly stable over the next three years, at around 2%.  That is higher than the November Report forecast at the one-year horizon, but lower at three years (Chart B).

2020-08-06,"Monetary Policy Committee Monetary Policy Report August 2020  On 7 August, the third panel in Chart 2.18 was corrected. Missing data for 2023 were also added  to the May market path for policy rates in the euro area in Chart 2.7.           Monetary Policy Report  August 2020    Monetary policy at the Bank of England    The objectives of monetary policy  The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to keep inflation low and stable, which supports growth and  jobs. Subject to maintaining price stability, the MPC is also required to support the Government’s economic policy.  The Government has set the MPC a target for the 12-month increase in the Consumer Prices Index of 2%.    The 2% inflation target is symmetric and applies at all times.   The MPC’s remit recognises, however, that the actual inflation rate will depart from its target as a result of shocks and  disturbances, and that attempts to keep inflation at target in these circumstances may cause undesirable volatility in output. In  exceptional circumstances, the appropriate horizon for returning inflation to target can vary. The MPC will communicate how  and when it intends to return inflation to the target.    The instruments of monetary policy  The MPC currently uses two main monetary policy tools. First, we set the interest rate that banks and building societies earn on  deposits, or ‘reserves’, placed with the Bank of England — this is Bank Rate. Second, we can buy government and corporate  bonds, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves — this is asset purchases or quantitative easing.     The Monetary Policy Report  The MPC is committed to clear, transparent communication. The Monetary Policy Report (MPR) is a key part of that. It allows  the MPC to share its thinking and explain the reasons for its decisions.   The Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff under the guidance of the members of the MPC.   This Report has been prepared and published by the Bank of England in accordance with section 18 of the Bank of England   Act 1998.

In  that context, its challenge at present is to respond to the economic and financial impact  of the Covid-19 pandemic. At its meeting ending on 4 August 2020, the MPC voted  unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%. The Committee voted unanimously for the  Bank of England to continue with its existing programmes of UK government bond and  sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the  issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the total stock of these  purchases at £745 billion.  The Committee’s projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying August Monetary Policy  Report. Although recent developments suggest a less weak starting point for the Committee’s latest projections, it  is unclear how informative they are about how the economy will perform further out. The outlook for the UK and  global economies remains unusually uncertain. It will depend critically on the evolution of the pandemic, measures  taken to protect public health, and how governments, households and businesses respond to these factors. The  MPC’s projections assume that the direct impact of Covid-19 on the economy dissipates gradually over the forecast  period. Given the inherent uncertainties regarding the evolution of the pandemic, the MPC’s medium-term  projections are a less informative guide than usual.    Global activity has strengthened over recent months, although it generally remains below its level in 2019 Q4.  Covid-19 has continued to spread rapidly within a number of emerging market economies, however, and there has  been a renewed rise in cases in many advanced economies.    UK GDP is expected to have been over 20% lower in 2020 Q2 than in 2019 Q4. But higher-frequency indicators  imply that spending has recovered significantly since the trough in activity in April. Payments data suggest that  household consumption in July was less than 10% below its level at the start of the year. Housing market activity  appears to have returned to close to normal levels, despite signs of a tightening in credit supply for some  households. There is less evidence available on business spending, but surveys suggest that business investment is  likely to have fallen markedly in Q2 and investment intentions remain very weak.     Employment appears to have fallen since the Covid-19 outbreak, although this has been very significantly mitigated  by the extensive take-up of support from temporary government schemes. Surveys indicate that many workers  have already returned to work from furlough, but considerable uncertainty remains about the prospects for  employment after those support schemes unwind. In the near term, the unemployment rate is projected to rise  materially, to around 7½% by the end of the year, consistent with a material degree of spare capacity.    In the MPC’s central projection, GDP continues to recover beyond the near term, as social distancing eases and  consumer spending picks up further. Business investment also recovers, but somewhat more slowly.  Unemployment declines gradually from the beginning of 2021 onwards. Activity is supported by the substantial  fiscal and monetary policy actions in place. Nonetheless, the recovery in demand takes time as health concerns  drag on activity. GDP is not projected to exceed its level in 2019 Q4 until the end of 2021, in part reflecting  persistently weaker supply capacity. Given the scale of the movements in output, as well as the inherent  uncertainty over the factors determining the outlook, the evolution of the balance between demand and supply is  hard to assess. The MPC’s central projection implies that a margin of spare capacity is likely to remain until the end  of next year. The risks to the outlook for GDP are judged to be skewed to the downside.    Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Monetary Policy Summary   ii        Twelve-month CPI inflation increased to 0.6% in June from 0.5% in May. CPI inflation is expected to fall further  below the 2% target and average around ¼% in the latter part of the year, largely reflecting the direct and indirect  effects of Covid-19. These include the impact of energy prices and the temporary cut in VAT for hospitality, holiday  accommodation and attractions. As these effects unwind, inflation rises, supported by a gradual strengthening of  domestic price pressures as spare capacity diminishes. In the MPC’s central projection, conditioned on prevailing  market yields, CPI inflation is expected to be around 2% in two years’ time.    The Committee will continue to monitor the situation closely and stands ready to adjust monetary policy  accordingly to meet its remit. The MPC will keep under review the range of actions that could be taken to deliver its  objectives. The Committee does not intend to tighten monetary policy until there is clear evidence that significant  progress is being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably.     At this meeting, the Committee judges that the existing stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.   Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 1 The economic outlook   1        1 The economic outlook    The spread of Covid-19 and the actions to contain it have had a dramatic impact on the  UK and many countries around the world. Global activity fell sharply during the first few  months of 2020. Since then, output has recovered, but remains below levels at the start  of the year.  The outlook for the UK and global economies remains unusually uncertain. It will depend  critically on the evolution of the pandemic, measures taken to protect public health, and  how governments, households and businesses respond to these factors. The MPC’s  projections assume that the direct impact of Covid-19 on the economy dissipates  gradually over the forecast period. Conditional on that assumption, UK GDP is projected  to continue to recover over the forecast period. Activity is also supported by substantial  fiscal and monetary policy actions. Nonetheless, the recovery in demand takes time as  health concerns drag on activity. The risks are skewed to the downside.  The supply capacity of the economy has also fallen materially over the first half of the  year, and the balance between demand and supply is difficult to gauge. On balance,  there is judged to be a material degree of spare capacity at the moment. That is eroded  as activity picks up, before a margin of excess demand builds during the second half of  the forecast period.   CPI inflation is projected to remain well below the MPC’s 2% target in the near term,  largely reflecting the direct and indirect effects of Covid-19. These include the temporary  impact of lower energy prices and cut in VAT, as well as downward pressure from spare  capacity in the economy. As these effects wane, inflation rises. In the central projection,  inflation is projected to be around 2% in two years’ time.  1.1 Recent developments    Activity around the world — including in the UK — fell sharply over March and April, as social distancing  affected spending…   The spread of Covid-19 and the social distancing to control it have restricted economic activity across a wide range  of countries. Bank staff estimate that UK-weighted world GDP fell by around 12% over the first half of the year.  That fall, while very substantial, is materially less sharp than was the case in the illustrative scenario in the May  Report. That reflects restrictions being eased sooner than assumed and, even while some restrictions remained in  place, a more rapid recovery in consumer spending.    The timing and magnitude of the falls in activity have varied across countries, partly reflecting differences in the  spread of the virus and lockdown measures, including when they began to be eased. The variation is also likely to  reflect differences in the structure of economies, such as the amount of spending that involves interactions with  other people. That has been particularly affected by Covid-19, as social distancing measures have been introduced  and as people’s health concerns have risen. In the UK, relative to some other countries, lockdown measures were   Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 1 The economic outlook   2        eased later and the proportion of spending involving high degrees of social interactions is bigger in normal times. As  a result, the impact of Covid-19 on UK activity has been relatively large. UK GDP is expected to have been 23%  lower in 2020 Q2 relative to 2019 Q4.    …but it has recovered somewhat since then.  Indicators of activity have recovered in many countries over the past few months, although they generally remain  below their pre-Covid levels (Section 2.1). In the UK, GDP rose in May. Higher-frequency indicators suggest that  spending has recovered further since then. For example, indicators from payments data suggest that consumer  spending in July was, in aggregate, no more than 10% below its level at the start of the year, after falling to around  30%–40% below it early in the lockdown.    The recovery in the UK has been earlier and more rapid than was assumed in the illustrative scenario in  the May Report…  The recovery in UK output has been somewhat more rapid than was assumed in the MPC’s illustrative scenario in  the May Report. That partly reflects lockdown measures being eased earlier than had been assumed. It also reflects  activity having been stronger than assumed under lockdown, partly due to greater online spending.     …but it has not been evenly distributed across the economy.  Some aspects of consumer spending have recovered rapidly. For example, spending that can be delayed —  including on items such as clothing, household furnishings and other larger items — fell sharply after restrictions  were introduced, but has since returned to close to pre-Covid levels at the start of the year (Section 2.3). In  addition, spending on staples, such as on food and household energy, has remained above pre-Covid levels for  most of the period since May. Reflecting those developments, retail sales have risen sharply since April, and in June  were close to their pre-Covid levels.    In contrast, other spending has remained subdued. Household spending that involves high levels of interactions  with others fell the furthest and has recovered only partially from its lows. Evidence from surveys also suggests that  business investment has remained weak. For example, respondents to the DMP Survey in July reported that they  would spend around 30% less than previously expected on investment in Q2.    In part, those differences reflect the impact of measures introduced by the Government to slow the spread of the  virus, which affected household spending related to social interactions the most. They are also likely to reflect the  impact of consumer and business confidence, as well as uncertainty about the outlook. Elevated concerns about  health risks are likely to constrain households’ social interactions. And heightened business uncertainty about the  economic outlook can weigh heavily on investment, as it increases the incentive to postpone projects until more  clarity emerges (see Section 4 of the November 2019 Report for more detail). The effect of uncertainty on  investment spending is likely to have been compounded by the need for businesses to conserve cash flow in the  face of sharp falls in sales.     The reduction in activity has resulted in lower employment, although government policies have  significantly limited the number of job losses.  In aggregate, consumer spending has fallen by much more than household incomes. Incomes and employment  have been supported by government measures — such as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) and  Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) — which have been widely used. Over 9 million jobs were  furloughed at some point under the CJRS, with Bank staff estimating that the peak number of employees on  furlough was over 7 million in May. Bank staff estimate that around 6 million employees were furloughed on  average during Q2, broadly in line with the assumption embodied in the May Report scenario. For those furloughed  employees, the Government initially paid 80% of their income, up to £2,500 per month. Bank staff estimate that  furloughed employees received 85% of their usual pay on average in Q2, a greater proportion than previously  assumed, as the Government’s contribution was topped up by some employers. In addition, around 80% of eligible  self-employed workers made use of the SEISS, which corresponds to over 2½ million total claims.    Despite having been supported by the CJRS and SEISS, employment has fallen since the Covid-19 outbreak. There is  a lot of uncertainty about the exact magnitude of the decline in employment, with different data sources providing  substantially different estimates. Based on a range of evidence, Bank staff expect total employment to have fallen   Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 1 The economic outlook   3        in Q2 as a whole, although by much less than output (Section 2.4). Lower employment, alongside a reduction in  hours by others remaining in work — including by employees on the furlough scheme — has resulted in a sharp fall  in hours worked (Section 3).    Bank staff estimate that unemployment has increased. While LFS data suggest that unemployment was little  changed in the three months to May, alternative sources suggest that it has begun to rise, although it appears to  have increased by substantially less than in the illustrative scenario in the May Report. In addition, lockdown  measures, including school closures, mean that some people who have lost their jobs are likely to have not been  actively searching for a job, or have not been available to start work. As a result, the proportion of the population  classed as inactive has also increased.      The supply capacity of the economy has fallen, as businesses have shut and employees have been  furloughed.   While demand has fallen sharply over the first half of the year, the supply of goods and services has also declined  materially. Many businesses closed: around a quarter of companies reported being temporarily closed in early  April, with 7% reporting that they remained closed in July. Others have temporarily reduced production and  furloughed employees. And some companies have had to adjust working practices — reflecting more working from  home, or to accommodate social distancing guidelines, for example — which might have weighed on productivity.    Nonetheless, there is judged to be spare capacity in the economy.   Notwithstanding these effects on supply, the MPC assesses that the contraction in demand is likely to have resulted  in a material amount of additional spare capacity in the UK economy. The MPC judges that there is less slack than  was assumed in the scenario in the May Report, however. Activity has fallen by somewhat less over the first half of  the year than in the illustrative scenario, although a similar number of employees have been furloughed. Less slack  is also consistent with the smaller rise in unemployment than was in the scenario.    The precise extent of spare capacity is highly uncertain, though. There will also be significant variation in the degree  of spare capacity across different sectors and firms (Section 4).    Inflation has been very weak, largely reflecting the direct and indirect effects of Covid-19.   Spare capacity will have exerted some downward pressure on domestic prices. Wage growth has been significantly  affected by the impact of the CJRS. Underlying wage growth is likely to have weakened. There is evidence from the  Bank’s Agents that wage pressures are muted.     In addition, CPI inflation has been affected by lower energy prices, as oil prices fell markedly in response to the fall  in global GDP. That accounts for a large part of the fall in inflation from 1.7% in Q1 to 0.6% in Q2.     1.2 The MPC’s projections    Table 1.A Forecast summary(a)(b)      (a) Modal projections for GDP, CPI inflation, LFS unemployment and excess supply/excess demand.

Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 1 The economic outlook   4        Uncertainty is currently elevated, reflecting concerns about the impact of Covid-19. The MPC’s projections  assume that it dissipates gradually over the forecast period.  The outlook for the economy is highly uncertain. It is dependent on the evolution of the pandemic and the  measures taken to protect public health. Equally, it will depend on how governments, households, businesses and  financial markets respond to those developments. In the MPC’s projections, it is assumed that the current shock  has resulted in heightened uncertainty about the outlook for both health and the economy. That is consistent with  a range of evidence from businesses and households. In the UK, three quarters of businesses responding to the  DMP Survey reported that overall uncertainty was high or very high in July, compared to around 40% before  Covid-19 restrictions were introduced. Survey indicators suggest that households remain cautious overall, with  GfK/EC consumer confidence remaining well below its historical average in July. And an ONS survey suggests that  substantial proportions of adults would feel uncomfortable about some social activities, such as going to the  cinema or eating indoors at a restaurant, at present (Section 2.3).     Over time, that uncertainty is assumed to wane, but only gradually. The path for uncertainty is consistent with  improved treatments or other health interventions becoming available. Over the forecast period, those  developments are assumed to reduce the health and economic risks facing households and businesses. As a result,  the direct effects of the pandemic on the economy are assumed to fade. For example, households are assumed to  increase their social interactions gradually over the first half of the forecast period. Nonetheless, the pandemic has  a longer-lasting impact on both the demand and supply sides of the economy, through lower capital accumulation,  higher labour market mismatch and other scarring effects (Key Judgement 2).    The proportion of employees furloughed from their jobs is assumed to decline, with most re-employed.  Government support measures are assumed to evolve in line with government policy. The CJRS is unwound.  Employers are liable for employees’ National Insurance and pension contributions from August, and will need to  contribute at least 10% of their salary in September and 20% in October, with the scheme closing at the end of  October.    Surveys indicate that some workers have already returned to work from furlough, and that companies expect the  proportion of employees on furlough to continue to drop in the near term (Section 3). The central projections  assume that around 2 million employees are furloughed in Q3 on average and around 1 million are furloughed in  October. In line with evidence from surveys, most workers are judged likely to return to work at their employer as  demand recovers, although some jobs are lost.    Fiscal policy actions support spending…  Since the start of the year, the Government has increased spending materially to support the economy. In its  Summer Economic Update in July, the Government announced a Job Retention Bonus of £1,000 for each previously  furloughed employee still employed by 31 January 2021, alongside other schemes to support jobs. It also  announced a temporary cut in VAT for hospitality and accommodation and a temporary increase in the Stamp Duty  threshold. In addition, government spending was increased. Taken together, these measures boost activity  substantially over the forecast period.    …as does monetary policy.  In June, the MPC announced that it would increase the target stock of purchased UK government bonds, financed  by the issuance of central bank reserves, by £100 billion, to take the total stock of asset purchases to £745 billion.  The MPC’s forecast is conditioned on the market path for interest rates, which has fallen over the past three  months, and averages close to zero over the forecast period (Table 1.A).1 The sterling exchange rate has  depreciated by around 1¾% over the past three months.     UK financial conditions have eased over the past three months, although they remain somewhat tighter  than at the start of the year.  Globally, risky asset prices fell sharply over the first few months of the year. Since then, those moves have  unwound somewhat, with equity prices rising and corporate bond spreads falling. Movements in UK asset prices    1   The forecast assumes that the transmission mechanism for changes in Bank Rate implied by the market path for interest rates is as usual. There could be risks  around that (see Box 1).   Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 1 The economic outlook   5        have broadly mirrored global developments, although the rise in UK equity prices over recent months has been  somewhat less than in other advanced economies. The improvements in financial market conditions have  supported credit supply conditions to companies since May, as have government-backed lending schemes.  However, credit conditions for households have tightened somewhat, with the Bank’s Credit Conditions Survey  suggesting that the availability of both secured and unsecured borrowing has fallen.    Overall, UK financial conditions have eased somewhat since the May Report, although they remain tighter than in  January. Credit conditions are assumed to remain tighter over the forecast period than was projected before the  Covid-19 shock.    The MPC’s central projections are conditioned on the assumption that there is an immediate but orderly  move to a comprehensive free trade agreement with the EU on 1 January 2021.  Consistent with government policy, and as in previous Reports, the MPC’s central projections assume that there is  an immediate but orderly move to a comprehensive free trade agreement between the UK and the EU on  1 January 2021. Some restrictions on trade between the UK and EU are assumed to come into place at that point as  the UK leaves the EU’s Single Market and Customs Union.       The UK Government has stated that it would be willing to trade with the EU without a free trade agreement, should  such an agreement not be reached. This would involve the introduction of tariffs on some goods traded with the EU  and, relative to the central case, greater non-tariff barriers to trade, such as more onerous border checks or higher  regulatory barriers. The possibility of an orderly transition to such trading arrangements, in line with government  policy, is therefore included in the fan charts.     Global GDP growth  Global GDP is projected to continue to recover as restrictions ease and policy remains supportive…  Following a sharp fall in the first half of the year, global GDP picks up in 2020 H2. Indicators of activity have already  begun to recover in many countries as social distancing measures have been eased, and the recovery is projected  to continue in the near term. Thereafter, spending is continued to be supported by the dissipation of uncertainty  about both health and the economy and the very large policy responses that have been put in place. The profile of  the recoveries in spending vary across countries, reflecting differences in public health and associated actions to  control the spread of Covid-19, as well as the magnitude of policy responses. For example, the recovery in the US is  assumed to be a little slower as a result of the increase in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks.    …although activity is dampened by scarring effects.  While global activity rises over the next three years, the MPC judges that some longer-lasting effects will dampen  output over the forecast period. Weaker business investment is likely to weigh on the growth of the capital stock,  and could reduce productivity growth via lower research and development spending. Moreover, unemployment is  expected to remain elevated.     In the central forecast, PPP-weighted world growth falls sharply from 3% in 2019 to -5% in 2020. It increases  strongly in 2021 — to 7½% — reflecting the recovery in activity, before growing by 5% in 2022. Weighted by UK  export shares, world GDP growth falls from 1¾% in 2019 to -6¼% in 2020. It recovers to 6% in 2021 and is around  4¼% in 2022 (Table 1.C).    UK GDP growth  UK GDP also continues to pick up…  Spending in the UK is projected to rise relatively rapidly over the second half of the year (Chart 1.1), consistent with  recent developments in high-frequency indicators. Further out, the pace of the recovery slows. However, activity  continues to pick up, supported by the assumption that heightened uncertainty about the outlook for both health  and the economy wanes gradually over time. That leads to further rises in consumer spending on social activities.  The significant increase in fiscal spending and the accommodative stance of monetary policy also support demand.  At the end of this year, GDP is projected to be 5% below its level a year earlier. There is higher uncertainty than  usual around the outlook for unemployment. It is forecast to rise to around 7½% in Q4, before gradually declining.     Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 1 The economic outlook   6        …although the gradual decline in uncertainty means that the recovery takes time…  Over 2021, spending remains weaker than it would have been in the absence of Covid-19. Uncertainty is assumed  to fade gradually, so it continues to dampen spending. Tighter financial conditions also weigh on output. In the  MPC’s central projection, GDP does not exceed its level in 2019 Q4 until the end of 2021. Over 2021, GDP is, on  average, more than 3% weaker than in the MPC’s January forecast.    The recovery in GDP is accounted for mainly by household consumption — partly as spending on social activities  increases — and government spending. Business investment also picks up, but the level of investment spending  remains subdued for longer than consumer spending, as the effects of uncertainty and financial conditions are  more marked. Net trade drags on growth somewhat on average over the forecast period.    …and some effects weigh on output persistently.  The Covid-19 shock has a persistent effect on output, via its impact on the supply capacity of the economy. Lower  investment weighs on the productive capacity of the economy over time. It also reduces innovation, dampening  productivity growth. Tighter credit conditions impair productivity by reducing how efficiently capital is allocated  across the economy. Consequently, the supply capacity of the economy is around 1½% lower than it would have  been in the absence of Covid-19 by the end of the forecast period.     Chart 1.1 GDP projection based on market interest rate  expectations, other policy measures as announced      The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for GDP. It has been conditioned on the  assumptions in Table 1.A footnote (b). To the left of the vertical dashed line, the distribution  reflects uncertainty around revisions to the data over the past. To aid comparability with the  official data, it does not include the backcast for expected revisions, which is available from the  ‘Download the chart slides and data’ link at www.bankofengland.co.uk/report/2020/monetary- policy-report-financial-stability-report-august-2020. To the right of the vertical line, the  distribution reflects uncertainty over the evolution of GDP in the future. If economic circumstances  identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that  the mature estimate of GDP would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of those  occasions. The fan chart is constructed so that outturns are also expected to lie within each pair of  the lighter green areas on 30 occasions. In any particular quarter of the forecast period, GDP is  therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fan on 90 out of 100 occasions. And on the  remaining 10 out of 100 occasions GDP can fall anywhere outside the green area of the fan chart.  Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey background. See the box on page  39 of the November 2007 Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it  represents.    Chart 1.2 Unemployment projection based on market  interest rate expectations, other policy measures as  announced      The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for LFS unemployment. It has been  conditioned on the assumptions in Table 1.A footnote (b). The coloured bands have the same  interpretation as in Chart 1.1, and portray 90% of the probability distribution. The calibration of  this fan chart takes account of the likely path dependency of the economy, where, for example, it  is judged that shocks to unemployment in one quarter will continue to have some effect on  unemployment in successive quarters. The fan begins in 2020 Q2, a quarter earlier than the fan for  CPI inflation. That is because Q2 is a staff projection for the unemployment rate, based in part on  data for April and May. The unemployment rate was 3.9% in the three months to May, and is  projected to be 4.1% in Q2 as a whole. A significant proportion of this distribution lies below Bank  staff’s current estimate of the long-term equilibrium unemployment rate. There is therefore  uncertainty about the precise calibration of this fan chart.    Excess supply/demand  Unemployment increases over 2020 H2, and declines only gradually.  The MPC judges that the weakness of activity in the second half of 2020 is likely to continue to be reflected in a  material amount of spare capacity in the economy. In particular, the rise in unemployment is reflected in slack in  the labour market.    Labour market slack persists over the first half of the forecast period, as unemployment is judged likely to decline  only gradually after peaking in Q4 (Chart 1.2). The gradual decline in part reflects an expectation that hiring will  pick up relatively slowly, consistent with uncertainty affecting companies’ demand for labour. In addition, the MPC  judges that there is likely to be some reduction in the efficiency with which people can find jobs. That tends to  happen as unemployment rises, as some people take time to find new jobs, and their skills erode. Moreover, in the  present conjuncture, the dispersed effects of Covid-19 on economic activity across sectors are judged to be likely to  result in a greater degree of mismatch than usual, given differences between the sectors from which workers have   Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 1 The economic outlook   7        been made unemployed and the sectors in which firms are posting vacancies. While the increase in labour market  mismatch slows the pace of the decline in unemployment, it also leads to a rise in the medium-term equilibrium  rate of unemployment, such that not all of the increase in unemployment reflects labour market slack. The  long-term equilibrium rate of unemployment is not assumed to rise, however.    Slack is eroded as demand recovers, and excess demand builds over the second half of the forecast  period.  Over the third year of the forecast period, the unemployment rate declines below its medium-term equilibrium  rate, and excess demand builds.    CPI inflation  CPI inflation is very low over the rest of 2020, reflecting the impact of temporary factors…  After declining sharply to 0.6% in Q2, CPI inflation is expected to fall somewhat further below the MPC’s 2% target  over the second half of 2020. Lower energy prices continue to weigh on inflation over coming months. In addition,  the Government’s announced cut to VAT will act as a drag on inflation over the second half of the year.    …but it returns to the target as those effects fade and as domestic price pressures pick up.  Slack in the economy dampens domestic price pressures over the first half of the forecast period. However, the  MPC continues to judge that it is likely that, while demand is especially weak, inflation will be affected by a little  less than usual for a given degree of spare capacity. That judgement partly reflects research on price‑setting which  finds that firms are less able to increase demand for their goods and services by reducing prices when demand is  low (Section 4). As demand picks up in the scenario, prices become more responsive again.    Inflation rises during 2021 (Chart 1.3), as the impacts of energy and the VAT cut fade. As excess demand builds over  the second half of the forecast period, domestic price pressures rise. In 2022 Q3, in the central projection, CPI  inflation is 2.0%. It is then projected to rise slightly above the target.      Chart 1.3 CPI inflation projection based on market  interest rate expectations, other policy measures as  announced      The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for CPI inflation in the future. It has been  conditioned on the assumptions in Table 1.A footnote (b). If economic circumstances identical to  today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that inflation in  any particular quarter would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of those occasions. The  fan chart is constructed so that outturns of inflation are also expected to lie within each pair of the  lighter red areas on 30 occasions. In any particular quarter of the forecast period, inflation is  therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fans on 90 out of 100 occasions. And on the  remaining 10 out of 100 occasions inflation can fall anywhere outside the red area of the fan chart.  Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey background. See the box on  pages 48–49 of the May 2002 Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it  represents.    Chart 1.4 Stylised representation of the MPC’s views on  uncertainty and risks around the central projection for  GDP         Policy decision  At its meeting ending on 4 August 2020, the MPC judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remained  appropriate. The MPC voted to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1% and for the Bank of England to continue with its existing  programmes of UK government bond and sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases,  financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the total stock of these purchases at   Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 1 The economic outlook   8        £745 billion. The factors behind that decision are set out in the Monetary Policy Summary on pages i–ii of this  Report and in more detail in the Minutes of the meeting.    1.3 Key judgements and risks    As reflected in the fan charts, uncertainty around the MPC’s central projections is unusually high…  The MPC’s forecast fan charts are wider than usual, reflecting the unusually high uncertainty about the outlooks for  the UK and global economies. That is consistent with the MPC’s conditioning assumption that the current shock has  resulted in elevated uncertainty for households and businesses about the outlook for both health and the  economy. The uncertainty around the central projections fades a little over time (Chart 1.4), as the health and  economic risks fade.    …and the risks are judged to be skewed to the downside.  The MPC judges that the risks to the path for uncertainty in the forecast are skewed towards the downside for  activity. As a consequence, the risks around the associated key judgements are also skewed to the downside. For  example, greater concerns about health outcomes would be likely to result in less social spending by households. It  could also result in greater long-lasting effects on the supply side of the economy.    Key judgement 1: as uncertainty dissipates gradually, household spending recovers.    Consumer spending will be affected by health risks.  The MPC’s projected recoveries in GDP both in the UK and globally depend importantly on the judgement that  uncertainty about health risks gradually declines. Recent studies of consumer spending over the past few months  suggest that social spending has been reduced by a ‘fear factor’ associated with health risks, rather than just  lockdown measures which constrain spending (for example, Goolsbee and Syverson (2020) and Chetty et al (2020)).    Given that health concerns are assumed to fade gradually in the forecast, consumer spending around the world —  particularly on social activities — should pick up. Households’ health concerns could fade more rapidly if the risks  from the virus diminish more rapidly than currently expected. As noted above, however, the MPC judges that the  risks around that assumption are probably skewed to the downside.     Some households might opt to hold a greater stock of precautionary savings to guard against the risk of  loss of income, posing a downside risk to spending.  In addition to health risks, household spending may also be dampened by concerns about the economic outlook. In  particular, saving tends to be sensitive to people’s perceived job security, which is often related to the outlook for  unemployment. Based on historical relationships, the recent sharp rise in the saving rate in the UK resulting from  the sharper fall in consumption than real incomes should provide households in aggregate with a sufficient stock of  such precautionary savings, given the projected rise in unemployment. And the saving rate is projected to remain  somewhat elevated as unemployment falls back. However, the rise in savings has not been equally distributed  across households. In particular, higher savings appear to have been concentrated in high-income households (see  Box 3). As a result, lower and middle-income households that have not accumulated a significant buffer might want  to save more as the unemployment rate rises. That is judged to pose a downside risk to UK consumer spending  over the next year or so.    While the potential desire of some households to run down ‘involuntary’ savings poses an upside risk to  spending…  The accumulation of savings by higher income households is likely to pose an upside risk to UK consumer spending,  however. Given that some of the accumulation of savings is likely to be an involuntary result of lockdown  measures, spending by these households could pick up sharply if they choose to run them down. For example, they  may choose to substitute spending on other goods and services for social spending.    …the MPC judges that overall risks to demand are skewed to the downside.  The risks resulting from changes in saving behaviour can be sizable. For example, in stylised illustrations,  UK household and corporate saving rates being temporarily 2 percentage points higher or lower have large,   Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 1 The economic outlook   9        immediate impacts on UK activity — of around 1% of annual GDP lower or higher, respectively.2 While there are  risks on both sides of the central projections, the MPC judges that the risks around the world and UK demand  projections are skewed to the downside.     Key judgement 2: there is some long-lasting scarring, largely due to persistent weakness in  productivity.    There is uncertainty about the speed of the recovery from the Covid-19 shock.  The extent to which activity recovers over the forecast period will depend on the operation of channels which can  increase the persistence of downturns. The nature of the Covid-19 shock, as well as the policies put in place to help  support households and businesses, might be expected to result in a relatively rapid recovery. Nonetheless, GDP in  many countries is persistently lower in the MPC’s central projections than it would have been in the absence of the  shock. In the UK, the supply capacity of the economy is projected to be around 1½% lower by the end of the  forecast period, largely due to weaker productivity.    Investment and productivity will be affected by the entry and exit of firms…  Investment and productivity will be affected by the degree to which new firms are formed and other firms exit the  market. In the UK, new firms tend to account for an outsize proportion of investment as they grow, so a shortfall in  young firms would dampen the recovery in investment, although higher firm entry usually initially exerts a drag on  productivity growth due to the lower productivity level of new entrants. An increase in firms exiting the market  could potentially raise capital scrapping, which would weigh on productivity. But, offsetting that effect, firms which  do exit typically have lower productivity rates than surviving firms, so higher exit could boost average productivity.3  These channels are judged likely to pose two-sided risks to the outlook for productivity.    …as will hiring, which will also be affected by the extent of labour market mismatch.  Bank staff analysis of the recovery of the UK from the financial crisis has found that the persistence of  unemployment over that period was in large part due to a slow recovery in the flow of workers from  unemployment to employment (Section 3). Hiring by firms picks up over the forecast in the MPC’s central  projection. It could pick up more rapidly if companies substitute towards labour and away from capital in an  environment of high uncertainty, as the fixed costs associated with capital spending can be higher than those for  labour, particularly for lower-skilled workers. The nature of uncertainty related to the pandemic — in particular,  concerns about public health — could make companies more uncertain than usual about their hiring plans,  however. Alternatively, hiring could recover more gradually than in the central case because of a greater degree of  labour market mismatch than has been assumed. While the MPC’s central projection embodies an assumption that  there is likely to be some reduction in the efficiency with which people can find jobs over the forecast period, the  Covid-19 shock could lead to a more substantial reduction if it results in significant longer-lasting changes to the  structure of economies. Those changes could make it harder for those who become unemployed to find new work  in a different sector. That would lead to a slower decline of unemployment, and a greater pickup in the  medium-term equilibrium rate of unemployment, than is assumed in the central projections.    The risks around activity in the medium term are also judged to be weighted somewhat to the downside.  The downside risk to activity from uncertainty is likely to translate into downside risks to GDP over the medium  term. In particular, uncertainty can weigh on decisions which incur fixed costs for firms, such as investment and  hiring. Slower recoveries in investment and hiring could also weigh on the supply capacity of the economy through  their spillover effects on productivity growth and labour market mismatch. The downside skew to activity in the  medium term is judged to be somewhat lower than in the near term, however.         2  In the stylised illustrations, shown in the May 2020 Monetary Policy Report, the consumption and business investment impacts are calibrated to deliver  household and corporate saving rates being 2 percentage points higher/lower for one quarter before unwinding over the subsequent 12 quarters. The effect on  activity is the impact on GDP over the three months following the change, expressed as a proportion of annual GDP in 2019, to abstract from recent sharp  changes in GDP.  3  This analysis was produced using statistical data from ONS.

Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 1 The economic outlook   10        Key judgement 3: inflation is weak in the near term, but it returns to the target as the drag from  temporary Covid-related factors wanes and spare capacity is eroded.    In the near term, there are risks around the extent to which the cut in VAT is passed through to prices.  CPI inflation is projected to fall a little further over the second half of the year, in part reflecting the impact of the  Government’s cut to VAT for some goods and services. The MPC’s projections assume that 50% of the cut in VAT is  initially passed through to consumer prices, with that effect fading over time. But there are risks around that  assumption.     The outlook for CPI inflation will be influenced by the sectoral dispersion of the shock to activity.  Throughout the forecast period, CPI inflation will be affected by the extent of spare capacity, and the distribution of  that spare capacity across sectors. The effects of the pandemic have fallen unevenly across sectors. Those  differences may interact with other differences — such as the frequency with which prices are changed, or the mix  of inputs used in production — to alter how any spare capacity affects inflation. Bank staff analysis suggests that  the hit to output arising from Covid-19 has been concentrated in highly consumer facing services, which tend to  exhibit higher price stickiness than the average CPI basket. As a result, any spare capacity might have a smaller  downward effect on CPI inflation than is usually assumed, consistent with the judgement underlying the MPC’s  central projection.    Cost pressures are also likely to vary across sectors. In the DMP Survey, the accommodation, food, and recreational  services sectors reported being most likely to have significantly higher costs resulting from Covid-19. Those sectors  also tend to have a relatively high proportion of their costs accounted for by labour, however, which might result in  decreased cost pressures as wage growth falls in response to labour market slack.     The risks around CPI inflation are judged to be to the downside.  These risks are judged to be relatively broadly balanced. Nevertheless, the risks to the MPC’s inflation projection  are skewed to the downside, particularly in the near term, reflecting the downside risks to the outlook for demand.  As a result, the mean projection for CPI inflation is a little below the MPC’s modal projection (Table 1.B).    Table 1.B CPI inflation projection    The table shows four-quarter CPI inflation rate projections. The projections are conditioned on the assumptions in Table 1.A footnote (b).    1.4 Constant rate projections    In the MPC’s projections conditioned on the alternative assumption of constant interest rates at 0.1%,4 activity is  still projected to recover over the forecast period, although it is slightly weaker. As a result, excess demand builds  to a somewhat lesser extent, and CPI inflation is projected to be a little lower.        4  The assumption is that Bank Rate remains at 0.1% throughout the three years of the forecast period, before moving towards the market path over the  subsequent three years.

Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 1 The economic outlook   12        Box 1  Negative policy rates  Since the financial crisis, nominal interest rates in the UK and elsewhere have reached historically low levels. As  that has happened, central banks have had to make judgements about the ‘effective lower bound’ (ELB) for their  respective policy rates — the point at which further cuts in the policy rate no longer provide stimulus or at which  adverse effects, such as in the financial sector, can arise. Some central banks have judged their ELB to be below  zero, and have implemented negative policy rates as a tool to stimulate the economy. In recent years, the MPC has  judged that the ELB for Bank Rate is close to but just above zero. But that judgement can change, and in the past  has changed. As a result, the MPC regularly reviews evidence about whether cutting interest rates further could  provide stimulus to the economy in an effective way, including comparing it with other policy tools — for example,  asset purchases and forward guidance.    The MPC is currently considering whether the ELB for Bank Rate could be below zero; that is whether a negative  policy rate could provide economic stimulus. The effectiveness of a negative policy rate will depend, in part, on the  structure of the financial system and how the policy transmits through banks to the interest rates facing  households and companies. It will also depend on the financial and economic conditions at the time. The MPC will  continue to keep under review the appropriateness of a negative policy rate alongside all of its policy tools.    This box sets out the potential issues that a negative policy rate could raise and how these could impact the  effectiveness of negative rates as a monetary policy tool.     Why have central banks considered using negative policy rates and how do they work?  Over the past 12 years, the traditional tool of monetary policy — the central bank interest rate — has  fallen to very low levels, in response to structural changes and economic shocks…   The global fall in central bank interest rates to very low levels in part reflects falls in the ‘equilibrium interest rate’  — the interest rate at which monetary policy is neither expansionary nor contractionary. The equilibrium interest  rate has fallen to very low levels over the past few decades across advanced economies. Much of that fall can be  explained by structural factors such as an ageing global population and declining trend productivity growth (see  Box 6 of the August 2018 Inflation Report). Alongside that, since the global financial crisis, central banks in the UK  and other countries have had to lower policy rates below the equilibrium rate to provide stimulus in response to  headwinds to growth and inflation.    …but the central bank interest rate is constrained by an ‘effective lower bound’.   The ‘effective lower bound’ (ELB) for policy rates is the level below which it is judged that macroeconomic stimulus  is no longer provided, or that adverse effects, such as in the financial sector, outweigh any possible macroeconomic  benefit. Since the financial crisis, many central banks — including the Bank of England — have used other monetary  policy tools — such as asset purchases and forward guidance — to boost their economies as the policy rate was  judged to be at or close to the ELB.    Different central banks have lowered their policy rates to different extents.  Judgements about the ELB vary across time and across central banks. Since the financial crisis, several central banks  have judged that the ELB was below zero and introduced negative policy rates. For example, the Danish National  Bank cut rates to below zero in 2012, as did the ECB in 2014, the Swedish Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank in  2015 and the Bank of Japan in 2016. For some other central banks, the ELB has been judged to be higher and lie  above zero. Judgements about the ELB can reflect different circumstances across countries as well as different  structural features, including differences in financial systems.    The MPC has judged in the recent past that the effective lower bound for Bank Rate was close to but  slightly above zero. But the factors determining this level can change over time.  The MPC keeps its judgement about the ELB for Bank Rate under active review, as it can vary over time as  circumstances change. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the MPC judged that the ELB for Bank Rate was   Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 1 The economic outlook   13        0.5%. In 2016, it judged that the ELB had fallen to ‘close to, but a little above zero’. Those judgements were based  on evidence about how any further rate cuts might be passed through to the economy at that time, and the risks  they might pose to the financial sector.      Cuts that result in negative policy rates would affect the economy through some of the same channels as  cuts that keep rates positive…  In practice, a negative policy rate means that some or all of the cash reserves held by private sector banks at the  central bank are charged interest rather than earning interest. The rate of interest on those reserves influences a  wide range of interest rates in the economy and borrowing costs in financial markets. Asset prices would be  expected to rise in response to a reduction in rates, as companies’ future earnings are discounted at a lower  interest rate. Higher asset prices would boost the economy by increasing the value of companies’ and households’  collateral, thereby enabling them to raise external funds more cheaply and encouraging borrowing. Lower financial  market interest rates would also be expected to lead to a depreciation of the exchange rate, boosting demand for  UK exports, and raising inflation via higher import prices.     …but some aspects of the transmission mechanism are likely to be different, which could have an impact  on how effective a negative interest rate policy would be in boosting the economy.   A cut to Bank Rate below zero might not affect interest rates in the wider economy in the same way as when it is  cut to a level above zero, however. In particular, the transmission to household deposit rates might be attenuated.  A report from the Committee on the Global Financial System at the Bank for International Settlements on  unconventional monetary policy concluded that, in countries that have set negative policy rates, many aspects of  the monetary policy transmission mechanism functioned roughly as normal after a cut in policy rates to below zero.  But deposit rates for households typically did not fall below zero. That, in turn, can affect banks’ behaviour,  increasing uncertainties about the macroeconomic effects of negative policy rates. The borrowing rates faced by  most households and businesses tended to fall in other countries, but remained positive.  The effectiveness of the  transmission of a negative policy rate might also be affected if it is perceived to be unusual and affects households’  and businesses’ confidence.    What are the uncertainties around the effectiveness of negative policy rates on the macro economy?  All policy tools come with uncertainties as to their impact on the economy and the MPC regularly reviews  the effectiveness of all its policy tools.  The MPC assesses the appropriate monetary policy stance at each meeting, and also keeps under review the  appropriate tools for achieving its objectives. The appropriateness of each policy tool can change over time. It can  depend on the shock hitting the economy — for example, tools which act to loosen credit constraints might be  desirable in response to a financial shock. It can also depend on the state of the economy — for example, according  to the balance sheet strength of households, businesses and financial institutions. The following section considers  the particular issues around the effectiveness of negative policy rates.    Uncertainties about the impact of negative policy rates arise particularly from the tendency for household  deposit rates to not fall below zero.   As policy rates fall, interest rates faced by households and businesses in the economy usually follow. International  experience suggests that, while some corporate deposit rates fall below zero, interest rates on households’ bank  deposits tend not to go below zero. In part, that might reflect the existence of cash as an alternative to holding  money in deposit accounts. If deposit rates go negative, depositors may decide to withdraw their savings and hold  them in cash rather than pay a fee to hold their money with a bank. While there are some costs and difficulties with  holding cash, such as storage costs and the practicalities of paying bills and receiving wages, the incentive to use it  as an alternative to a deposit account is likely to increase if interest rates fall below zero. Banks might also be  unwilling to lower deposit rates below zero for other reasons. For example, a negative interest rate could affect  depositors’ confidence.     Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 1 The economic outlook   14        If deposit rates do not fall below zero, the transmission of a cut in policy rates to loan rates could also be  attenuated, lowering their expansionary effect.   Banks pay interest on deposits and earn interest on loans. If lending rates and deposit rates fall in tandem, banks’  interest margins remain unchanged, other things equal. But if deposit rates cannot fall below zero, while some  existing loan rates are linked to policy rates — or other market interest rates — then the wedge between lending  and deposit rates will narrow as policy rates enter negative territory. As the wedge narrows, banks’ interest  margins decline, and as a result, their profitability can fall, although they can benefit from an increase in the value  of the financial assets they hold.1 All else equal, the impact on banks’ profitability would be larger the greater their  reliance on retail deposit funding compared with other sources of funding, for which interest rates would be  expected to fall alongside Bank Rate. In the UK, smaller banks and building societies are generally most exposed to  these risks.      To sustain their interest margins, banks might choose not to reduce new lending rates fully in line with declines in  policy rates. That could support bank profitability. But it would also reduce the expansionary effect of negative  policy rates. In countries that have implemented negative policy rates, studies typically find positive and often  strong pass through to lending rates despite household deposit rates not going below zero.2 However, pass- through is likely to depend on the structure of the financial system, as well as the prevailing economic and financial  conditions.     The volume of lending could also be restricted, although this would be expected to occur only when  lenders are concerned about future capital ratios.    Banks could also potentially respond to the prospect of declining interest income by reducing the pace of net  lending. If banks are particularly worried about maintaining their capital ratios — the ratio of capital to risk- weighted assets — they could choose to reduce risk-weighted assets by reducing lending. This strategy might be  more likely to be employed when banks are under balance sheet pressure, perhaps because credit losses are  accumulating.      Importantly, these risks vary over time, and downside risks to lending are likely to be higher when banks  are concerned about losses on existing loans increasing.  As a result, banks might be more likely to widen lending spreads or reduce their lending in response to lower  interest income during an economic downturn. When activity in the economy is falling, and unemployment is rising,  losses on banks’ existing loans are likely to pick up. Their balance sheets — and capital ratios — might therefore be  less healthy than they otherwise would be and there is likely to be greater uncertainty over their future capital  ratios. Altavilla et al (2019) find that negative policy rates have boosted investment spending in the euro area, but  that effect depends on the health of banks’ balance sheets.     UK banks are resilient, but they are likely to face further losses from the effects of the Covid-19 economic  shock…  The UK financial system is sound, and banks’ capital ratios have increased markedly over the past decade (see the  August 2020 Financial Stability Report). Nonetheless, risks to banks’ balance sheets are likely to be rising at the  moment. The impact of Covid-19 on the economy will result in losses for lenders, as some businesses fail and some  households lose their jobs. As a result, implementing negative policy rates might be less effective in providing  stimulus to the economy at the current juncture than at a time when banks’ balance sheets are improving.     …and some households and corporate balance sheets may be more vulnerable to shocks at the present  time.  Moreover, banks currently have an important role to play in the economic recovery, by providing finance to  households and companies. If banks curtailed lending to households and, in particular, corporates at the current  juncture, it would provide a headwind to spending.         Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 1 The economic outlook   15        Central bank actions can partially mitigate these effects…  Some central banks have introduced a tiering system for central bank reserves to help partially mitigate the effect  of negative policy rates on banks’ net interest income. Under a tiering system, different parts of the outstanding  balances of financial institutions’ accounts with the central bank have different interest rates applied to them, so  that not all reserves are subject to negative rates. Central bank funding schemes can also act as a partial mitigant,  as the interest rates on that funding can be linked to policy rates.     …and if the economic outlook improves in response to monetary policy stimulus, that can boost bank  profits by lowering impairments.  Negative policy rates may still boost the economy even if the transmission via household and corporate interest  rates is attenuated, and that could have a positive effect on banks’ balance sheets. Improved prospects for the real  economy should reduce the amount of impaired loans banks might experience, boosting their profitability. That is  consistent with some evidence from the euro area, which found that losses were lower than they otherwise would  have been following the introduction of negative policy rates by the ECB.3 The resulting improvement in  profitability was sufficient to offset the impact from reduced interest income.      Conclusion  The effectiveness of a negative policy rate in stimulating the economy will depend importantly on its  transmission through the banking sector.  The appropriate policy tools for achieving the MPC’s objectives can change over time depending on economic and  financial conditions. At present, banks’ balance sheets will be negatively affected by the period of severe economic  disruption arising from Covid-19. And they have an important role to play in helping the UK economy recover by  providing finance for individuals and companies. As a result, negative policy rates at this time could be less effective  as a tool to stimulate the economy. That said, the wider economy and banks’ balance sheets would be boosted by  stimulus. The net effect of negative policy rates depends on these, among other, factors.    The MPC will continue to review the appropriateness of a negative policy rate as a policy tool alongside  its broader toolkit.   The MPC has other instruments available — for example, asset purchases and forward guidance. The MPC will  continue to assess the appropriate monetary policy stance and will keep the appropriate tools for achieving its  remit — including negative policy rates — under review.                                       1   See for example, Brunnermeier and Koby (2018).  2   See for example, Erikson and Vestin (2019) for Sweden, Adolfsen and Spange (2020) for Denmark and Altavilla et al (2019) for the euro area.

Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 1 The economic outlook   16        Box 2  Monetary policy since the May Report  At its meeting ending on 17 June 2020, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%. The Committee  voted by a majority of 8–1 to increase the target stock of purchased UK government bonds, financed by the  issuance of central bank reserves, by an additional £100 billion, to take the total stock of asset purchases to  £745 billion.     Risky asset prices had recovered further from their March lows, although they had remained sensitive to news on  the evolution of the pandemic. Recent data outturns suggested that the fall in global GDP in 2020 Q2 would be less  severe than expected at the time of the May Monetary Policy Report. There were signs of consumer spending and  services output picking up, following the easing of Covid-related restrictions on economic activity. Additional  announcements of easier monetary and fiscal policy would help to support the recovery. Downside risks to the  global outlook remained, however, including from the spread of Covid-19 within emerging market economies and  from a return to a higher rate of infection in advanced economies.     UK GDP contracted by around 20% in April, following a 6% fall in March. Evidence from more timely indicators  suggested that GDP started to recover thereafter. Payments data were consistent with a recovery in consumer  spending in May and June, and housing activity had started to pick up. The LFS unemployment rate was unchanged  at 3.9% in the three months to April. But other and more timely indications from the claimant count, HMRC payrolls  data and job vacancies suggested that the labour market had weakened materially. Following stronger than  expected take-up of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, a greater number of workers were likely to be  furloughed in the second quarter. Evidence from business surveys and the Bank’s Agents was consistent with a  weak outlook for employment in coming quarters. Some households were also worried about their job security.     Twelve-month CPI inflation declined from 1.5% in March to 0.8% in April, triggering the explanatory letter from the  Governor to the Chancellor published alongside the monetary policy announcement. CPI inflation fell further in  May, to 0.5%. Below-target rates of CPI inflation could in large part be accounted for by the effects of the  pandemic. The collapse in global oil prices had direct effects on inflation, via the prices of motor fuels, and indirect  effects by reducing input costs in other sectors of the economy. The sharp drop in domestic activity was also adding  to downward pressure on inflation through increased spare capacity in most sectors of the economy.     The unprecedented situation meant that the outlook for the UK and global economies was unusually uncertain. It  would depend critically on the evolution of the pandemic, measures taken to protect public health, and how  governments, households and businesses responded to these factors.    The emerging evidence suggested that the fall in UK GDP in 2020 Q2 would be less severe than set out in the  May Report. Although stronger than expected, it was difficult to make a clear inference from that about the  recovery thereafter. There was a risk of higher and more persistent unemployment in UK. Even with the relaxation  of some Covid-related restrictions on economic activity, a degree of precautionary behaviour by households and  businesses was likely to persist. The economy, and especially the labour market, would therefore take some time to  recover towards its previous path. CPI inflation was well below the 2% target and was expected to fall further  below it in coming quarters, largely reflecting the weakness of demand.    At this meeting, the MPC judged that a further easing of monetary policy was warranted to meet its statutory  objectives.               Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 2 Current economic conditions   17        2 Current economic conditions    Global activity fell sharply in March and April following the widespread introduction of  social distancing measures. There has been a partial recovery since then as lockdowns  have been relaxed. Financial conditions have eased since the May Report, although they  remain tighter than at the start of the year.  Similarly, UK activity fell very sharply, as actions to control the spread of Covid-19  affected spending, but has recovered somewhat since April. Nonetheless, UK output is  expected to have fallen by 21% in Q2 as a whole and to remain well below its late-2019  level in the near term. The unemployment rate is expected to increase to 5.5% in Q3 and  7.5% by the end of the year.  Inflation was 0.6% in Q2, and has been depressed by the effects of Covid-19 on global  energy prices and UK activity. These effects are likely to continue to drag on inflation in  the near term. Government measures, including the VAT cut on some consumer services  from July, mean that inflation is expected to remain well below the MPC’s 2% target over  the rest of the year.

Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 2 Current economic conditions   18        2.1   The global economy    Global GDP fell sharply in 2020 Q2 as social distancing measures became more widespread…  Global activity fell for a second consecutive quarter in 2020 Q2 (Table 2.A). Having fallen by 2.6% in Q1, Bank staff  estimate that UK-weighted world GDP fell by around a further 9% in Q2. This is over four times larger than any  quarterly fall recorded during the financial crisis. The severity of the contraction reflects social distancing measures  being widespread across the UK’s major trading partners for a large part of the quarter. The restrictions on activity  are apparent in the sharp fall in mobility indices, which capture changes in the number of people travelling  (Chart 2.2).

Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 2 Current economic conditions   19        Chinese growth rebounded in Q2 after an earlier easing of lockdown restrictions.  China’s lockdown both began and eased earlier than other large economies. With parts of the country in lockdown  from late January, Chinese GDP contracted by 10% in the first quarter. As restrictions started to ease from late  February, industrial production recovered sharply (Chart 2.4). Service sector output and retail sales also picked up,  albeit to a lesser extent. Overall, GDP grew by 11.5% in 2020 Q2.

Data are not  seasonally adjusted.  (b) Date of lockdown easing defined as the first reduction in the Oxford Stringency Index. For the  US, an in-house stringency index is used.      Overall, the fall in world GDP in Q2 was around half that assumed in the May illustrative scenario.   Taken together, the estimated 9% fall in world GDP in 2020 Q2 was materially less sharp than was the case in the  May illustrative scenario. That is largely because social distancing measures were eased earlier than assumed in a  number of countries. It also appears that consumer spending began to recover across a number of countries even  before official lockdown measures were eased.     Absent a widespread resurgence in lockdown measures, output is expected to recover somewhat in Q3…  UK-weighted world GDP is expected to grow by 4.5% in 2020 Q3. All major regions are expected to record positive  quarterly growth as activity continues to recover. Nonetheless, world GDP is expected to still be around 7½% below  its level at the end of 2019.    The extent of the recovery in activity will depend importantly on how well countries control the spread of the  disease and whether the widespread reimposition of lockdowns is required. A rise in cases in some areas of China,  Europe and the US has led to the reintroduction of localised lockdown measures. And some indicators, such as  US credit card transactions and restaurant bookings, suggest that these measures are affecting spending.     Even without lockdown measures, fear of infection may continue to weigh on spending. Despite an easing in  lockdowns, demand for goods and services that involve social interaction has remained subdued in many countries.  For example, Google searches for social activities, an indicator of social spending, remain around 25% below their  level a year ago in the US (Chart 2.5). Social spending has recovered faster in regions where the virus has been  more contained, such as Germany. Uncertainty over the spread of the virus is also likely to weigh on business  investment.          Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 2 Current economic conditions   20        …and activity continues to be supported by the unprecedented policy response from governments and  central banks.   At the time of the May Report, monetary policy had been loosened markedly, lending facilities had been created to  support firms’ cash flow and governments had provided substantial direct help to support employment and income  (Chart 2.6).     Additional fiscal announcements have been made since the May Report. For example, EU leaders have agreed a  €750 billion recovery fund to help tackle the crisis and a sizable fiscal package is being debated in the US Congress.  These actions will support activity alongside the usual ‘automatic stabilisers’ — higher benefit payments and lower  tax receipts — that operate when the economy slows.    Monetary policy remains accommodative. At its June meeting, the ECB Governing Council increased the size of its  Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme by €600 billion to €1.35 trillion. The Federal Open Market Committee  indicated that it would, having gradually slowed its asset purchases during May, maintain at least the current pace  in the coming months. Market-implied paths for policy rates are a little lower than in the run-up to the May Report  (Chart 2.7).

(b) Upper bound of the target range.    Commodity prices have risen as global activity has increased.  Oil and other commodity prices have picked up since May. The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil fell below  US$20 in April (Chart 2.8), as transport restrictions led to a sharp fall in demand for fuel, and major oil producers  failed to reach an agreement on restricting production. As global demand has recovered and producers in the US,  Canada and OPEC+ countries have lowered production, the oil price has risen to above US$40 per barrel, although  it remains well below its level a year ago.    Inflation remains subdued in many countries.  The partial recovery in oil prices has led to a slight pickup in the latest headline inflation figures for some countries,  although fuel prices continue to act as a drag overall. Euro-area inflation picked up a little from a four-year low of  0.1% in May, to 0.3% in June (Table 2.B). Similarly, inflation has risen by 0.3 percentage points in the US. Headline  inflation remains weak, however. And core inflation — which strips out the impact of energy prices and other  volatile elements — has continued to fall in both the euro area and the US.

Financial markets were extremely volatile after the worldwide spread of Covid-19 became apparent in March. A  precautionary demand for liquidity and the need for a dramatic distribution of that around the financial system  resulted in an abrupt and disruptive ‘dash for cash’. This was associated with a period of severe market dysfunction,  and a combination of falling equity prices and rising borrowing costs meant that global financial conditions were at  their tightest since 2008. Markets stabilised in April following an exceptionally large policy response from  governments and central banks around the world. The August Financial Stability Report discusses these events in  more detail.     Risky asset prices have increased since the May Report…  Global equity prices have increased since the May Report (Chart 2.9), reflecting the easing of lockdown measures,  stronger-than-expected macroeconomic data, and economic support measures from governments and central  banks. The US S&P 500 and the Euro Stoxx indices are now around 40% higher than their March lows and around  15% higher than in the run-up to May Report. Measures of equity price volatility, such as the VIX, remain above  their historical averages, but have fallen since their March highs. Market intelligence suggests the level of volatility  will continue to be sensitive to investor concerns over news about the spread of the pandemic, as well as  geopolitical tensions.     Corporate bond spreads have narrowed. The spreads on high-yield bonds have fallen by between 140 and 240 basis  points since the May Report and investment-grade spreads have also fallen significantly, although both remain  higher than at the start of the year (Chart 2.10).

According to a summary measure covering 43 countries, financial conditions have eased since the May Report  (Chart 2.11). This reflects a combination of rising equity prices, lower volatility and falling borrowing costs.  Nevertheless, financial conditions remain somewhat tighter than they were before the pandemic.

The market-implied path for Bank Rate is lower than in the run-up to  the May Report (Chart 2.7). The yield curve dips below zero over coming years, suggesting that market participants  attach some weight to the possibility of negative policy rates.          Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 2 Current economic conditions   23        …but the recovery in UK equity prices has been weaker than in other advanced economies and sterling  has depreciated.   The rise in the FTSE All-Share index has been smaller than gains in equity price indices in some other advanced  economies, and it remains 20% below its level at the start of the year. That partly reflects the sectoral composition  of the FTSE index, which, relative to its foreign counterparts, is weighted more towards sectors which have been  hard hit by the pandemic, such as oil and gas, and less towards others, such as technology. But it could also reflect  weaker data outturns and lower expectations for near-term economic growth in the UK relative to other advanced  economies. Sterling has also depreciated by around 1¾% since the May Report. Market participants place more  weight on sterling depreciating than appreciating in the coming months: insuring against a large depreciation  remains much more expensive than insuring against a large appreciation (Chart 2.12). Market intelligence suggests  that Brexit-related uncertainty continues to weigh on sterling.      The supply of credit to UK companies appears largely to have met the very strong demand from firms.  UK companies have raised a significant amount of finance since the outbreak of Covid-19. Net finance raised was  around £70 billion in the four months to June, more than triple the amount raised in 2019 as a whole   (Chart 2.13). For large companies much of this has been met through capital markets. As noted in the August  Financial Stability Report, equity issuance and investment-grade corporate bond issuance by UK firms have been  much higher recently than in previous years.     A significant amount of finance has also been raised from the banking sector. Lenders reported a significant  increase in the availability of credit across all firm sizes in the Q2 Credit Conditions Survey (CCS), with the net  percentage balances the highest since the question was first asked in 2009. Only a very small proportion of firms in  the latest Decision Maker Panel (DMP) Survey expected credit to be unavailable if required (Chart 2.14).

(a) Question: ‘Relative to what would have otherwise happened, how do you expect the spread of  Coronavirus (Covid-19) to affect your demand for credit in 2020 Q2?’.    This has been supported by government-backed loan schemes…  The availability of credit has been supported by government-backed loan schemes. Since their launch, around £50  billion has been approved in total under the Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS), the Coronavirus Business  Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) and the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CLBILS)  (Chart 2.15). In addition, as of 29 July, large companies had outstanding drawings of around £17 billion under the  Covid Corporate Financing Facility.     …but some firms in disrupted sectors may be subject to credit constraints.   Additional financing will be needed this year to fill some firms’ continuing cash-flow deficits and to refinance  existing debts (see the August Financial Stability Report). Despite the strength in aggregate lending so far, some  firms may find it hard to raise the necessary funds. For example, the Bank’s Agents have received reports that some   Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 2 Current economic conditions   24        firms in vulnerable sectors, such as retail and travel, are struggling to access finance (Box 4). Some firms in these  sectors may also be struggling to access trade credit. There has only been a modest tightening in the availability of  trade credit so far and the Government’s trade credit insurance guarantee scheme has supported existing lines of  business. The Bank’s Agents have reported that insurers remain reluctant to write new policies for the most  exposed sectors, however.      The introduction of government schemes has lowered borrowing costs for firms...  Under the CBILS and BBLS, firms pay no interest on loans for the first year. That has helped to lower interest rates  on new lending to non-financial businesses in aggregate. In June the average effective rate was around 90 basis  points lower than in April, and around 120 basis points lower than in February (Table 2.C). Within this, the average  effective rate on new lending to SMEs fell sharply.

Households that already had a variable rate mortgage have benefitted from the cuts to Bank Rate the MPC made in  March. The average effective rate on these mortgages has fallen by around 70 basis points since February. Some  customers have taken mortgage payment holidays; one in six mortgages in the UK is currently subject to a payment  holiday according to UK Finance.    Quoted rates on new fixed-rate mortgages have not fallen, however. While rates on low-LTV mortgages have been  little changed in recent months, rates on high-LTV mortgages have picked up (Table 2.C). The CCS suggests that  lenders reduced the availability of secured credit across both high and low LTV mortgage products in Q2.  Respondents indicated that this reflected concerns over the economic outlook and a reduced appetite for risk.  Those factors, as well as ongoing operational constraints, could have put upward pressure on mortgage spreads,  which have widened as risk-free rates have fallen. Demand for mortgages has also fallen sharply during lockdown  as the housing market stalled. Mortgage approvals picked up somewhat in June, but remained around half their  February levels.     Unsecured borrowing rates, such as those on credit cards and personal loans, are also little changed since the May  Report. The level of consumer credit was broadly flat in June, having fallen from March to May (Chart 2.16) as  consumer spending fell (Section 2.3). The CCS suggests that lenders restricted the availability of unsecured credit  in Q2.     Overall, UK financial conditions have eased slightly since the May Report.   Overall, UK financial conditions have eased slightly since the May Report, although they remain tighter than in  January (Chart 2.17). In terms of their overall effects on economic growth, the widening in household credit   Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 2 Current economic conditions   25        spreads since May has been offset by the fall in risk-free rates, gains in equities, the depreciation of sterling and  lower spreads on corporate borrowing.

On 23 March, the UK Government implemented restrictions which required people to stay at home except for very  limited reasons, with enforced closure of non-essential shops and many consumer-facing service businesses.  International and domestic travel were reduced to a fraction of normal levels, while restaurants and non-food retail  businesses saw extremely low footfall (Chart 2.18).

Since mid-May, there has been a phased easing of lockdown restrictions. In England, this has included the  reopening of non-essential shops in June, with pubs and restaurants allowed to open from early July. The exact  timings have differed across the UK. While there have been some examples where targeted local restrictions have  had to be reinstated, the share of total consumption that has been restricted by Covid-19 measures has fallen  significantly since May (Chart 2.19).     Output is expected to have fallen by 21% in 2020 Q2...  Since the Covid-19 outbreak began to have a direct effect on UK households and businesses, demand has fallen  sharply. GDP fell by around 7% in March alone — such that output fell by just over 2% in Q1 as a whole — and in  April it fell by a further 20%. Output rose modestly in May, and is expected to have recovered to a greater extent in  June. Nonetheless, GDP is expected to have fallen by 21% in Q2 as a whole, and by 23% relative to 2019 Q4.     …which is a smaller fall than in the May illustrative scenario...   The fall in output in Q2 is expected to have been less severe than was assumed in the illustrative scenario in the  May Report. In that scenario, it was assumed that restrictions would be gradually unwound between early June and  late September, but they were lifted earlier. Some activity was also a little stronger than expected under lockdown.  By the start of June, motor vehicle traffic was around 30% below its usual level, having been about 65% below  normal at the start of April (Chart 2.18).    …but larger than in some other countries.  The fall in UK activity in Q2 is expected to have been larger than in some other countries (Table 2.A). That mainly  reflects differences in the timing of lockdown measures, which were in place for a larger part of Q2 in the UK than  in other economies. The mobility indices recovered more slowly in the UK than the US and euro area (Chart 2.2),  although the lifting of restrictions may provide more scope for recovery in the UK in Q3. Beyond the effect of  mandatory social distancing requirements, activity in specific countries will also be affected by the prevalence of  Covid-19. A YouGov poll suggests that in countries with a higher number of cases, around 50% of households  avoided going out to some extent, compared with less than 30% in countries with fewer cases.    It is also possible that certain features of the UK economy meant that Covid-19 had a larger impact on activity.   In the UK, spending on things that typically involve interactions with other people — such as attending cinemas,  restaurants, or live sports events — represents around 13% of total output, compared with around 11% in the US  and 10% in the euro area, and this type of spending has been particularly affected by Covid-19.

Companies that have not started  to receive payments through CHAPS following the easing of lockdown measures are assumed  to remain closed or to be making a very limited number of sales (though they may have started  to receive payments from merchant acquirers through other payment systems). Firms’ data  are mapped to the closest available ONS consumption categories and then weighted together  using the equivalent shares in the ONS consumption basket. For definitions of the different  consumption groups see the May 2020 MPR. Data are nominal, not seasonally adjusted, and  shown to 29 July.    Some types of consumer spending have picked up in Q2...  Payments data suggest that early in the lockdown, consumer spending was around 30%–40% below its level at the  start of the year, but that it has recovered somewhat following the relaxation of restrictions. The recovery in  spending has varied across different goods and services, however. Delayable spending — including on items such as  household furnishings, clothing and other larger items — fell materially after restrictions were introduced, but has  since picked up. The initial sharp recovery might have reflected some pent-up demand, with spending falling back a  little recently (Chart 2.20). Spending on staples — which includes types of expenditure that cannot generally be  delayed, such as on food and household energy — has remained robust throughout the pandemic. That is likely to  reflect, in part, substitution by consumers — for example, more food purchases instead of restaurant dining.   Work-related spending — which largely reflects spending on fuel and public transport — and social consumption   — spending that involves interactions with other people — are still some way below their levels at the start of   the year.1    While total consumer spending remains somewhat subdued, retail spending has largely recovered, partly due to an  increase in non-store sales, the majority of which represents online retailers (Chart 2.21). The sharp increase in  online sales is consistent with reports from the Bank’s Agents that companies have improved their capacity to  process sales online.     …and spending is expected to rise further in Q3.  Consumption is expected to have fallen by 20% in Q2 as a whole, but the recovery in spending that began during  the quarter is expected to continue, such that growth is strongly positive in Q3. The number of seated diners in  pubs and restaurants was close to zero until the end of June, but has picked up since those businesses were  allowed to reopen in early July, for example (right panel, Chart 2.18).     Overall, output is expected to remain well below its late-2019 level in Q3, although it is projected to be  higher than in the May illustrative scenario.  This pattern of consumer spending is the main driver of the MPC’s projected near-term path for output   (Chart 2.22). That expected path is not as weak as in the May illustrative scenario, with Q3 output expected to be  9% below its 2019 Q4 level, compared with 18% lower in the scenario.    1  For definitions of the different consumption groups see Chart 3.2 of the May Report.

Other includes  household investment, public sector spending, changes in inventories and acquisitions less  disposals of valuables.  (b)  Bank staff projections.    The fall in consumption in Q2 is expected to have caused a sharp pickup in the saving rate.  While spending dropped sharply during lockdown, incomes fell by less, partly due to government schemes such as  the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) and Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS), which  supported employment and earnings. As a result, household savings rose sharply in aggregate. Consistent with that,  deposits in household bank accounts increased by an average of £17 billion a month in the four months to June,  compared with an average of £5 billion a month in the previous six months. Overall, the saving rate is estimated to  have risen sharply in Q2, reaching 25%.    The saving rate is expected to fall back in the near term, but remain higher than it was at the end   of 2019.  The easing of Covid-19 restrictions should result in a further recovery in spending, and saving is likely to fall  alongside that. Households may decide to spend more of their income in the coming months, although the saving  rate is expected to remain elevated in Q3 compared with its level at the end of 2019.     Continuing uncertainty could hold back the recovery in spending.  While spending is expected to recover somewhat, continued uncertainty around the continuing risk to health from  Covid-19 could hamper that recovery. An ONS survey on the social impacts of Covid-19 suggests that more than  60% of all adults would feel uncomfortable about going to the cinema at present and close to 50% would feel  uncomfortable about eating indoors at a restaurant (Chart 2.23). Estimates based on US data suggest that fear of  Covid-19 has had a significant effect on spending there (Goolsbee and Syverson (2020)).    For households that are uncertain about the economic outlook, and in particular those that are concerned about  possible redundancies, there could be an incentive to save a higher share of their income for precautionary  reasons. The GfK/EC consumer confidence indicator picked up in July, but remains well below its historical average,  suggesting that households remain cautious overall (Chart 2.24). Each household faces different circumstances and  these differences will influence their spending decisions (Box 3).

Housing market activity fell significantly in April, when the market was effectively closed…  Housing transactions fell significantly as a result of Covid-19, as restrictions on housing market activity prevented a  large number of house purchases that would otherwise have taken place. In April, just over 40,000 transactions  were completed, compared with close to 100,000 per month at the start of 2020. There were not enough  transactions in April and May for the ONS to produce reliable house price statistics, so the publication of the data  was temporarily suspended.    …but the reopening of the market has led to a recovery in activity in recent months.  Since restrictions were eased, activity in the housing market has picked up. RICS new buyer enquiries increased  substantially in May and June, recovering from record lows in April. The temporary increase in the threshold at  which homebuyers start paying Stamp Duty is also expected to boost the number of transactions. House prices fell  in Q2 according to the Nationwide and Halifax data, but other indicators suggest some signs of a pickup since then:  Rightmove data suggest that asking prices in Great Britain increased by 2.4% between March and July.    Businesses expect their revenues to be lower as a result of Covid-19…  Most businesses expect Covid-19 to have a large and persistent negative impact on their sales. Many were not able  to operate at their normal level of capacity, or at all, while social distancing measures were in place. For those that  were able to open, in many cases demand was much weaker than usual. Respondents to the DMP Survey expected  sales to be 30% lower in Q2 as a result of Covid-19 and to still be 8% lower at the start of 2021.    …and are facing significant uncertainty.  Businesses have been reporting higher uncertainty since March, although there is some evidence that it has fallen  back a little since its April peak. Three quarters of DMP Survey respondents reported that overall uncertainty was  high or very high in July, compared with around 40% before Covid-19 restrictions were introduced. Firms’  uncertainty around their year-ahead sales expectations has followed a similar pattern.    Lower sales and higher uncertainty are both expected to have contributed to a fall in investment.  In 2020 Q2, business investment is expected to have been 35% lower than at the end of 2019, as weaker sales  reduce corporate cash flows and higher uncertainty increases the incentive to postpone investment projects   (see Section 4 of the November 2019 Report for more detail on the impact of uncertainty on investment). That is  consistent with the results from the DMP Survey, where businesses reported that they would spend 33% less on  investment than they otherwise would have in Q2 (Chart 2.25). Intelligence from the Bank’s Agents also suggests  that firms have cut investment significantly, with some reports of investment spending being redirected towards   Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 2 Current economic conditions   30        reopening and implementing Covid-related working practices, such as social distancing measures and remote  working.     Business investment is expected to remain weak in the near term, with some indicators of investment intentions at  historical lows (Chart 2.26). The near-term path of business investment will reflect the lags involved in investment  spending, such that the full impact of Covid-19 could take some time to materialise. The UK will move to new  trading arrangements with the EU on 1 January 2021, so additional uncertainty around the nature of those changes  could also weigh on business investment.    As in other countries, UK exports and imports have been weak.  Both exports and imports have been hit by Covid-19 restrictions. The weakness of global growth, along with  disruption to global supply chains, is expected to have led to a fall in UK exports of around 20% in Q2 compared  with 2019 Q4. Similarly, the weakness of UK domestic activity has also reduced the demand for imports, such that  they are expected to have fallen by a similar amount. Travel restrictions in place in the UK and around the world  have also significantly reduced the flow of tourists to and from the UK. The move to new trading arrangements  between the UK and EU is expected to weigh on both import and export growth in 2021.    Fiscal policy is expected to support demand.  The Government has increased spending materially to support the economy, via the Budget 2020 fiscal package  and further policies announced in response to Covid-19 (see Box 3 of May Report). Since May, the Government has  announced additional measures, including temporarily lowering VAT from 20% to 5% on restaurant dining,  accommodation and attractions as well as incentives for firms to retain furloughed workers and hire new  apprentices. The projections set out in this Report are conditioned on the OBR’s assessment of the Government’s  current tax and spending plans (Section 1).

Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 2 Current economic conditions   31        2.4   Employment, costs and prices    Covid-19 has caused a significant shock to the labour market…  Under the restrictions introduced in response to Covid-19, many households and business were unable to function  normally. Those that could not work from home were unable to work at all in many cases. Many businesses were  ordered to close, and many others chose to cease trading due to concerns over employee safety and lack of  demand. Their demand for labour fell sharply as a result.    …although government schemes have enabled many businesses to retain their workers.  While businesses' demand for labour fell, given the nature of the shock, many employees were temporarily  furloughed under the CJRS. Under that scheme, the Government paid 80% of the income of employees that were  furloughed, up to £2,500 per month. The SEISS also provided grants to the self‑employed. Take-up of both schemes  has been high. Close to 80% of businesses that responded to the June DMP Survey reported having made use of the  CJRS and 9½ million jobs have been furloughed under the scheme at some point (Chart 2.27), although the number  of furloughed jobs at any one time will be lower.2 Similarly, around 80% of eligible self-employed workers made use  of the SEISS, which corresponds to 2.7 million total claims.

Chart 2.28 Income tax data suggest that there has been  a large fall in the number of paid employees  Three-month change in the number of employees      Sources: HMRC, ONS and Bank calculations.    The official data suggest that employment fell in the three months to May...  Despite having been supported by the CJRS and SEISS, employment has fallen since the Covid-19 outbreak,  although different indicators give different steers as to the size of the change. According to the latest Labour Force  Survey (LFS) data, employment fell by 130,000 in the three months to May, but the fall was more than accounted  for by lower self-employment. According to HMRC Pay As You Earn (PAYE) data, the number of employees  decreased by over half a million in the three months to June, equivalent to a 2% drop (Chart 2.28).     …while unemployment was little changed…  According to the LFS, unemployment was little changed in the three months to May. That will partly reflect the  impact of staff being retained on furlough and changes in participation. The ONS has also noted the practical  challenges associated with collecting statistics at this time. The LFS estimates are based on reduced response rates  due to Covid-19, and for non-respondents it is assumed that there is no change in labour market status.3     Alternative sources of data suggest that unemployment has begun to rise. There has been a much larger rise in the  number of people claiming benefits: the claimant count rose by 1.2 million in Q2 (Chart 2.29) and the claimant    2  This refers to furloughed jobs, as opposed to the number of furloughed workers. Bank staff estimate that the peak number of employees on furlough was over   7 million in May and that around 6 million employees were furloughed on average during Q2.  3  See the ONS article ‘Coronavirus and the effects on UK labour market statistics’ for more details.   Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 2 Current economic conditions   32        count rate — at around 7% — has risen above the LFS unemployment rate for the first time. It is possible that the  claimant count overstates the extent of unemployment, however. Some claimants will be entitled to claim benefits  while having a job and some people that lost their jobs in March may have claimed benefits at that time, but then  subsequently been placed on furlough. Over half a million excess claims were made before it was announced that  employees previously made redundant could be placed on furlough under the CJRS.     Bank staff estimate that unemployment has risen, although it appears to have increased by substantially less than  in the illustrative scenario in the May Report. Unemployment is expected to increase further in the near term  (Section 3). Intelligence from the Insolvency Service suggests redundancy intention notifications rose notably in  June and the number of internet searches for terms related to redundancies has remained elevated (Chart 2.30).    …as inactivity has picked up markedly. Underemployment also rose sharply.  Many people who have lost their jobs have been recorded as inactive, as opposed to unemployed, given that they  have not been actively searching for a job. Consistent with that, there has been a significant rise the number of  working-age people that are inactive but would like a job in the three months to May. Lockdown measures,  including school closures, might have meant that some people have not been looking for work, or have not been  available to start a new job.    In addition to those leaving employment, lower labour demand has also resulted in a fall in the number of hours  people have worked. Weekly LFS data suggest average hours fell by around 20% in the week that lockdown  measures were introduced and there was a sharp increase in the number of people who reported working fewer  hours than normal due to economic conditions. Furloughed employees were not working at all at that time, which  largely explains the fall in hours worked among employees, while the average hours worked by the self-employed  also fell sharply. If workers would like to increase their hours, this would add to the degree of labour market slack.  For a more detailed discussion of spare capacity in the labour market, see Section 4.

Many workers have seen a reduction in their earnings  Average pay growth has fallen sharply. In the three months to May, whole-economy total annual pay growth   was -0.3%, down from 2.9% in the three months to February. In the private sector, bonuses fell by almost 15%   in the three months to May compared with a year earlier, the largest fall since 2009. Agency intelligence suggests  that in many cases, bonuses have been scaled back or withdrawn altogether for this year. Excluding bonuses,  private sector pay growth was zero.      Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 2 Current economic conditions   33        A large number of employees have seen their incomes reduced, including those entering the CJRS. Under the CJRS,  the Government committed to paying 80% of the wages of furloughed workers initially, although some employers  reported paying their furloughed workers over and above this. That would have had a negative direct effect on the  AWE data, which Bank staff estimated to be of the order of 2½% on private sector AWE at the peak in Q2.    Some downward pressure on wage growth is also likely to have resulted from the sharp fall in demand across a  number of sectors. Survey data are consistent with this, with REC pay indicators falling to levels last seen in 2009.  And Agency intelligence suggests that the incidence of pay freezes or cuts has increased. However, the rise in the  National Living Wage in April will have increased the pay of some workers.     Output per worker is likely to have fallen in Q2…  Given that people on furlough are still counted as employed, the furloughing of workers will have mechanically  reduced aggregate output per worker, although output per hour is expected to have increased. Until July,  furloughed employees were not permitted to undertake any work, reducing their output to zero. Largely as a result,  annual growth in output per worker is estimated to have been -22% in Q2. The large fall in average hours worked  means that growth in output per hour is expected to have picked up to 2.4%, however.    …which is expected to lead to a spike in measured unit labour cost growth.  The marked fall in the growth of output per worker is much larger than the decline in wage growth. As a result,  annual growth in unit labour costs (ULCs), which measure the labour cost of producing one unit of output, is  expected to have picked up very sharply in Q2. As the sharp rise in annual ULC growth in large part reflects the  impact of furloughing, though, it is likely to be temporary. Whole-economy ULCs also do not currently reflect  businesses’ labour costs, as the Government is paying the majority of furloughed workers’ wages. The actual cost to  businesses of producing a unit of output — excluding CJRS payments for furloughed workers — has also increased,  because the productivity of those in work has fallen by more than their pay, which tends to be slow to adjust. The  rise in costs is expected to have been significantly smaller on this basis, however. As pay adjusts and output  recovers, the underlying trend for ULCs will become clearer.    The changing composition of the workforce — with lower-paid workers more likely to have lost their jobs as a  result of Covid-19 — may push up average pay and productivity to some extent, partly offsetting the effect of  weaker demand. Given that both pay and productivity are likely to be affected in a similar way, however, this  should have relatively little effect on ULCs.    CPI inflation has fallen well below the target…  CPI inflation fell from 1.7% in Q1 to 0.6% in Q2. That fall partly reflected declines in energy and utility prices that  were in train before the Covid-19 outbreak had widespread effects, as well as the impact of Covid-19 on economic  activity in the UK and globally. Reflecting weaker global growth, US dollar oil prices fell significantly between  January and April and, although they have recovered somewhat since, they remain around 35% lower than at the  start of the year (Chart 2.8). That has had a direct effect on inflation via the prices of motor fuels (Chart 2.31), as  well as an indirect effect by reducing input costs in other sectors of the economy.     …and is expected to decline further in Q3.  Inflation is expected to turn briefly negative in the near term, falling to -0.3% in August. Lower energy prices are  expected to continue to weigh on inflation and the announced cut to VAT on restaurant dining, accommodation  and attractions will act as an additional drag, reducing inflation by an estimated 0.3 percentage points in Q3 and   0.4 percentage points in Q4 respectively. The Government’s Eat Out to Help Out scheme is expected to pull down  inflation by a further 0.4 percentage points in August. Following the expiry of that scheme in September, inflation is  expected to pick up to around ¼%. While the effect of those measures will be temporary, the effect of weaker  demand on domestic price pressures is expected to be more persistent (Section 4).    Some indicators of companies’ inflation expectations remain low, but the expectations of external  forecasters have been little changed, and movements in household measures have been mixed.  Some indicators of companies’ inflation expectations remain low. Companies’ reported expectations in the  distribution sector tend to be quite volatile, but these are at 0.4% at the one-year horizon and 1.0% at the   two-year horizon (Table 2.D). Firms’ plans for prices have also softened according to the DMP Survey (Chart 4.10).   Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 2 Current economic conditions   34        However, expectations of external forecasters and financial markets participants have remained broadly  unchanged. In terms of households’ inflation expectations, the fall in actual inflation might have been expected to  lead to lower short-term inflation expectations, but expectations have been broadly stable at the one-year horizon.  The Bank/TNS survey suggests households’ medium-term inflation expectations have fallen, but a change to the  survey method may have affected those estimates in Q2.4 The YouGov/Citigroup measure of households’   medium-term expectations has been broadly stable. Overall, the MPC judges that inflation expectations remain  well anchored.

Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 2 Current economic conditions   35        Box 3   Insights from Bank surveys on the impact of Covid-19 on households’ finances  This box uses evidence from the Bank-commissioned surveys by Ipsos MORI and NMG Consulting to assess the  impact of Covid-19 on households’ financial positions at different points in the income distribution.      Covid-19 has reduced incomes for a significant proportion of households.  Survey evidence suggests that around 30%–40% of households have experienced falls in income due to Covid-19.  Increases in income have been much less common, reported by around 10% of households. Much of the fall in  aggregate income resulted from people being made unemployed or furloughed. For those still working, the  self-employed have reported the largest hits to income, on average.    A similar proportion of people have reported income falls across different income brackets…  The proportion of households reporting that their income has fallen has been relatively similar across the income  distribution (Chart A). Brewer and Gardiner (2020) found a similar pattern analysing YouGov survey data. This is  despite those with lower incomes being more likely to be furloughed or made unemployed due to Covid-19  (Section 3). Using Money Dashboard data, Bourquin et al (2020) found that, although the earnings of the lowest  income households had fallen more than others between January and May, incomes had not.    There are several factors which might explain this.1 First, those on lower incomes are likely to receive a larger  proportion of any lost earnings back via government support. This has been re-enforced by the recent increases in  support provided through Universal Credit and the CJRS (HM Treasury (2020)). Second, a significant proportion of  people with low incomes were not employed before the pandemic and may have seen their incomes rise as  Universal Credit rates increased. Finally, individuals earning low wages are not necessarily in low income  households, once incomes of other household members have been taken into account. For example, research by  the Institute for Fiscal Studies has shown that the majority of minimum wage earners live in middle-income  households (Cribb et al (2019)).    Chart A A similar proportion of people have reported  income falls across income brackets  Reported changes in household income due to Covid-19(a)      Sources: Bank of England, Ipsos MORI and Bank calculations.    (a) Question: ‘Thinking about your total household income from all sources over the last week,  including any pay or benefits you might receive, on balance, would you say that your  household income has increased, decreased, or stayed the same compared with before the  coronavirus outbreak?’. July data were collected 3 to 6 July and the question asked about  income over the last month. Data are not seasonally adjusted.    Chart B A smaller proportion of lower income  households have reduced spending  Reported changes in spending due to Covid-19, by household  income(a)      Sources: Bank of England, Ipsos MORI, NMG Consulting and Bank calculations.    (a) Ipsos MORI question: ‘Thinking about your total household spending (eg on food and  household goods, products and services, on commuting, bills, etc) on balance would you say  that your household spending has increased, decreased, or stayed the same, compared with  before the coronavirus outbreak?’. Ipsos MORI data are shown on the last date of each survey  period. NMG question: Over the past month, how if at all, has your overall spending changed,  relative to what you would usually have spent, as a result of the outbreak of coronavirus?’.  NMG data were collected 2 to 28 April 2020. Data are not seasonally adjusted.      1   These channels are set out in more detail in Brewer and Gardiner (2020).   Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 2 Current economic conditions   36        While income falls have been less common for those with lowest incomes, their effects may be felt more acutely.  They are likely to place finances under more pressure than an equivalent fall for a higher income household.    …but spending has fallen for fewer lower income households…  In contrast to changes in income, changes in spending have been different across income brackets. A smaller  proportion of lower income households cut spending in response to the pandemic (Chart B). Differences in  spending patterns between households before the pandemic might help to explain some of the variation in  responses. Data from the Living Costs and Food Survey show that ‘social consumption’ accounts for more than a  quarter of higher income households’ total spending, a larger share than for other households. Much of that  spending has not been possible during lockdown as it typically involves social interaction, such as eating out or live  entertainment. Spending on staples is a more important component of consumption for lower income households.  It accounts for just under half of spending for households in the lowest income quintile, compared to less than a  third for households in the highest quintile.      …such that lower income households are more likely to have been left with lower savings.  The aggregate saving rate increased in Q1 and is likely to have risen sharply in Q2 (Section 2.3), but survey data  indicate that rises in saving have been heavily skewed towards high income households. Lower income households  have been more likely to report that their savings have fallen as a result of Covid-19 (Chart C). This is supported by  estimates that show, on average, those in the lower 60% of the income distribution have a deficit between changes  in income and changes in spending (Brewer and Gardiner (2020)). The differences are driven by spending  responses. Those with higher incomes, with larger cuts in consumption, are more likely to have built up savings.      Chart C More lower income households report having  run down savings, while others have built them up   Reported changes in savings due to Covid-19(a)      Sources: Bank of England, Ipsos MORI and Bank calculations.    (a) Question: ‘As a result of the measures taken around the coronavirus pandemic, would you  say that your household savings have increased, decreased, or stayed the same?’. Data were  collected 3 to 6 July 2020 and are not seasonally adjusted.    Chart D Fewer people on lower incomes expect to  increase spending on major purchases   Expected changes in spending on major purchases over the next   12 months(a)      Sources: NMG Consulting and Bank calculations.     (a) Question: ‘Compared to the last 12 months, do you expect to spend more or less money on  major purchases (such as a car, furniture and electrical goods) over the next year?’. Data  were collected 2 to 28 April 2020 and are not seasonally adjusted.    These differences across households may influence the recovery in spending.  How spending evolves will depend on how different households respond as social distancing measures are eased.  Savings have been concentrated in higher income households (Chart C). Lower and middle-income households  appear to have built up less savings or run them down. These households also tend to report more pessimistic  expectations about employment, potentially increasing the desire to build savings, and report slightly weaker  expectations for spending on major purchases (Chart D). That could pose a downside risk to spending over the next  year or so. But those households that have built up savings may seek to substitute foregone spending on social  consumption with other types of spending over time. This could mean that consumer spending is stronger than  expected. The risks around the outlook for consumption are discussed further in Section 1.   Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 2 Current economic conditions   37        Box 4   Agents’ update on business conditions  The key information from Agents’ contacts considered by the Monetary Policy Committee at its August meeting is  highlighted in this box.1    Firms experienced a varied recovery in output following a significant easing of lockdown measures  throughout June and July.  Agency intelligence gathered since late June indicates that economic activity is recovering across an increasing  range of sectors as social distancing measures have been eased further. However, persistent caution has dampened  the outlook, particularly for sectors reliant on consumer footfall. For instance, those restaurants and pubs that have  reopened have often reported severely depressed sales compared to normal, even when reduced capacities due to  social distancing measures are taken into account. Sectors involving social interaction have generally been severely  impacted by the pandemic, and demand growth has not increased in line with expectations. In contrast, retailers of  non-food goods reported that aggregate customer spending — combining online and stores sales — is now close to  normal levels compared with a year ago. Continued strong growth in online sales compensated for depressed   in-store activity. Taken together, sales of consumer goods and services in aggregate have only partially recovered as  more sectors have reopened.     In manufacturing, the vast majority of sites are now in operation. However, activity has generally remained weak,  and the majority of contacts reported operating at around 20% below capacity due to social distancing  requirements. Firms supplying automotive and civil aerospace sectors continued to report subdued demand. In  contrast, contacts in sectors supplying chemicals, healthcare and personal protective equipment continued to  report strong demand.    Contacts that import and export reported increasing concerns about these activities once the transition period  between the UK and EU has come to an end on 1 January 2021. They cite concerns about short-term delays as new  rules come into force, and increased overhead costs over the long term due to new administrative procedures.      In business services, contacts reported demand recovering only gradually in June and July following a significant fall  in activity in April. Demand is still substantially down on a year ago, and the scale of the recovery is mixed across  sectors. In professional services, demand is strong across corporate restructuring, insolvency, audit, debt  management, employment law and IT. This contrasts with weaker demand in areas such as mergers and  acquisitions. Following a severe contraction in April, marketing, advertising, recruitment and office equipment  wholesalers have since reported a gradual recovery in demand. Demand for business travel, hotels, conferencing  and corporate entertainment has remained particularly weak.    In construction, contacts reported that activity reached 80% of pre-Covid levels during July. The introduction of the  ‘one metre plus’ rule on sites allowed many to marginally increase their rate of activity. However, social distancing  measures continued to be the primary hurdle for further increases in the near future. Contractors that are focused  on public sector projects reported they expect output to increase gradually over the coming months. Some  anticipate they could increase activity enough to compensate for some of the time that sites were shut during  lockdown, falling only 10% short of their output targets for 2020. The pipeline of new orders for large construction  projects is low, though continued high demand for distribution buildings bucks this trend.    Across the housing market, pent-up demand had resulted in high levels of activity in secondary and new home  markets in June and July. Reflecting increased levels of remote working, and its likely persistence in the future,  properties with gardens and space to support home working were reported to be particularly popular. Seasonal    1   A comprehensive quarterly report on business conditions from the Agents is published alongside the MPC decision in non-Monetary Policy Report months. The  next report will be published on 17 September 2020   Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 2 Current economic conditions   38      rental demand from university students was subdued as online teaching increased and the number of overseas  students fell.    The outlook for the housing market during the remainder of 2020 is mixed. The temporary cut to stamp duty is  expected to support increased activity. However, an anticipated increase in unemployment, alongside a general  tightening of availability for mortgage products, is expected to slow activity by the end of the year.     Activity in commercial real estate sectors remained subdued. Demand for retail space continued to fall, with  expected increases in vacancy rates throughout the remainder of 2020. Contacts reported that deliberations are  underway about office space requirements in light of successful remote working, though few definitive decisions  have been made. Demand for warehouse space remained strong, reflecting an accelerated shift towards online  shopping.    Contacts reported that collection rates for commercial property rents were weak for the second quarter in a row,  particularly among retail tenants. Pressure is reported to be growing on landlords to restructure lease terms to link  future rents with the occupiers’ turnover.     The majority of firms are revising investment plans significantly downwards in 2020 and 2021.  Contacts regularly reported plans for lower investment in 2020 and 2021 (Chart A). Many have delayed or  cancelled plans outright. These decisions can primarily be explained by the majority of contacts, having experienced  a significant reduction in sales during the pandemic, remaining uncertain about how demand will recover over the  rest of the year.    Areas where investment plans have been maintained include large capital projects. This is particularly the case for  projects focused on construction activity, where long-term commitments cannot be easily revised. Some contacts  also reported redirecting some expenditure towards new IT equipment as remote working becomes embedded  across a wider range of firms.    Chart A Investment plans have been revised in response  to the pandemic.  Investment intentions over the next 12 months           Chart B Firms expect to make significant redundancies  over the next 12 months.  Employment intentions over the next 12 months      The outlook for employment and pay has worsened, with increases in the scale of redundancies and  widespread cancellation of pay awards for 2020.  Contacts reported a deterioration in the employment outlook (Chart B), with the rate of redundancies having  increased in June and July, ahead of the start of mandatory employer contributions to the Coronavirus Job  Retention Scheme (CJRS) in August. Further, even where activity has remained strong, a few contacts reported that  productivity-improving changes made during the pandemic are leading to redundancies or the reduction of hiring  plans. The heaviest job losses in recent weeks were reported by airline carriers, holiday operators, non-food  retailers, automotive manufacturers, and firms along aerospace supply chains.    Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 2 Current economic conditions   39        Contacts in a few sectors, including pharmaceutical, food processing, and logistics companies, reported the  continued hiring of new staff. Most also reported attempts to maintain apprenticeship and graduate hiring  schemes. The prospect for many of these are conditional on an improving economic outlook during the second half  of 2020.    Contacts from charity and voluntary organisations reported that retail income sources had been adversely affected  during lockdown. Income from corporate donations had also fallen, and contacts reported having to draw on their  cash reserves. Many were concerned that they would not be able to survive a prolonged economic downturn.  However, at the same time, demand for their services has increased during the pandemic, and is expected to  increase further if unemployment rises as the CJRS is phased out.    On pay, the majority of contacts who reported topping up wages for furloughed staff have stopped doing so. Pay  increases and bonuses are being deferred for 2020, except for legally mandated increases associated with the  National Living Wage.    Credit availability increased for firms, especially SMEs, although pockets of tightness remained in sectors  most affected by the pandemic.  Contacts reported a significant improvement in the availability of credit for small firms after the introduction of the  Bounce Back Loan Scheme. Following exceptionally high levels of borrowing for the few weeks after its introduction  in early May, demand for credit from small firms eased but remained strong. Contacts also reported widespread  use of the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme. However, in hard-hit sectors such as retail, hospitality  and leisure, there has been a tightening of credit availability as expectations of business failures increase.    There was a mixed picture for larger firms. Contacts reported that many felt credit would be available if required,  but also increasing availability of funding through capital markets reduced the need to draw upon credit facilities. In  contrast, large non-investment grade firms found the funding environment more difficult, especially those most  vulnerable to the impact of the pandemic. Take up of the new Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan  Scheme had been limited to date.    The need to create Covid-secure environments has increased cost pressures, while there is an uncertain  outlook for pricing strategies.  Contacts reported an increase in non-labour costs overall, although the picture is mixed. The need to create and  maintain ‘Covid-secure’ environments for staff and customers increased costs, as had sterling’s depreciation. Partly  offsetting that, cost pressures from energy and raw material inputs eased.     Contacts reported that pricing strategies will primarily be guided by the strength of the recovery in demand during  the second half of 2020. Some firms have been exploring whether consumers are more or less responsive to price  discounting than they were pre-Covid. At the same time, there are pressures to at least maintain prices at   pre-Covid levels to ensure margins over increased costs — in part resulting from lower productivity due to social  distancing measures — do not get squeezed too much.     Reports suggest the recent temporary VAT reduction to 5% from 20% is unlikely to be fully passed on to consumers  in the form of lower prices. For some firms, the cut is perceived as an opportunity to partially restore margins over  the higher costs experienced during the pandemic.                 Monetary Policy Report August 2020 Section 3 In Focus The outlook for the labour market 40        3 In focus The outlook for the  labour market  Bank staff estimate that around 6 million workers were furloughed on average during  2020 Q2, and numbers in employment have started to fall. Most of those furloughed are  expected to be re-employed as output picks up in the second half of 2020. Nevertheless,  the unemployment rate is expected to rise to around 7½% in 2020 Q4, as sales do not  recover fully for some businesses. The MPC judges that unemployment is likely to  decline only gradually from this peak. Firms may be reluctant to make hiring decisions  while uncertainty is high and the differential impact of Covid-19 on economic activity  across sectors is likely to increase the mismatch between vacancies and those looking for  work.   The pandemic has had a profound effect on the UK labour market. Social distancing rules have meant that  businesses have had to adapt working practices and some have been shut for a time since March. The reduction in  activity has also reduced firms’ demand for labour. The number of vacancies fell to a record low in Q2 (Chart 3.1)  and existing workers worked many fewer hours. At one point, around a third of private sector employees were  furloughed as part of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS): this led to the sharpest fall in hours worked on  record (Chart 3.2). Some workers have had their pay cut or been made redundant.  This In Focus considers the outlook for the labour market. Understanding how the labour market might evolve is  important for the MPC as it has implications for both price stability and economic growth. Households’  employment and income expectations affect spending and saving decisions. The labour market also has  implications for inflation via pay growth (Section 4). Section 3.1 looks at how the pandemic has affected different  industries and workers and how the labour market might evolve in the second half of 2020. Section 3.2 considers  how persistent the expected increase in unemployment might be. The MPC’s projection for unemployment is  covered in Section 3.3.     Chart 3.1 Vacancies declined to their lowest level on  record in Q2  Number of vacancies         Chart 3.2 Hours worked fell by a record amount in the  three months to May   Total weekly hours worked      Sources: ONS and Bank calculations.         Monetary Policy Report August 2020 Section 3 In Focus The outlook for the labour market 41        3.1 How might the labour market evolve in the second half of 2020?    Bank staff estimate that around 6 million workers were furloughed on average over Q2.  In the first half of the year, Covid-19 caused a sharp reduction in spending, some businesses closed completely for a  time, and social distancing measures made it difficult for employees in some sectors to work (Section 2.4). These  factors meant that a material proportion of the labour force was not working for some or all of the time in Q2.  Given the sharp, temporary nature of some aspects of the shock — for example, mandated business closures — the  Government put in place the CJRS to help support firms and their employees through the period. As a result, most  employees who stopped working were furloughed. This meant they remained attached to their employer, with  wages subsidised by the Government. HMRC data suggest that a total of 9½ million jobs were furloughed at some  stage in recent months. Bank staff estimate that around 6 million workers were on furlough over Q2, on average,  peaking at over 7 million in May.  This has been concentrated in industries hit hardest by the pandemic…  Industries that experienced the largest output falls were those where workers or customers need to be in close  proximity. Industries providing services for social consumption — such as restaurants and hotels — lost nearly all of  their sales during the height of lockdown. Unsurprisingly, these industries made most use of the CJRS (Chart 3.3).    Chart 3.3 Industries hardest hit by Covid-19 have  generally furloughed more of their employees  Falls in output and furlough take-up rate, by sector      Sources: HMRC, ONS and Bank calculations.

(a) Percentage change in output between the average monthly level over 2019 Q4 and  May 2020, inverted.  (b) Output per hour in 2019.    …which tend to be labour-intensive.  The most affected sectors tend to have high labour intensity, employing more workers and less capital for a given  level of output. As a result, they tend to have lower labour productivity (Chart 3.4) and lower pay than average. The  share of workers that have been furloughed was around three times as high in the bottom fifth of the income  distribution than in the top fifth (Chart 3.5).    The rise in unemployment so far has been limited by government schemes and a rise in inactivity.  The CJRS and a reduction in working hours have kept more workers in their jobs than would have otherwise been  the case. The Self‑Employment Income Support Scheme may have caused fewer self-employed workers to be  counted as unemployed over the past few months. In addition, a higher proportion of the reduction in employment  has been reflected in inactivity, rather than unemployment, compared with usual. Lockdown measures, including  school closures, mean that some people who have lost their jobs are likely to have not been actively searching for a  job, or have not been available to start work. As a result, the proportion of those without work and classed as  inactive has increased, which has also limited the rise in unemployment (Section 2.4).

Essential services includes agriculture,  utilities, health, food manufacturing and food wholesale and retail. Other services includes  industries not captured by the other categories.     Support from the CJRS will be unwound during the second half of this year.  Support from the CJRS will be withdrawn gradually over the coming months. Employers are liable to pay National  Insurance and pension contributions for furloughed employees from August, and the proportion of wages covered  by the Government will begin to fall in September. The scheme is scheduled to close at the end of October. The Job  Retention Bonus will pay employers £1,000 — roughly double the average weekly wage — for every previously  furloughed employee who remains continuously employed to the end of January 2021. This will incentivise firms to  keep on previously furloughed employees.     Most furloughed workers should be re-employed as output recovers…  As social distancing measures continue to ease and sales increase, demand for labour should pick up. Indeed, both  the ONS Business Impact of Covid-19 (BICS) and Bank/Ipsos MORI surveys suggest that around a third of furloughed  employees had already returned to work by the end of June. In the July BICS survey, firms expected that more than  half of those previously furloughed would be back at work by the end of the month.    …but some firms in the worst-affected sectors are likely to make some workers redundant…  Some firms, especially those in the worst-affected sectors, are likely to make workers redundant if sales do not pick  up sufficiently quickly. Many firms in highly consumer-facing sectors, manufacturing and construction expect to  reduce their employment materially in Q3 and Q4 (Chart 3.6). Some of these industries are labour-intensive,  employing more workers per unit of output than average. This means the total fall in employment will be higher  than if all industries were reducing their workforces by similar percentages.   …and flows out of unemployment are likely to remain subdued.  At the same time, flows out of unemployment are likely to remain subdued in 2020. The number of vacancies fell to  a record low in Q2 (Chart 3.1) and firms’ reported hiring intentions remain very weak (Chart 3.7). Firms may be  reluctant to make significant hiring decisions this year when the majority do not expect uncertainty about  coronavirus to be resolved until at least next year (Chart 3.8).    More of those out of work may start looking for jobs, pushing up on measured unemployment.  As restrictions are eased and the outlook for the economy improves, the proportion of those without work that are  looking for, and are able to start, a job may return to more usual levels. So rising inactivity among those out of work  may not the limit the rise unemployment to the extent that it did in the first half of the year.     Monetary Policy Report August 2020 Section 3 In Focus The outlook for the labour market 43        Overall, the unemployment rate is expected to rise to 7½% by Q4.  The unemployment rate is expected to peak at around 7½% in Q4, based on survey evidence, high-frequency  indicators, and the historical relationship between unemployment and output. This projection takes into account  the expected sectoral pattern of output and, in particular, that the initial recovery in output is likely to be slower in  more labour-intensive areas of the economy. The forecast is consistent with most furloughed workers returning to  work by the end of the year. The number of people in employment is expected to fall by more than 3% in the  second half of the year, however. This is supported by reports to the Bank’s Agents of planned staff cuts (Box 4).

Responses were collected from 3 to 17 July.    3.2 How long will higher unemployment persist beyond 2020?    Once unemployment has become elevated in the past, it has tended to persist.  After past recessions, the unemployment rate has continued to rise and then remained elevated for a period before  beginning to fall (Chart 3.9). The unemployment rate took seven years to return to pre-recession levels after both  of the past two recessions.  During the financial crisis, the flow of workers from employment to unemployment increased sharply, but half of  that increase had reversed by 2010. In contrast, the recovery in the flow of workers between unemployment and  employment did not take hold fully until 2014 (Chart 3.10). This could reflect a reluctance from firms to start hiring  again, or increased difficulty matching those searching for work with vacancies.     How unemployment evolves beyond 2020 will be closely linked to the recovery in spending…  Firms’ employment intentions and expectations for future sales are closely linked. As demand picks up and firms  are more confident about future sales, this should feed through into lower flows into unemployment and a pickup  in hiring.     …which, given the nature of the Covid-19 shock, could mean the increase is reversed quickly.  The nature of the Covid-19 shock has been different to those that have led to past recessions. The reduction in  spending has been very sharp and closely linked to social distancing measures. As measures are lifted, spending is  expected to pick up relatively quickly. Some types of consumer spending have rebounded strongly already,  although social spending might remain subdued, particularly if fears of infection persist (Section 2.3). In the July  DMP Survey, firms expected the reduction in their sales due to Covid-19 to shrink from around 30% in 2020 Q2 to  8% by 2021 Q1. As a result, unemployment might fall back fairly quickly.

(a) Two-quarter flows. Based on employment and unemployment of people aged 16–64. Data are  to 2019 Q4.  (b) Recessions are defined as at least two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth.    But labour demand could remain subdued because of risk aversion…  Some academic literature attributes cyclical reductions in hiring and investment to a reduction in the desire of  businesses and investors to bear risk during downturns (Di Tella and Hall (2020)). Uncertainty can cause firms to  delay hiring and firing decisions (Bloom et al (2018)). Since these are difficult to reverse, it can be optimal to wait  until uncertainty might be resolved. Over half of firms responding to the July DMP Survey did not expect  uncertainty around Covid-19 to be resolved until after March 2021 (Chart 3.8). This channel is likely to be weaker in  sectors which tend to hire lower skilled workers, as hiring costs generally increase with skill requirements (Blatter  et al (2012)).  Credit constraints can also cause firms to behave more cautiously. A firm that has built up debt during a recession  may be unable or unwilling to take out further credit. This can make them less likely to hire new workers (Kehoe et  al (2019)).   …which can also affect firm entry and exit.  These factors will also affect the number of new businesses being formed. Younger firms are an important source  of new jobs, so hiring is likely to fall if fewer new firms start up. Lower employment from new firm entrants appears  to account for just under half of the overall fall in employment during the financial crisis. There is mixed evidence to  date on how Covid-19 has affected firm creation: new VAT registrations fell by around 20% in Q2, but the number  of new companies incorporated has held up. Firm start-ups may be less affected than following the financial crisis,  as the costs of entry tend to be lower for businesses in the sectors that have been worst hit by Covid-19. Access to  credit has also been a key determinant of firm entry in the past, and corporate credit conditions do not appear to  have tightened substantially in recent months (Section 2.2).     Firm exits also affect labour demand but it is more difficult to assess the scale of the role they play. According to  Labour Force Survey data, firm closure only accounted for a small amount of the spike in redundancies in the  financial crisis. But these data may not capture the full impact of firm failure, as firms may be able to survive  temporarily by reducing employment before subsequently failing.     Changes in the pool of unemployed people might also reduce the job-finding rate…  While labour demand determines the number of vacancies, economic shocks can also change the composition of  the pool of unemployed people, lowering the chances of a given vacancy being filled. As a result, a given  unemployment rate will exert less downward pressure on wages and so cause the unemployment rate consistent  with stable wage pressures to rise.      Monetary Policy Report August 2020 Section 3 In Focus The outlook for the labour market 45        …if there are mismatches between vacancies and those looking for work…  If those in unemployment are not a good match for the vacancies which arise, the job-finding rate will fall, slowing  the fall in unemployment (Şahin et al (2014)). Mismatch can be across various dimensions, for example sectors or  skills.     Mismatch in the labour market could increase if some sectors do not restore employment to previous levels as  quickly as others. Responses to the July DMP Survey suggest employment expectations differ materially across  industries. Highly consumer-facing services expect employment to be 11% lower in 2021 Q1 than it would have  been without Covid-19, compared with 3% for essential services (Chart 3.6).     There may also be mismatch between the skills of the unemployed and those required by hiring firms. Many of the  roles that non-graduate recent education leavers typically enter first are sectors that have experienced the largest  reductions in output (Henehan (2020)). While more experienced or skilled workers could choose to move down the  skills spectrum to find a job in a different sector, it is much harder to move up the spectrum as it takes time to build  skills. This mechanism can prolong unemployment (Haldane (2020)).    The extent of any labour market mismatch will depend on how long the differential impact of Covid-19 across  sectors persists and how quickly people can build new skills. If this fades next year, any mismatch might be  relatively short-lived. In the July DMP Survey, the differences across sectors between the estimated impacts of  Covid-19 on sales were expected to narrow substantially by Q1 2021. But the impact of Covid-19 across sectors  could be more persistent if the pandemic results in more structural changes to the economy — for example, in the  ways and places that goods and services are consumed.     …and, over time, an increase in long-term unemployment.  During periods of high unemployment, the number of unemployed people who have been out of work for a  prolonged period typically increases (Chart 3.9). As workers experience longer spells of unemployment, the  likelihood they will find a job falls (Krueger et al (2014)). This could be because the skills of unemployed workers  deteriorate as they are not used. They may also reduce the intensity of their job search over time.     3.3 The MPC’s projection for unemployment     Based on the data discussed in Section 3.1, the unemployment rate is expected to peak at around 7½% in Q4. The  MPC judges that unemployment is likely to decline thereafter, reflecting the nature of the Covid-19 shock and the  policies put in place to support households and businesses.     As discussed in Section 3.2, heightened uncertainty about Covid-19 is expected to weigh on labour demand, so  hiring picks up relatively slowly. In addition, the MPC judges that there is likely to be some reduction in the  efficiency with which people can find jobs. That tends to happen as unemployment rises, as some people take time  to find new jobs, and their skills erode. Moreover, in the present conjuncture, the differential impact of Covid-19 on  economic activity across sectors is judged likely to create a greater degree of mismatch than usual between the  sectors from which workers have been made unemployed and the sectors in which firms are posting vacancies.  That is expected to slow the pace of the decline in unemployment and also lead to a rise in the medium-term  equilibrium rate of unemployment, such that not all of the increase in unemployment reflects labour market slack.  The long-term equilibrium rate of unemployment is not assumed to rise, however. This is usually affected by  slow-moving structural features of the economy such as demographics and technological change (see Box 4 of the  February 2018 Inflation Report).     The risks around these projections, such as the potential for greater long-lasting effects on the supply side of the  economy, are discussed in Section 1.      Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 4 In focus Spare capacity and domestic price pressures   46        4 In focus Spare capacity and  domestic price pressures  The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a greater degree of spare capacity in the economy,  although there may be large differences across sectors. The increase in spare capacity is  likely to weigh on domestic prices. However, the relationship between spare capacity  and prices may be weaker than usual, and some sectors will have higher costs.  The spread of Covid-19 and the measures to contain it have led to a marked drop in economic activity around the  world. In the UK, output is expected to have fallen by more than 20% over the first half of the year (Section 2). The  fall in output has reflected lower demand for goods and services, as well as a reduction in the economy’s supply  capacity. Although a recovery is now underway, the MPC expects the economy’s output to remain below its  potential level for over a year. The difference between output and its potential level is spare capacity.    Spare capacity matters for monetary policy because it affects the outlook for growth, employment and inflation.  There can be spare capacity within firms or in the labour market. Higher levels of spare capacity within firms put  downward pressure on inflation because firms may want to boost demand for their goods and services by lowering  prices. Spare capacity in the labour market means there is less pressure to offer higher wages to attract and retain  staff. This In Focus examines the outlook for spare capacity and domestic price pressures in more detail. Box 5  discusses some issues with the measurement of consumer price inflation at this time.    4.1   The impact of Covid-19 on spare capacity    The level of spare capacity in the economy at the moment is unusually uncertain.  The large declines in both demand and supply across the UK economy in recent months make it very difficult to  judge the level of spare capacity. The demand for goods and services from consumers fell sharply during the first  half of the year and, despite some recent recovery, remains well below pre-Covid levels (Section 2.3). However, the  supply of goods and services has also been restricted during this period, including by government-mandated  business closures. Around a quarter of businesses reported being temporarily closed in early April, although that  proportion has since fallen to below 10% (Chart 4.1).     The large number of employees on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) also makes it difficult to see the  extent of underlying spare capacity in the labour market. Bank staff estimate that, on average, around 4½ million  people were on furlough over the three months to May (Chart 4.2), peaking at over 7 million in the single month of  May. These workers remain employed but have been working no hours or — from 1 July — a fraction of their usual  hours. Most of these people will be working fewer hours than they would otherwise choose to, so are, in a sense, a  form of spare capacity. However, it is unlikely that many of these people are actively searching for new jobs, as  most expect to return to their usual hours with their existing employer. As a result, the economic impact of  furloughing is closer to a temporary reduction in supply.     But the MPC expects unemployment to increase over the coming months…  As more businesses are allowed to reopen and the CJRS is wound down, the extent of spare capacity is likely to  become clearer. In the MPC’s projections, unemployment rises to around 7½% by the end of the year as some  workers are made redundant and hiring remains subdued (Section 3). That would represent around 2½ million  people out of work and searching for jobs (Chart 4.2), the highest total since 2013, and a clear sign of spare  capacity in the economy.

March-May 2020 figures for ‘furloughed’ and ‘in work’ are Bank staff  estimates based on analysis of the LFS, administrative data, and a range of business surveys.  A relatively small number of furloughed workers over 2020 Q4 (reflecting workers expected to  be on the scheme in October) are included as ‘in work’.    …and there are likely to be other forms of spare capacity in the labour market.  Unemployment is not the only form of spare capacity in the labour market. Some people who lose their job may  not look for a new job immediately and will be classified as ‘inactive’, but will begin to look for work when the  lockdown eases or hiring picks up. As a result, they are a form of spare capacity in the labour market. The pool of  people who are not currently in or seeking work, but who report they would like a job has already grown  significantly; the sharp pickup in the ‘marginal attachment’ ratio between February and May (Chart 4.3) more than  accounted for the increase in inactivity over that period (Chart 4.2).

Sectors are  weighted using shares in gross value added. The BCC data are not seasonally adjusted.    Spare capacity within firms may also increase…  There may also be spare capacity in the form of capital, such as buildings and machinery, not being fully utilised  over the coming months. Survey measures of capacity utilisation have already fallen sharply (Chart 4.4): in the  BCC’s Q2 survey fewer than 20% of firms in both the manufacturing and services sectors reported working at full  capacity, the lowest levels since 1993. Some survey responses may reflect temporary closures — in which case they   Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 4 In focus Spare capacity and domestic price pressures   48        actually reflect temporary reductions in supply, rather than increases in spare capacity. But as those firms reopen,  supply capacity will increase, and a degree of under-utilisation could persist.     …although some firms may have reduced capacity to supply.  Some firms’ supply capacity might continue to be constrained over coming months, however, as a result of  measures to reduce the risk of virus transmission. Some shops and restaurants are limiting customer numbers to  allow for social distancing, and some businesses such as dentists and barbers must do extra cleaning in between  customers. In addition, some firms may be experiencing reduced productivity as they adapt business practices to  accommodate widespread working from home (Haskel (2020)), or because of disruption to their supply chains.     There are likely to be large differences across sectors.  There are likely to be significant differences in capacity utilisation across sectors. The pandemic and the measures  to contain it have most affected sectors where workers or customers are typically in close proximity.  Consumer-facing services, such as recreational services and accommodation and food, expect the largest hit to  sales in Q3 as a result of Covid-19. Some of this may reflect lower demand and lead to spare capacity. However,  these sectors also expect the largest reductions in supply capacity because of measures to contain Covid-19  (Chart 4.5). The manufacturing and construction sectors expect smaller hits to sales, but the reductions are  expected to be larger than the declines in capacity, implying lower levels of utilisation. The differences in the  impact of Covid-19 might interact with other differences between sectors — such as the frequency with which  prices are changed, or the mix of inputs used in production — to affect how any spare capacity influences inflation.

(a) Implied price changes are calculated by dividing retail sales values by volumes.    4.2   The impact of spare capacity on domestic price pressures    The extent of any spare capacity will be an important influence on inflation in the medium term.   In the near term, movements in CPI inflation are expected to be largely driven by energy prices and the temporary  reduction in VAT for the hospitality sector (Section 2.4). Looking further ahead, the extent of any spare capacity and  its relationship with domestic prices pressures will be key influences on inflation. Firms that have spare capacity  may lower prices to boost demand. Unemployment and other forms of spare capacity in the labour market will put  downward pressure on wage growth; this will lower firms’ cost growth and therefore weigh on price inflation.  However, some aspects of the pandemic may push prices up. In particular, some sectors may have higher operating  costs as a result of measures to limit the risk of virus transmission.      Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 4 In focus Spare capacity and domestic price pressures   49        Consumer demand is expected to remain weak, which will put downward pressure on inflation.  Since the outbreak of Covid-19, both sales and prices of retail goods have generally been lower than earlier in the  year, although there was a partial recovery between May and June as more shops were allowed to reopen  (Chart 4.6). In the consumer services sector, the Bank’s Agents’ score for prices fell to a record low in July. The  weakness of consumer prices could indicate that demand fell by more than supply over this time. But it could also  reflect the fact that many businesses were temporarily closed, and shops which were open had unusual levels of  excess stock to sell. For example, the Agents report that some clothing retailers have been offering significant  discounts to clear seasonal stock. In addition, some goods and services may have become cheaper because of the  lower price of energy (Section 2.4).    Looking ahead, although consumer spending has begun to recover from its trough in April, demand is expected to  remain subdued over the coming months. Consumer confidence remains well below average, and people may be  nervous about resuming some forms of spending, such as eating out (Section 2.3). Agency contacts in the retail  sector do not expect demand to return to normal for several months, and firms reliant on tourism expect an even  longer period of poor trading. This shortfall in demand may mean there is pressure on firms to lower prices. This  would be consistent with the behaviour of inflation after past pandemics, although differences in policy responses  make comparisons difficult (Tenreyro (2020)).    Labour cost growth is likely to be limited, although the earnings data will be clouded in the short run.  There is likely to be less pressure to increase wages because of a larger pool of unemployed workers over the  coming months (Section 3). Labour is a significant input in the production of almost all goods and services, so this  will reduce pressure on firms to increase prices, particularly for labour-intensive sectors, including some consumer  services. The size of this impact may be hard to judge in the short term as the earnings data are expected to be  affected by one-off effects, including the CJRS and the changing composition of the workforce (Section 2.4). But a  range of surveys suggest pressures to increase pay have fallen sharply, and the Agents report that pay freezes and  pay cuts have become more common recently.    However, many of the sectors hit hardest by the pandemic have ‘stickier’ prices than average.  Covid-19 has affected sectors differently, and that may interact with existing differences to reduce the impact of  spare capacity on inflation. Some of the worst hit sectors are consumer services, but the prices of consumer  services tend to change less frequently than those of goods (Chart 4.7), a pattern previously observed in the UK  (Bunn and Ellis (2011)) and elsewhere (Klenow and Malin (2010)). As a result, any spare capacity in these sectors  may have a smaller, or more delayed, impact on inflation (Carvalho (2006)). Sectors which remain closed are not  able to adjust their prices at all (Box 5).

Shaded areas  show 68% confidence intervals.     Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 4 In focus Spare capacity and domestic price pressures   50        Uncertainty about the economic outlook may cause firms to hold off changing their prices.   Elevated uncertainty might also reduce the sensitivity of inflation to changes in spare capacity. Firms may expect  the current shock to demand to be temporary and choose not to change prices to avoid having to reverse the  changes when conditions improve. Various models of price-setting have the feature that firms are less likely to  change prices when they are more uncertain about the state of the economy (Woodford (2011)).     Inflation appears to be less responsive to unemployment when demand is weak.  In the past, inflation has been less responsive to spare capacity at times when demand has been very low. Bank  staff estimate that the impact after a year of an increase in unemployment on core services prices — a common  measure of domestic price pressures — when output growth is weak is around half the size of the impact when  output growth is strong (Chart 4.8). This could be because firms are less able to create increased demand by  lowering prices when consumers are less willing to spend. Large price cuts can actually lower profits if demand rises  only a little (Lindé and Trabandt (2019)). Firms may also have liquidity constraints as a result of sharp falls in their  cash flow. These might discourage them from cutting prices, as they prioritise short-term revenue generation  (Gilchrist et al (2017)).     And some sectors may see costs rise or their capacity reduced, offsetting downward price pressure.  Some sectors may have higher costs as a result of measures to limit the risks of virus transmission, offsetting any  downward pressure on prices from weak demand. Businesses have had to make their premises ‘Covid-secure’. This  may involve staff using protective equipment and cleaning surfaces more often. Similarly, some firms may need to  constrain supply to reduce the risk of transmission (Section 4.1), meaning their fixed costs will be spread across a  lower level of business.    These measures will add to firms’ unit costs — the cost of producing one unit of output — which they may need to  pass on to consumers to maintain profitability. Firms responding to the DMP Survey expected Covid-19 to increase  their unit costs by an average of 7% in Q3 (Chart 4.9). The sectors most affected were the accommodation, food,  and recreational services sectors.     Chart 4.9 Covid-19 is expected to increase unit costs  sharply in some consumer service sectors  Expected impact of Covid-19 on unit costs in 2020 Q3 by sector(a)        Sources: DMP Survey and Bank calculations.

Data shown are  three-month averages.    Surveys suggest inflationary pressures have weakened.  Despite some sectors facing higher costs, surveys of firms suggest inflationary pressures have weakened overall.  Price expectations in the CBI and BCC services surveys have fallen over the past few months, with the latter survey  balance falling to its lowest level since 2009. In the DMP Survey, the average expected change in prices over the  next year had fallen from 2.3% at the start of the year to 1.6% in the three months to July (Chart 4.10).  Expectations in the accommodation and food sectors had fallen particularly sharply. This might suggest the   Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Section 4 In focus Spare capacity and domestic price pressures   51        influence of weaker demand is expected to outweigh any unit costs increases, although price expectations will also  be affected by other factors.     4.3   The MPC’s projections for spare capacity and inflation    The reduction in output in recent months has reflected declines in both the demand for goods and services as well  as the economy’s supply capacity, and the balance between the two is difficult to gauge. Overall, the MPC judges  that a material amount of additional spare capacity has emerged, and this will be predominately in the form of  increased unemployment towards the end of the year. Although there may also be spare capacity within some  firms, others will have a reduced capacity to supply because of new working practices.    Spare capacity in the economy is expected to weigh on domestic price pressures. However, based on the analysis  outlined in this section, the MPC expect the impact of spare capacity on inflation to be a little smaller than usual. In  the near term, inflation is expected to remain well below the 2% target, reflecting the continued drag from lower  energy prices and the temporary cut in VAT for the hospitality sector.      Demand is projected to recover over the forecast period, eroding the degree of spare capacity and causing  domestic price pressures to strengthen. Inflation is projected to return to target during 2022. Section 1 contains  more detail on the MPC’s projections.     Box 5   Measuring consumer price inflation during Covid-19  The spread of Covid-19 and the measures to contain it have presented a range of issues for the measurement of  consumer price inflation. These have not significantly impaired the signal from the overall CPI inflation rate, but do  mean some component-level inflation rates should be interpreted with care.     The biggest issue for data collection has been that, from April, some products have been unavailable to buy, such  as cinema tickets and haircuts. The ONS identified 67 unavailable items in June representing around 17% of the  CPI basket by weight. In these cases, the rate of inflation was set equal to the rate of inflation in the rest of the  CPI basket. Bank staff estimate this might have reduced measured CPI inflation very slightly, by around  0.2 percentage points in June, compared to a counterfactual in which the omitted prices rose in line with their  previous trends.    A smaller issue is that the prices of some products, despite being generally available for consumers, were harder to  collect. In line with government guidelines, the ONS has been encouraging staff to work from home and to avoid  unnecessary travel and social contact. A greater use of phone calls and websites has successfully replaced some  store visits. But there has been a reduction in the availability of some items. In the few cases where the sample of  prices has not been large enough for a robust average, the ONS has inferred the rate of inflation from a similar  product or a wider product class. In June, only nine items received this treatment.     A potentially more significant issue is that households are buying a very different mix of goods and services to  normal at the moment. This has prompted interest in alternative measures of consumer price inflation that use  expenditure shares closer to those prevailing today. Although these measures are conceptually different to  CPI inflation — which uses past expenditure shares by design — they generally show inflation rates similar to  CPI inflation. Cavallo’s (2020) measure of UK ‘Covid inflation’ was less than 0.1 percentage point above CPI inflation  in May, although differences were larger for the US. Dixon and Levell’s (2020) measure of UK ‘lockdown-weighted’  CPIH inflation was 0.3 percentage points higher than CPIH inflation in April, although the changes in the inflation  rates since the start of the year have been very similar.      Monetary Policy Report August 2020   Annex Other forecasters’ expectations   52        Annex  Other forecasters’ expectations  This annex reports the results of the Bank’s most recent survey of external forecasters, summarised in Table 1. (1)     On average, respondents expected GDP to rise sharply in 2020 Q3 (Chart A). The unemployment rate was expected  to rise and, on average, CPI inflation was expected to be weak, falling to below 0.5%. The range of projections was  wide, reflecting, in part, continued uncertainty around the economic impact of Covid-19.

Chart A In 2020 Q3, GDP and unemployment were  expected to rise, and CPI inflation to fall below 0.5%  Averages of other forecasters’ central projections for GDP, the  unemployment rate and CPI inflation in 2020 Q3          Further ahead, respondents expected strong GDP growth in the four quarters to 2021 Q3, as output recovers from  the sharp falls this year. Four-quarter GDP growth was then expected to be around 2% in the medium term (left  panel, Chart B). The unemployment rate was expected to fall gradually over the forecast, to around 5% on average  (middle panel, Chart B). CPI inflation was expected to rise towards the MPC’s 2% target (right panel, Chart B).    On average, respondents expected a further increase in the stock of purchased gilts of about £65 billion over the  next year, in addition to the increase announced by the MPC in June which took the total stock of asset purchases  to £745 billion (Table 1).    Chart B At the three-year horizon, external forecasters expect GDP growth to be around 2%, the unemployment rate to  fall to around 5%, and inflation to be close to the MPC’s 2% target  Projections for GDP, the unemployment rate and CPI inflation      1   For detailed distributions, see ‘Other forecasters’ expectations’.
