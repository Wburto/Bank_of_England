2002-11-13,"Inflation Report November 2002 The Inflation Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff under the guidance of the members of the Monetary Policy Committee.  It serves two purposes.  First, its preparation provides a comprehensive and forward-looking framework for discussion among MPC members as an aid to our decision making.  Second, its publication allows us to share our thinking and explain the reasons for our decisions to those whom they affect. Although not every member will agree with every assumption on which our projections are based, the fan charts represent the MPC’s best collective judgment about the most likely paths for inflation and output, and the uncertainties surrounding those central projections. This Report has been prepared and published by the  Bank of England in accordance with section 1 8 of the  Bank of England Act 1 998. The Monetary Policy Committee: Eddie George, Governor Mervyn King, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy Andrew Large, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Christopher Allsopp Kate Barker Charles Bean Marian Bell Stephen Nickell Paul Tucker The Overview of this Inflation Report is available on the Bank’s web site at www.bankofengland.co.uk/inflationreport/infrep.htm  The entire Report is available in PDF at www.bankofengland.co.uk/inflationrep/index.html  i The global economic recovery remains patchy.  In the United States, output growth picked up in the third quarter, as consumers increased purchases of motor vehicles in response to generous financing deals.  But that stimulus is likely to prove temporary and a drop in consumer confidence suggests household spending could moderate.  The euro area has experienced below-par growth in output, with sluggish consumer spending and weak business investment holding back domestic demand.  Japan has seen a modest pick-up in activity, led by external demand, but prospects there remain subdued. However, strong domestic demand has ensured output growth has held up relatively well in a number of other Asian economies. Global equity prices fell sharply again during late summer, but regained most of that lost ground in October.  Notwithstanding the recent rise, equity indices stand well below their levels at the start of the year and there is considerable uncertainty about the impact of that correction on future consumer spending and investment.  The Federal Reserve has cut official interest rates by 0.5 percentage points, while official rates have remained unchanged in the other major economies.  In the face of the continued accommodative monetary stance, market interest rates have softened and that will help to counteract any weakness in global activity.  The Committee continues to expect UK-weighted world demand to strengthen gradually.  But although prospects are broadly the same as in the August Inflation Report, there are significant risks to the outlook. In the United Kingdom, GDP is provisionally estimated to have risen by 0.7% in Q3, slightly up on the second-quarter growth rate, although the impact of the Jubilee holidays has masked the The recovery in the world economy remains fragile and global stock markets have continued to be volatile. In the United Kingdom, quarterly output growth has picked up to around trend.  The consumer continues to be the primary engine of growth in demand.  That has been associated with rapid house price inflation and accelerating household borrowing.  The Committee’s central projection at the current level of official interest rates is for four-quarter GDP growth to settle at around trend over the next two years.  Pay pressures remain subdued.  Annual RPIX inflation averaged 2.0% in the third quarter.  It is projected to move above the 2.5% target in the near term, dip slightly below it towards the end of next year, and then edge back up towards target as the two-year horizon approaches.  Significant risks to the outlook for growth and inflation remain. Overview  Inflation Report: November 2002 ii underlying trends in some of the constituent series.  So while output in the manufacturing sector expanded by over 1% in the third quarter, the underlying trend since Q1 appears to have been broadly flat.  The Jubilee effects were probably rather less significant for the services sector, which grew by 0.8% in Q3. Taking the second and third quarters together, the underlying picture is one of around-trend output growth. The growth in consumers’ expenditure picked up sharply to 1.3% in the second quarter, though some of that may reflect the timing of Easter.  More muted growth is likely to have occurred in Q3, but record levels of consumers’ confidence in their own financial position and rapid growth in borrowing suggest that the outlook is for spending to remain strong in the near term. The resilience of consumer spending in recent quarters has been associated with a rise in annual house price inflation to around 25%–30%.  That has allowed owner-occupiers to increase their secured borrowing, thus supporting consumer demand and offsetting the impact of lower equity prices.  But recent rates of house price inflation are unsustainable. Together with slowing growth in real disposable incomes and lower equity wealth, slower house price inflation would act to dampen future spending growth. Underlying government spending has been rising strongly, though recent quarterly movements have been erratic. Government consumption in Q2 was 4.6% up on a year earlier, while capital spending was almost 12% higher.  Continued strong growth in public expenditure is planned for the next two years. Business investment was little changed in Q2, but around 1 1% lower than a year earlier after especially sharp falls around the turn of last year.  Sufficient capacity, weak profitability, pressures on corporate balance sheets and subdued investment intentions all point to a sluggish near-term outlook for capital spending.  Destocking reduced second-quarter growth, but that may have been partly related to the Jubilee and some reversal is likely to have happened in Q3. Net exports boosted growth in the second quarter, but recent movements in exports and imports have been erratic and trade data point to a return to a negative contribution in Q3.  In every year since 1 996, net exports have detracted from growth, though improved terms of trade have limited the impact on the current account deficit. Chart 1 shows the MPC’s assessment of the outlook for GDP growth, on the benchmark assumption that the official interest rate remains at 4.0%.  Under the central projection, robust consumer demand pushes four-quarter GDP growth up to a  Overview iii little above trend early next year.  Growth then settles back, as a deceleration of household spending offsets a recovery in external demand, higher public expenditure and a modest  pick-up in business investment.  The profile for output growth is broadly similar to that shown in the August Report. Among other factors, inflationary pressure depends upon the balance of demand relative to supply in labour and product markets.  The employment rate has changed little through the slowdown, as job losses in manufacturing have been offset by increased recruitment in the public sector and construction, though some easing in underlying labour demand is suggested by the decline in total hours worked.  In the three months to August, the ILO unemployment rate was 5.2%, just  0.3 percentage points above its May 2001 trough.  Along with other indicators, that suggests only a slight easing in labour market tightness.  Headline earnings growth has been running at a little under 4% since May, but may soon edge up as the delayed local authority pay settlement takes effect. Growth in productivity per head had been unusually weak during the slowdown—though productivity per hour held up better—but the growth of unit wage costs has eased as output growth has picked up.  Concerns about the possibility of military action in Iraq produced a spike in oil prices, and increases over the course of this year are now working through into input costs.  While there are significant differences across sectors, survey measures and other indicators suggest that capacity utilisation is, on average, a little below normal.  RPIX inflation ticked up to 2.0% in Q3, though monthly movements remain volatile.  The marked divergence between goods and services price inflation has persisted, reflecting sectoral differences in market conditions as well as in productivity growth. Chart 2 shows the Committee’s assessment of the outlook for RPIX inflation.  In the central projection, inflation rises above the 2.5% target by the end of this year reflecting the impact of higher oil prices and an unusually high contribution from housing depreciation.  It remains at that higher level for most  of next year, and then drops a little below target as those influences unwind, subsequently edging back up as the two-year horizon approaches.  Compared with the August Report, the profile is rather higher in the first year and slightly lower during the second year. Among the many uncertainties surrounding these projections, the Committee identified a number of particular risks.  First, that US consumer spending might falter and the euro area remain sluggish, thus threatening the global recovery.  Second, that the exceptional rate of house price inflation might Chart 2 Current RPIX inflation projection based  on constant nominal interest rates at 4% 0 1 2 3 4 5 Percentage increase in prices on a year earlier 2.5 1998 99 2000 01 02 03 04 The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for RPIX inflation in the future.

Inflation Report: November 2002 iv continue for a while yet, leading ultimately to a more abrupt slowdown in both house price inflation and consumer spending growth.  Third, that the pass-through into wages and prices of the increase in National Insurance contributions next spring might be greater than in the central projection.  The crystallisation of any of these risks could have material implications for the prospects for growth and inflation, and thus for policy.  But, overall, the Committee judges that, relative to the central projection, the balance of risks to growth is weighted somewhat to the downside, with those to inflation slightly on the upside. At its November meeting, the Committee noted that, although uneven, the profile for inflation under the central projection remained close to target over the forecast period.  Bearing in mind the substantial risks, the Committee judged that it was at present appropriate to leave official interest rates at 4%.  But the Committee observed that prompt action might be required if any of those risks appeared to be crystallising.

In the period between 3 1 July and 6 November, the price of a broad basket of UK equities varied by almost 20%—the FTSE All-Share index reached a peak of 2 1 47 in late August, and a low of 1783 in late September.  For most of the time, other major equity price indices followed paths similar to that of the FTSE All-Share, which suggests that some of the factors driving equity markets were global in nature (see Chart 1.1).  Equity price movements have been large in comparison to news about some of the factors that ought to be driving them—for example, expectations of corporate earnings growth over the medium term have changed little in recent months.  This, together with high measures of implied volatility as derived from options prices, suggests that market participants have been very uncertain about the valuation to place on equities.  The average of the FTSE All-Share index in the 1 5 working days up until 6 November was 1 955, close to its average of 1 985 in the 1 5 working days up until 3 1 July.  The starting point for the equity price projection contained in this Report is a little below the starting point used in August. Although the overall change in UK equity prices during the past three months has been small, by 6 November, when data for this Report were finalised, the FTSE All-Share index had fallen more than 20% since the beginning of the year, and was 40% below its value at the end of 1 999.  Chart 1.2 shows how Global equity prices rose a little following publication of the August Inflation Report, but then fell sharply during September.  Most indices have now recovered to stand at levels close to those seen three months previously.  There have also been large fluctuations in the prices of government bonds, with equity prices and bond yields tracking each other closely. Some early indicators point to a possible slowdown in housing market activity.  But this has not yet fed through to weaker house price inflation—the annual rate in October looks to have been somewhere in the range 25%–30%.  Household borrowing has accelerated.  In Q2, less than half the total amount of secured borrowing was invested in the housing stock.  It is likely that most of the remainder was used to fund additional consumption.

Inflation Report: November 2002 4 UK equity prices have changed, in real terms, since 1 91 5. Although dominated by the collapse in real equity prices during 1 973 and 1 97 4, the recent decline has been large by post-war standards.  And it unwound much of the real increase that had occurred between January 1 992 and December 1 999. Monetary policy On 7 November, the MPC maintained the Bank of England repo rate at 4%.  This two-week official interest rate has now been left unchanged for a year.  On 6 November, the  US Federal Open Market Committee reduced its target for the federal funds rate by 0.5 percentage points to 1.25%.  Official interest rates in the euro area have remained unchanged since the August Report. Policy-makers have an interest in knowing what financial market participants expect will happen to the official rate of interest.  These expectations affect the terms on which individuals can both lend and borrow money.  Moreover, when policy-makers are informed about what people expect them to do, it can help them to judge whether the actual policy decision will be a surprise, and hence what influence it might have on other financial market prices, and on the economy. Each day, Bank staff estimate two nominal forward interest rate curves—known as the government liability curve and the commercial bank liability (CBL) curve—from which information about financial market expectations can be obtained.(1) But this is not a straightforward exercise. The government liability curve is based on a combination of general collateral (GC) repo rates with a maturity of up to six months, and gilt yields.(2) Interest rates implied by the government liability curve are often thought to approximate risk-free interest rates.  The commercial bank liability curve is fitted through a sequence of rates at which commercial banks lend money to each other on an unsecured basis, known as London Interbank Offer Rates (or Libor), and a number of derivative instruments that settle against Libor.  In the period since the August Inflation Report, both curves have shifted down and to the right (see Chart 1.3).  One interpretation is that, by 6 November, financial market participants believed that the timing of an official interest rate rise had been further delayed. The government liability curve, as derived, can be an imperfect measure of expectations about the official two-week repo rate, if the yields on particular gilts are affected by fluctuations in Chart 1.3 Two-week forward interest rates(a) 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0 July 2002 Jan.  03 July  Jan. 04 July  Per cent CBL 31 July (b) CBL 6 Nov.

(a) Equity prices are measured at the end of each month and deflated by an RPI series that has been seasonally adjusted by the Bank.   The chart ends in September 2002, which is the final data point for the RPI. (1) The government liability curve has previously been referred to in the Inflation Report as the GC repo/gilt curve.  Estimates of both the government liability curve and the commercial bank liability curve are published daily on the Bank of England web site at www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/yieldcurve/main.htm (2) A GC repo rate is the rate that one financial institution pays to borrow money from another when it effectively offers any gilt as security against the risk of default.

Interest rates implied by the commercial bank liability curve incorporate a time-varying credit risk premium, to compensate for the risk of default on unsecured loans to private sector organisations.  In addition, both curves are affected by term premia, which tend to widen the gap between the implied forward rate and the expected policy rate at longer maturities. Each curve can give misleading signals about market expectations of official rates from time to time, but the large movements down and to the right shown in Chart 1.3 are likely to be significant nonetheless. In the week before each regular monthly meeting of the MPC, Reuters conducts a survey of economists working in the financial sector.  Such surveys, though less timely than information obtained from financial market prices, are still helpful because they provide a direct measure of expectations. In the most recent survey, published on 3 1 October, 1 8 of the 32 respondents expected that the Bank of England repo rate would be left unchanged at the meeting on 6 and 7 November. The average expected rate for the end of 2002, at 3.87%, was a little below the current repo rate.  The rate expected for the end of 2003 was 4.45%.  These forecasts were both around half a percentage point lower than the equivalent forecasts published on 25 July.  All of the available evidence suggests that expectations of the two-week Bank of England repo rate during the next twelve months or so, have fallen since the August Report.  Survey-based measures of inflation expectations have tended to fall too (see Section 4), though by a smaller amount, so the short-term real rate of interest has probably fallen. Government bond yields The Government liability curve, and a real forward interest rate curve derived from index-linked gilt yields, provide measures of the implied rates, both nominal and real, at which financial markets would be willing to lend to the UK government at different points of time in the future.  The rates at which households and firms can borrow money will be related to these forward interest rates, but will generally be higher. Chart 1.4 shows that, by 6 November, nominal forward interest rates had fallen by around 0.2 percentage points at maturities up to five years, but were broadly unchanged further out.  There had been little movement in real forward interest rates. Just as equity prices have varied substantially during the past three months, so too have gilt yields, with the ten-year nominal Chart 1.4 Nominal and real forward rate curves(a) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 5 10 15 20 25 Nominal 31 July Nominal 6 Nov.

Inflation Report: November 2002 6 yield reaching a high of 4.8% and a low of 4.4%.  Chart 1.5 shows how UK equity prices have moved closely in line with gilt yields since May, with both tending to fall.  This pattern is consistent with an increase in equity risk resulting from greater uncertainty about equity returns.  If investors started to demand less risky assets, such as gilts, that would lead to a rise in their price and a fall in their yield.  News about growth prospects might also produce the kind of relationship apparent in Chart 1.5, with a weaker economic outlook leading to expectations that dividend payments would be lower and monetary policy looser. Exchange rates With the exception of the Japanese yen, effective exchange rate indices for most major currencies have been broadly stable since the August Report (see Chart 1.6).  This is also consistent with the view that the major events driving financial markets have been international in nature.  The amount of uncertainty surrounding the position in twelve months’ time of the sterling/US dollar, and particularly the sterling/euro bilateral exchange rates, as measured by implied volatilities, has declined since the beginning of the year (see Chart 1.7). Property prices When preparing the projections published in the August Inflation Report, the Committee judged that house price inflation would slow markedly over the next two years, to reach a level a little below the growth rate of nominal earnings.  Are there any signs that a slowdown in the housing market has begun? The diagram opposite, based on a survey conducted on behalf of the former Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR), depicts the approximate timing of events that led up to a typical house purchase in 1 998.(1) According to the survey, the median time interval between deciding to look for a property and completing the transaction was then around five months.  The median time interval between securing a mortgage approval and completing the transaction was five to six weeks. Table 1.A lists some measures of housing market activity.  Some of the early indicators in the chain began to slow down in the third quarter.  In particular, the balance of respondents to the House Builders Federation survey reporting more net reservations was lower in July and August than during the first half of the year.  Although there was some rebound in the September figure, it remained below the averages for Q1 and Q2.  There was a small reduction in the number of loan approvals in Q3.

Money and asset prices 7 Because lenders record house prices at the mortgage approval stage, one might expect to see an approximately contemporaneous relationship between housing market activity, as measured by the number of approvals, and the  rate of change of house prices.  But monthly house price inflation can be quite erratic.  It declined, on the Halifax measure, from 1.8% in July to 0.2% in August, only to rise again to 4.4% in September, and 4.7% in October—the strongest one-month increase since the data were first collected in 1 983 (see Chart 1.8).  Consequently, economic commentators tend to focus on annual measures.  Chart 1.9 shows that mortgage approvals have tended to lead annual house price inflation. Putting together data from both the Halifax and the Nationwide, house price inflation in the year to October appears to have been somewhere in the range 25%–30%.

Inflation Report: November 2002 8 the time of the August Report, and is clearly unsustainable. By region, house price inflation in London and the South East has recently been a little below the national average.  In  the year to Q3 the most rapid house price increases  occurred in the Midlands, followed by the South West and  East Anglia (see Chart 1.10).  In light of the tentative signs  of an easing in housing market activity, the Committee continues to anticipate that house price inflation will soon begin to slow. According to the Investment Property Databank, the capital value of commercial property rose by just 2.0% in the year to September.  Commercial property prices have risen much more slowly than residential property prices for the past  two years, reflecting the relative weakness of the corporate sector. 1.2 Money and credit(1) Monetary aggregates The rates of growth of seasonally adjusted notes and coin and M0 have been quite volatile in recent months, largely reflecting unusual patterns of economic activity associated with the timing of Easter and the Jubilee celebrations  (see Section 2).  In the year to 2002 Q2, the stock of M0 rose by 9.5% (see Table 1.B).  At the same time, nominal household expenditure increased by just 4.7%.  The box on page 9 of this Report suggests that M0 could continue to grow more quickly than consumption for some time to come. Aggregate M4, the sum of notes and coin and sterling deposits with UK banks and building societies held by households, private non-financial corporations (PNFCs) and other financial corporations (OFCs), rose by 5.4% in the year to 2002 Q3 (see Table 1.B).  Its major counterpart, M4 lending (excluding the effects of securitisations), which measures sterling lending by UK banks and building societies to those same three sectors, rose by 9.6% during the same period.  The growth rates of these two aggregates have been declining for the past two years or so.  However, much of the decline can be accounted for by the OFCs sector.  Changes in OFCs’ money and credit are thought to have fewer direct implications for nominal demand than those of households and non-financial corporations.  Excluding the OFCs component, growth in M4 and M4 lending has been steadier in the recent past (see Chart 1.1 1).

Money and asset prices 9 Developments in the velocity of narrow money  During the past two years, the annual rate of growth of M0 has averaged 8.0%.  By contrast, the annual rate of growth of nominal consumption has averaged just 5.0%.  Should policy-makers be concerned by this rapid growth in the quantity of narrow money?  Does it signal that inflation will soon pick up, or perhaps that consumption is being underrecorded?  Not necessarily—the relationship between economic activity and M0 is complicated by changes in interest rates and the associated process of financial innovation. Chart A compares the velocity of circulation of narrow money, defined here as the ratio of nominal consumption per annum to M0, with a nominal interest rate.  The nominal interest rate is a measure of the opportunity cost of holding cash.  It measures the cost of the interest foregone (represented here by the return on eligible bills) when an individual chooses to hold cash in preference to other forms of wealth.  When the opportunity cost of holding cash is high, then other things equal, narrow money holdings should be low relative to consumption—in other words velocity should be high. For most of the period since 1 870 the two series have moved together.  During the early part of the 1 970s, the nominal interest rate began to rise sharply, reaching a peak of 17 .4% in 1 980 Q1.  This unprecedented increase in the opportunity cost of holding narrow money may have contributed to the development of cash-saving innovations, such as the introduction of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), encouraged payment of salaries by cheque, or by direct money transfer, and promoted the introduction of credit and debit cards.  These innovations were associated with a significant upward shift in velocity. But since the early 1 990s, interest rates have fallen precipitously.  Chart A suggests the puzzle is not the current strength of M0 growth, but rather its weakness.  Why has M0 not grown more quickly to bring velocity back into line with the low levels seen before the high inflation/high nominal interest rate era of the 1 970s and 1 980s?  Part of the explanation is perhaps that people have grown accustomed to holding less cash, and that the technology enabling them to do this, while expensive to set up, is relatively cheap to maintain. It can be instructive to look at narrow money velocity trends in other countries.  Nominal interest rates also rose sharply during the early part of the 1 970s in the United States and Canada, but these countries did not experience, to the same degree, a second period of high nominal interest rates at the end of the 1 980s.  In the United States, narrow money velocity has now returned to pre-1 970s’ levels (see Chart B). However, this series may have been distorted by the increasing use of dollar bills outside the United States.  In Canada, narrow money velocity began to decline around ten years after the peak in nominal interest rates.  Although it has not yet returned to pre-1 970s’ levels, it has fallen further than in the United Kingdom (see Chart C).  Given the current low rates of interest, and the experience of other low nominal interest rate economies, it seems plausible that M0 could continue to grow in excess of nominal consumption for some time to come, without necessarily jeopardising the inflation target.

(a) Average duration is calculated as the outstanding stock of credit  card debt divided by the monthly flow of repayments.  The series is  presented as a three-month moving average. Households Households’ M4 deposit growth has remained firm.  Annual growth in Q3, at 8.1%, was close to rates seen for the past year or so.  Growth in lending to individuals continued to strengthen.  Total lending to individuals, which measures lending by a broader set of institutions than just banks and building societies, rose by 1 3.1% in the year to Q3, the fastest rate of growth since 1 990.  Lending secured on dwellings grew by 12.4% while the remainder, which includes credit card and store card lending, as well as personal loans and overdrafts, grew by 1 5.8%. House price rises boost secured lending through two separate channels.  First, for a given loan-to-value ratio, first-time buyers will require larger mortgages than before.  Second, existing homeowners will see an improvement in their net housing wealth, giving them the scope to undertake further secured borrowing at lower rates than on unsecured debt.  Of the £1 8.6 billion net secured borrowing by individuals in Q2, it is estimated that £10.6 billion, or more than half, was not invested in the housing stock.  It is likely that some of this £10.6 billion, known as mortgage equity withdrawal (MEW), was used to purchase financial assets, and some used to repay existing unsecured debt.  But a further portion will have been used to fund additional consumption.  Chart 1.12 shows how, in recent years, the fraction of net housing wealth that is withdrawn each quarter, has varied closely with the quantity of net housing wealth.  A box on pages 12–1 3 of this Report examines the relationship between changes in house prices and consumption in different countries. Credit cards have become an increasingly popular source of finance.  Their share in the flow of total unsecured lending to individuals rose from around 30% in the mid-1 990s to around 40% so far this year.  It is sometimes argued that the rapid growth in credit card debt reflects their greater acceptance as a means of payment.  But this seems to be only part of the story.  Since the mid-1 990s, the average time taken to repay credit card debt has increased from a little over three months to nearly five months (see Chart 1.1 3).  People have come to rely increasingly on credit cards as a means to borrow money for a period of time, and not just as a convenient alternative to using cash or a cheque.  This may be because, over the past few years, the effective interest rate on credit card debt has fallen by more than the equivalent rate on personal loans or overdrafts (see Table 1.C). The ratio of household sector liabilities to annualised household sector income reached a new record high in  2002 Q2 (see top panel of Chart 1.1 4).  But household sector liabilities are dwarfed by household sector assets.

Money and asset prices 11 housing is excluded, and even after sharp falls in equity prices, household sector financial assets are still worth more than three times as much as household sector liabilities (see bottom panel of Chart 1.1 4). Of course, the fact that the household sector has far more assets than liabilities is not necessarily cause for comfort. First, the capital value of the majority of household assets, such as equity and housing, is uncertain.  The sums of money owed to banks, building societies and other lenders vary by comparatively little from quarter to quarter.  This is evident from the chart.  Second, when thinking about the risks to consumption from an excessive build-up of household debt, the distribution and type of assets and liabilities held by individual households matters, as well as the financial balance sheet of the sector as a whole. The British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), conducted in 2000, records the responses of more than 5,000 households to questions about the nature of their assets and liabilities. The survey showed that people with significant liabilities also tended to own valuable assets.  The correlation between the total liabilities and the total assets of individual households was 0.39.  This positive correlation is not surprising—people with large mortgages also tend to own expensive houses.  But housing and similarly illiquid assets may be difficult to realise at short notice.  In evaluating the potential vulnerability of households, it may make better sense to compare total liabilities with liquid assets. Chart 1.1 5 shows the distribution of total liabilities and liquid assets across a randomly chosen 10% sample of the BHPS for the year 2000.(1) A large number of respondents were positioned on at least one of the axes:  40% had no liabilities and 33% no liquid assets.  The correlation between the liabilities and the liquid assets of individual households was just 0.01.  In the event that house prices were to fall, or unemployment were to rise, then the observed distribution of total liabilities and liquid assets across households might indicate that the financial position of the household sector would be less resilient than suggested by the aggregate balance sheet data. Private non-financial corporations The rate of growth of PNFCs’ M4 deposits picked up from 4.4% in the year to Q2 to 6.1% in the year to Q3.

Inflation Report: November 2002 12 International housing-market developments Movements in equity markets and housing markets reflect underlying shocks to the economy, and are themselves important influences on economic activity and thus inflation.  The sharp gains and subsequent falls in real equity prices(1) over the past few years have been highly synchronised across most industrialised countries (see Chart A).  In contrast, movements in real house prices have been less uniform across countries (see Chart B), so they may have supported activity in some countries and weakened it in others. Looking across countries, changes in house prices are typically associated with changes in household consumption (see Chart C).  Consumer confidence and income expectations will determine households’ desired consumption of both housing and other goods and services.  To the extent that the supply of housing is not perfectly elastic in the short run, higher housing demand will be translated into higher prices.  So consumption and house prices can be correlated because they share a common cause. A rise in house prices may also stimulate an increase in consumption.  Owner-occupiers both own and consume the housing services provided by their dwellings, so a change in the price of a claim to this flow (ie a change in house prices) will not have the same effect as a change in the value of other wealth, such as shares.  But an increase in house prices may facilitate cheaper borrowing, as housing wealth may be offered as collateral for loans.  This will make it easier for households to bring forward consumption of future income, and also to smooth consumption against temporary shocks to income flows.  So higher house prices may encourage higher consumption in the short run as well.   The strength of this ‘collateral effect’ will depend on how easy it is to extract housing equity for consumption (mortgage equity withdrawal).  This has changed over time, varies widely across countries, and depends on the institutional and regulatory characteristics of mortgage finance institutions.  In countries such as the United Kingdom where it is relatively cheap and easy to extract housing equity, rising house prices may be providing support for consumption, and thus mitigating the negative effects of the recent stock market falls.

In some areas, an increase in the demand for housing, due to an increase in incomes, population or credit availability, will lead to the construction of new houses.  In other areas, where either land availability or planning constraints inhibit increased supply,the price of houses must rise to bring demand back in line with the fixed supply. Evidence from the United States(2) suggests that the price of housing is close to marginal costs of construction in most areas, with land constituting a small share of total costs.  Where land availability or planning restrictions prevent additional supply of similar dwellings, house prices are far above physical replacement cost. To the extent that the supply of land with planning approval, relative to the demand for it, varies across countries, the long-run response of national average house prices to an increase in housing demand will differ.  In countries and regions where land availability and planning regulations facilitate new construction, real house prices will rise in line with construction costs in the long run.  Where new construction is in some manner constrained, real house prices may rise faster, as rising real incomes bid up the price of the scarce factor (land with planning permission).  Long-term trends in house prices indeed vary widely across countries (see Charts D and E) as well as across regions, although problems of quality adjustment make international comparisons only tentative, and the low frequency of the cycles make it difficult to assess the trend.

Nevertheless, it remains at a historically high level.  Capital gearing at market value rose sharply in Q2, reflecting the fall in equity markets (see Chart 1.1 6).

US GDP grew by 0.3% in Q2, compared with 1.2% in Q1.   The advance estimate for Q3 was 0.8%.  Growth in the euro area in Q2 was 0.4%, unchanged from Q1.  Japanese GDP  rose by 0.6% in Q2, following a revised figure of no growth in Q1. Euro area Growth in the euro area reached a trough in 2001 Q4, but the subsequent pick-up has been modest, reflecting prolonged weakness in consumption and investment (see Table 2.B).  The falls in equity prices since 2000 have dampened consumption growth in the major economies.  But consumer spending in the euro area has weakened more sharply than in the United Kingdom and the United States (see Chart 2.1).  And it seems unlikely that the predominant cause of weak euro-area consumption has been the decline in equity wealth. Households’ direct share ownership remains less widespread and the ratio of equity market capitalisation to GDP is lower than in the United Kingdom and the United States.(1) So although equity prices fell further in the euro area, they probably had a smaller impact on consumption.  Moreover, these equity price falls cannot have been the initial cause of the consumption slowdown, as that started in early 1 999, when stock prices were still rising rapidly.  By contrast, the start of Economic growth in the major overseas economies slowed in the second quarter, in line with the MPC’s assessment in the August Report.  Net trade made a large positive contribution to UK GDP growth in Q2, compared with a mostly negative contribution during the past six years.  Private investment has remained weak, with little sign of an imminent turnaround.  Consumer spending was strong in the second quarter and confidence remains high.  However, recent UK data have been affected by the timing of Easter and the Jubilee Bank Holidays, which have obscured the underlying trends.  The unravelling of these effects is likely to depress consumption growth temporarily in Q3.  But relatively robust consumption growth is expected in the following six months.

Inflation Report: November 2002 16 the US and UK consumption slowdown coincided more closely with the peaks in their respective equity markets. Which other factors could account for the weakness of consumption in the euro area?  In answering this question it may help to focus on recent developments in Germany. Although consumption growth has slowed in the main  euro-area economies, it has been particularly weak in Germany, where the level of consumer spending actually contracted between 2001 Q3 and 2002 Q1.   Households are typically assumed to consider consumption and saving decisions in the light of expectations of income over the longer term (or ‘permanent’ income), rather than simply their income in the current period, which may be prone to short-term fluctuations.  Nevertheless, consumption might still move in line with current income if this was thought to contain news about future income, or if households were unable to borrow or liquidate assets to fund consumption when income was temporarily low.   German consumer spending appears to follow real household disposable income more closely than in other countries (see Chart 2.2).  So the weakness in German household income (which has, on average, grown in real terms by less than half that in France and the United States since 1 999) has probably been a key factor behind the consumption downturn there. Energy and food price increases, as well as the depreciation of the euro against other major currencies, may have depressed German real incomes in 2000 and 2001.  In 2002, the continued rise in unemployment may have further weakened them.  And perceptions of price increases resulting from the changeover to euro notes and coins in January may have encouraged households to believe that their real incomes had fallen by more than they actually have (see Chart 2.3), possibly also putting some downward pressure on their spending. Not all consumption in Germany has been financed out of current income.  When bank lending to households grew quickly in Germany during 1 999, consumption growth peaked and exceeded income growth.  But households’ bank borrowing has slowed in Germany since end-1 999 (and also, although less so, in the whole euro area), whereas it remained robust in the United States and rose vigorously in the United Kingdom (see Chart 2.4).  Some of the slowdown in German households’ bank borrowing may have reflected a downward adjustment of their long-term income prospects.  Falling house prices may also have been a cause of the weak borrowing. House prices in Germany have fallen in real and nominal terms over the past decade, in contrast to the rises in the Chart 2.2 Consumption and real household  disposable income 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 1991 93 95 97 99 2001 Percentage changes on a quarter earlier Consumption Real disposable income + _ Germany Source:  Thomson Financial Datastream. 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 1991 93 95 97 99 2001 United States Percentage changes on a quarter earlier Consumption Real disposable income + _ 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 1991 93 95 97 99 2001 France Percentage changes on a quarter earlier Real disposable income Consumption + _ Chart 2.3 Actual and perceived inflation in Germany 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 1991 93 95 97 99 2001 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Balance Percentage change on a year earlier Perceived (b) Actual (a) _ + + _ (left-hand scale) (right-hand scale) Sources:  European Commission and Thomson Financial Datastream.

To some extent, the decline in German house prices may have been related to excess supply, resulting from subsidies for construction investment in the early 1 990s.  Borrowing secured against the value of their home enables households to raise finance more cheaply than at unsecured rates.  So part of the fall in credit and hence consumption growth in Germany may be explained by weakness in the housing market reducing the value of households’ collateral.   Euro-area retail sales increased by 0.4% in the three months to August compared with the previous three months, suggesting somewhat faster consumption growth in Q3.  But, looking further ahead, consumer confidence data for October suggested that consumers have become more pessimistic about the outlook for the economy as a whole and their own financial situation during the next twelve months. Investment in the euro area continued to fall in Q2 and was 2.7% lower than a year earlier.  This was mainly accounted for by a 6.4% annual fall in German investment (see Chart 2.5). German investment has been falling since 2000 Q4, largely as a result of a decline in construction investment (which represents around 50% of the total) following the  post-reunification boom.  But reconstruction work following the floods in August may provide some temporary stimulus to investment in the near future. Partly reflecting flood-related disruptions, the recovery in euro-area industrial production remained weak in Q3. Although production was higher than its November 2001 trough, it was still down on levels of a year ago.  Industrial activity in the euro area, as measured by the Reuters manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (a weighted average of the survey balances for new orders, output, employment, suppliers’ delivery times and the stock of items purchased), rose to 49.1 in October, still below the 50 ‘no change’ level.   The Committee continues to expect a small pick-up in  euro-area GDP growth early next year.  But the recovery is likely to be slightly more subdued than was expected at the time of the August Report. United States US GDP increased by 0.3% in Q2, compared with unusually fast growth of 1.2% in Q1, which was partly due to a large contribution from inventories (see Table 2.C).

Inflation Report: November 2002 18 The advance estimate showed that growth picked up to 0.8% in the third quarter, reflecting a rise in consumption growth. The latter was largely accounted for by strong new auto  sales in July and August.  The widespread availability of  zero-per cent finance deals on new auto purchases reduced the average interest rate on auto loans (see Chart 2.6) and may, in part, have brought forward future spending on autos. But data for September suggest a fall-back in new auto sales as incentives have been withdrawn.  The strength of the US housing market has helped to underpin consumer spending by encouraging increased mortgage refinancing.  But refinancing has begun to fall back recently.  And consumers appear to have become more gloomy about the future.  Consumer confidence fell sharply on both the University of Michigan and Conference Board measures in October.   The preliminary estimate suggested that US fixed investment rose by 0.1% in Q3, following seven consecutive quarters of decline.  But spare capacity, high corporate debt levels, weakening credit flows, credit-rating downgrades, wider credit spreads and lower equity prices suggest that recovery will be sluggish. US industrial production fell in August and September, following seven months of growth.  But the longer-term profile continued to show a gradual recovery.  In its central projection, the Committee expects US GDP growth to ease back in the fourth quarter, with a slowdown in consumer spending.  Thereafter, growth should strengthen gradually, underpinned by continued improvements in productivity and the low level of interest rates. Asia Japanese GDP grew by 0.6% in Q2.  GDP growth in Q1 was revised to 0.0%, from 1.4% in the original release, reflecting the adoption by the Japanese authorities in August of a new method for calculating GDP .  The recovery in Japan in  2002 Q2 was largely driven by a strong contribution from net trade, and in particular a sharp rise in exports to other  Asian economies.  Investment was the only component to  make a negative contribution to GDP growth.  In recent months, industrial production growth has picked up significantly, though output fell in September.  But despite these signs of recovery, there is little change to the Committee’s view that the prospects for Japan remain weak in the near term. GDP in other Asian countries continued to grow rapidly in the second quarter, reflecting the strength of domestic demand.

The region accounts for around 6% of UK exports, and for around 17% of international trade (see Table 2.D).  So the strength of demand in the region may stimulate world activity and UK growth. Net trade Economic activity overseas affects UK growth via its contribution to net trade.  In Q2, UK export volumes rose at a faster rate than import volumes, although both may have been affected by the Jubilee Bank Holidays.  The net trade contribution to GDP growth rose to 0.9 percentage points, compared with a negative contribution of 0.6 percentage points in Q1.  But the Q2 fall in the terms of trade (the ratio of export to import prices) led to a slight increase in the current account deficit to 1.6% of GDP .  The current account has been in deficit for most of the period since 1 986 (see Chart 2.7). Developments in trade volumes and prices in Q2 were unusual relative to trends over recent years.  During the past six years, import growth has outstripped that of exports almost continuously, so net trade has detracted from UK growth.  But the impact on the current account has been mitigated by a steady improvement in the terms of trade (see Chart 2.8).   In the three months to August, goods export volumes fell by more than goods import volumes, compared with the previous three months, suggesting that net trade will make a negative contribution to Q3 GDP growth.  Survey measures of export orders weakened in Q3 (see Table 2.E). 2.2 Domestic demand Growth of real final domestic demand in the United Kingdom slowed to 0.3% in 2002 Q2 (see Table 2.F).  Consumer spending grew strongly after a subdued first quarter, but government consumption fell back sharply following a very marked increase in Q1.  Quarterly growth of domestic demand in the second quarter was the weakest since 1 995, in part because of a significant negative contribution from inventories.  However, recent data may not be a good guide to underlying trends because of the impact of the timing of Easter and the two Jubilee Bank Holidays.   Consumption Consumer spending rebounded in 2002 Q2, to grow at its fastest quarterly rate since early 2000 (see Chart 2.9), following a muted first quarter which saw the slowest growth since 1 997 .  Nevertheless, the four-quarter growth rate has been consistently above 3% since 1 995.

A reading above 50 suggests expansion;  below 50 suggests contraction.  Inflation Report: November 2002 20 below, the effects of the timing of Easter and the Jubilee Bank Holidays mean that quarterly consumption growth is expected to fall back sharply in Q3.  If it does so, the average growth rate over the first three quarters of 2002 might be somewhat lower than for any comparable period over the previous few years, though still above the long-run trend rate. Recent Reports have highlighted the extent to which durable goods, and especially vehicles, have underpinned the strength of consumption.  But the latest data contain indications that spending on durables may be weakening.(1) The contribution to consumption growth in 2002 Q2 from durable goods other than vehicles was the lowest for nearly five years.  A substantial factor in this weak performance was a 9.5% fall in purchases of major household appliances—the weakest quarterly growth in this component for nearly ten years.  However, this fall in spending on major household goods sits uneasily with the present strength of the housing market, as the two markets are generally assumed to be complementary.  Vehicle purchases rebounded strongly in the second quarter, and accounted for around half of the increase in quarterly consumption growth (see Chart 2.10).  But there are signs of a sharp slowing in the third quarter.  Private vehicle registrations in Q3 were 2% lower than a year earlier, down from 10.4% growth in the year to Q2. The ONS monthly retail sales index covers around 35% of household consumption—the latter also includes vehicles, energy and consumer services.  The most recent retail sales data, up to September, have shown some slowing in growth (see Chart 2.1 1), with quarterly growth of 0.7% in Q3—the lowest since 2000 Q2.   However, retail sales data and consumer spending this year have been affected by the timing of Easter as well as the two Jubilee Bank Holidays.  A box in the May Report highlighted how seasonal patterns and other factors can affect economic data.  A particular challenge this year was presented by the timing of the Easter holiday period, straddling the first and second quarters rather than the more usual timing of being exclusively in April.  Although the ONS attempted to take account of this timing change, it would appear that the seasonal adjustment this year may still have given too much of a boost to sales in April, and perhaps too little in March.  On seasonally adjusted data, retail sales this year rose by 0.1% in March and 1.7% in April.   Although the retail sales data were adjusted for the Bank Holiday falling in June rather than May, the ONS did not Table 2.F Expenditure components of demand(a) Percentage changes on a quarter earlier Average Average 2001 2002 2000 2001 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Consumption: Household 1.2 1.0 1.0 1.1 0.5 1.3 Government 0.3 1.3 2.7 1.8 2.9 -2.7 Investment: 1.1 -1.7 -0.7 -3.3 -1.5 -0.6 of which, business  investment 1.4 -2.2 -1.0 -4.5 -5.4 -0.2 Final domestic demand 1.0 0.6 1.0 0.5 0.6 0.3 Change in inventories (b) -0.2 -0.1 -0.5 0.3 0.1 -0.6 Excluding alignment  adjustment (b) -0.2 -0.2 -0.1 -0.5 0.7 -0.4 Domestic demand 0.8 0.6 0.5 0.8 0.7 -0.3 Exports 2.1 -1.3 -3.2 -1.6 -0.1 3.5 Imports 2.6 -0.6 -2.3 0.3 1.4 0.6 Net trade (b) -0.3 -0.2 -0.2 -0.6 -0.6 0.9 GDP at market prices 0.6 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.6 (a) At constant 1 995 market prices.

Demand 21 adjust the retail sales data for the additional Bank Holiday in June, as this was a one-off event.  It seems likely that the level of sales in June was reduced because some shops closed for an extra day.  Nevertheless Chart 2.1 1 suggests that the positive effect in April may have outweighed the negative effect in June, leaving an overall positive impact on the level of sales in the second quarter.   Table 2.G summarises the potential overall direction of these timing effects on the quarterly levels and growth rates of retail sales.  In particular, the timing of Easter may have boosted quarter-on-quarter growth in the second quarter because of both lower sales in the first quarter and higher sales in the second.  The level of sales in the third quarter should be largely unaffected, but the quarterly growth rate would be reduced because of the exceptionally higher level of sales in Q2. Such timing effects increase the difficulty of judging the underlying trend in retail sales.  Although recent three-month growth rates have been low, Chart 2.12 appears consistent with a broadly constant underlying trend in retail sales growth during the past year.  The value of household assets can have an important influence on consumption.  Section 1 explains that recent house price inflation has been higher than projected in the August Report. That is helping to support strong borrowing and consumption growth through mortgage equity withdrawal.  Equity prices fell sharply during late summer, but have since recovered much of that lost ground.  As yet, however, there has been little apparent effect of equity market weakness on consumption or consumer confidence.  The GfK consumer confidence survey has not picked up any large effect on consumer sentiment from equity prices.  Households remain optimistic about their own financial position over the next twelve months (see Chart 2.1 3), with the September survey recording the highest ever balance and only a small decrease in October.  The reading for the general economic situation has been close to its long-term average since the start of the year. As discussed above, households are likely to look beyond income in the current period when making spending decisions.  But Chart 2.1 4 shows that consumption growth has been correlated with income growth, although the relationship has been less strong since 1 990.(1) This may be because progressive financial innovation and deregulation have made it easier for households to borrow in order to smooth their consumption.

Inflation Report: November 2002 22 Household real post-tax income growth slowed during the first half of 2002 (see Chart 2.1 5).  This was mainly due to more volatile components, including a significant reduction in net property income in Q2.  As such, consumers may have viewed it as a temporary change more than a reduction in their permanent income, particularly given the climate of greater macroeconomic stability since the early 1 990s.  However, some of the reduction in net property income reflected lower dividend receipts—which consumers could potentially regard as a more persistent change if it were accompanied by reduced expectations of future earnings from equity holdings.  Looking ahead, the Committee expects a sharp, but temporary, slowdown in consumption growth in the third quarter, reflecting a likely fall in spending on vehicles and the timing effects discussed above.  But relatively robust growth is expected in the following six months, followed by a moderation through next year to a little below long-run trend rates. Public sector spending For some while, general government spending has been rising strongly, although there have been volatile movements from quarter to quarter.  Government consumption rose by 2.9% in 2002 Q1 and then fell by 2.7% in Q2—the largest quarterly increase since 1 97 5 followed by the largest quarterly fall since 1 985.  Despite the fall in 2002 Q2, the level of government consumption was 4.6% higher than a year earlier. Government investment was even more volatile, but followed the same pattern of a very strong first quarter and a fall-back in the second quarter.  Nevertheless, the level in 2002 Q2 was 1 1.6% higher than a year earlier.  Government spending data for the second quarter may have also been affected by the Jubilee Bank Holidays, for instance reflecting some public services being closed for an extra day in June.  So there might be some bounceback in the third quarter.  The MPC’s projections are based on the Government’s nominal spending plans, which imply continued robust growth in government spending over the forecast period. Investment Business investment is estimated to have edged down slightly in 2002 Q2, following sharp falls in the preceding two quarters.  These were the most severe falls in business investment for nearly ten years, and the Q2 level was almost 1 1% lower than a year earlier.  Moreover, Chart 2.1 6 shows that such a large year-on-year decrease in business investment is unusual at a time when GDP growth has remained positive. The recent fall in business investment is on a comparable scale Chart 2.14 Consumption and income growth 1964–2001 4 2 2 4 6 8 10 4 2 2 4 6 8 10 1964–89 1990–2001 Consumption growth, per cent Real post-tax income growth, per cent + – Chart 2.15 Contributions to real household post-tax  income growth(a) 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 2000 01 02 Contribution to quarterly growth, percentage points + – Other Prices Wages and salaries Net property income Taxes and social contributions Total (a) Deflated by the household consumption deflator.

The previous episode when business investment dropped sharply while GDP growth remained positive was in the mid-1 980s, and was a special case reflecting the effects of phased abolition of tax allowances for investment.  Revisions to the data since the August Report have  changed the profile of business investment through 2001. Chart 2.17 compares the quarterly growth rates of business investment in the latest data with those available at the time of the previous two Reports.  Although the total fall in investment is similar to that in the August Report, the quarterly profile has changed so that the decline is now estimated to have been concentrated in 2001 Q4 and 2002 Q1.  The latest data are much more consistent than the August vintage with investment plans having been put on hold because of increased uncertainty in the aftermath of the September 2001 terrorist attacks. Investment by the service sector is around 70% of business investment, so it is not surprising that it has accounted for a large proportion of the recent swings in business investment (see Chart 2.1 8).  In 2000, around one third of service sector investment was in ICT assets.  Although later data for the composition of service sector investment are not available, it seems plausible that reduced spending on ICT would have played a substantial part in the overall decline in investment, especially given the recent downturn in ICT output and imports.  Output of the electrical and optical engineering sector fell by 1 8.8% in the year to 2002 Q2, while ICT imports fell by 1 1.2%. Looking ahead, there is little sign of a turnaround in investment in the near term.  High capital gearing may impede future borrowing, and pension fund shortfalls could reduce the internal funds available for investment.  Capacity utilisation is currently close to, or possibly below, normal levels (see Section 3).  And uncertainty about the global recovery persists.  Table 2.H shows that in 2002 Q3 most survey measures of investment intentions fell to levels below the series averages.  The Committee expects business investment to dip a little further in the second half of 2002, and then to pick up gradually thereafter. Inventories  Inventories (excluding the statistical alignment adjustment) made a negative contribution to growth in four of the past  five quarters, largely driven by lower manufacturing stocks.   In 2002, the switch from first-quarter stockbuilding to  second-quarter destocking reduced Q2 GDP growth by  Chart 2.17 Business investment 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Percentage changes on a quarter earlier 2000 01 02 + _ Current August Inflation Report May Inflation Report Table 2.H Investment intentions(a) Series  2001 2002 average (b) Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 CBI Quarterly Industrial  Trends (c) Plant and machinery 0 -28 -28 -25 -1 3 -25 Buildings -17 -29 -29 -30 -1 8 -27 BCC manufacturing Plant and machinery 10 0 -5 -3 7 10 CBI/Grant Thornton  service sector survey (d) Vehicles, plant and  machinery -7 -2 1 -29 -1 5 -9 -26 Land and buildings -7 -25 -1 8 -22 -1 4 -20 Information technology 20 2 -17 4 20 -6 BCC services Plant and machinery 1 5 1 1 8 1 5 1 6 1 3 Sources:  BCC, CBI and Grant Thornton.

The choice of weights for those components affects how aggregate measures behave.  The weights are currently constructed according to the share in total output or expenditure of each component in a ‘base year’ , most recently 1 995.    There has been a five-yearly interval between base years.  At the most recent rebasing, in 1 998, the data were rebased to 1 995 prices, from 1 990 prices. Rebasing does not mean that all years of a series are recalculated using weights from the new base year. Instead, a ‘link year’ is chosen between the old and the new estimates.  The link year between 1 990 and 1 995 prices is 1 994.  The new weights are only  applied to a series from the link year onwards.   Before that, data are simply rescaled to the new  price basis. Demand is likely to grow more rapidly for goods and services whose relative prices are falling.  Hence rapidly growing sectors tend to be those with falling relative prices.  So for years after the base year, estimated real GDP growth would tend to be higher using base year weights, which are larger for the rapidly-growing sectors, than it would be using weights based on shares of current nominal GDP . Conversely, growth might be weaker in the years before the base year but after the link year.   With periodic rebasing of the National Accounts, a highly stylised version of such a pattern is shown in Chart A, on the purely illustrative assumption that the real growth rate abstracting from the effects of using base year weights would be constant.  With five-yearly rebasing, most years will be no more than two or three years away from a base year. However, as is common in the run-up to rebasing, the present year is seven years away from the base year. The potential distortion from base-weighting gets larger, the further away from the base year (see  Chart B).  In practice, however, prices and volumes move in ways that can upset the stylised assumptions above. Growth is not constant over time.  And there are many instances where the relative price of a component falls but volume growth is low, for example when  tastes change and relative demand for a product declines.  Indeed, a previous rebasing showed that growth was lower at 1 990 prices than at 1 985 prices, because of falls in oil prices and production between the two base years.  So actual GDP growth does not always follow the general pattern shown in Charts A and B.   When GDP was rebased to 1 995 prices, a number of other methodological changes were introduced, including moving to the European System of Accounts (ESA95).(1) Table 1 summarises the reasons for revisions to GDP growth in the 1 998 Blue Book.   The effect of rebasing was to reduce estimated growth, and in this case by an increasing amount  over time. Within domestic demand, the main changes in relative prices since 1 995 have been a strong general government consumption price deflator and a weak investment price deflator (see Table 2).  Using 1 995 rather than current prices would give a higher estimate of growth in 1 998, when investment was rising rapidly, because investment had a higher weight at 1 995 prices than it would have at current prices. Chart B Stylised impact of rebasing Base Base Base Constant growth Growth rate Old price basis New price basis Chart A Stylised impact of changing base years Base Base Base Base Base Constant  growth Growth rate (1) The effects of changing the base year and other revisions to the National Accounts were described on pages 1 4–1 5 of the November 1 998 Inflation Report.    Demand 25 The effect can go the other way too.  Government consumption has grown strongly recently, but its relative price has risen since 1 995.  And investment has fallen in the past six quarters despite a declining relative price.  Recent demand growth may therefore be higher at current prices than it is at 1 995 prices. This is because using current prices would give greater weight to strong government consumption, and less weight to weak investment, than using 1 995 prices. Similar considerations apply to movements within these broad components of demand.  For instance, the price of durable consumption goods has fallen relative to that of non-durable goods.  And the past few years have seen strong growth in spending on durable goods.  So real consumption growth measured using 1 995 prices is likely to be higher than it would be if measured using more up-to-date prices, which would give lower weight to the rapidly growing durables component.   If the effect of using 1 995 prices is to increase measured real consumption growth, then it also reduces the rate of increase in the consumption price deflator, which is the difference between observed nominal spending and estimated real spending.  The consumption deflator has indeed risen slowly over the past few years, when compared with other indicators of consumer price inflation, such as RPIX which is annually chain-linked. The MPC’s judgment is that the effect of weighting using base year relative prices is purely a measurement issue.  It affects estimates of both aggregate demand and potential supply, and therefore has no implications for the assessment of capacity pressures and inflation.  But, as noted in the August Report, it will need to be taken into account when comparing current forecasts, based on 1 995 prices, against subsequent published outturns on a different price basis. On the usual timetable, data for recent years would be rebased onto 2000 prices in the 2003 Blue Book. However, next year the ONS plans to introduce annually chain-linked measures to the UK National Accounts.  This will provide a more timely and accurate basis for comparisons and avoid measurement issues from base-year effects in the future.  It means that the price base will be updated each year, rather than every five years.  The ONS has suggested that the introduction of annual  chain-linking may cause estimates of real GDP growth in recent years to be revised slightly downwards.(2) This is consistent with the effects of rebasing suggested in the discussion above.

Chart 2.1 9 shows that although there was a build-up of retail stocks, manufacturing stocks fell sharply—the largest quarterly fall since 1 997 .  It is likely that there was a Jubilee effect, to the extent that manufacturers’ stocks may have been run down to compensate for lost production in June.  Despite the reductions in manufacturers’ inventories in recent quarters, the stock-output ratio has continued an increase that began in 1 999 (see Chart 2.20).  The ratio in 2002 Q1 was the highest for almost ten years.  It had been quite steady since the mid-1 990s, following a sharp fall from the early 1 980s.  If the recent rise were unintended, then it might point to further falls in manufacturing stocks in the quarters ahead.

Inflation Report: November 2002 26 the balance of firms with more than adequate stocks of finished goods was close to its long-run average (see  Chart 2.2 1).   The Committee assumes that the UK stock cycle is close to the end of the destocking phase, which would provide a one-off boost to GDP growth.  After that, inventory levels are assumed to move broadly in line with output.

(a) Balance of firms saying that present stocks of finished goods  are more than adequate against those saying stocks are less  than adequate.  27 Output and supply 3 3.1 Output The supply capacity of the economy depends on the  available factors of production (such as land, labour and capital equipment);  the work effort of labour and capital;  and the efficiency with which all the factors are used.   But the extent to which the growth of potential supply can vary, in part, depends on the horizon.  In the very short run, the number of people a business employs, the amount of physical capital it owns, and those factors’ efficiency of use  are relatively fixed.  So the business’s short-run supply decision is how much to produce given its existing  workforce and capital stock, in the light of its expectations  for demand and the price of its output.  The outcome of  these short-run supply decisions is reflected in GDP , which  is a measure of the output produced in any period.  In the medium term, businesses have more flexibility with respect  to the production process.  For example they can decide  how many people they employ and for how long and this will, in total, depend partly on the availability of labour, including the unemployed, and the number of hours people are prepared to work.  In the longer run, the economy’s  potential to grow will depend on population growth;  the profitability of capital investment;  and the extent to which innovations and ideas improve the economy’s ability to  turn labour effort into the goods and services that people demand.     Quarterly GDP growth slowed to 0.1% in 2002 Q1, but  has since picked up.  Nonetheless, GDP growth in 2002 Q2 and Q3, taken together, was lower than the Committee believed at the time of the August Report.  GDP is now estimated by the ONS to have increased by just 0.6% in  GDP growth in 2002 Q2 and Q3 taken together was a little weaker than expected by the MPC at the time of the August Report.  Capacity utilisation appears to be slightly below normal levels across the economy as a whole.  Aggregate rates of employment and unemployment have barely changed.  The  2001 Census has led the ONS to revise its estimates of the UK working-age population, but that has not affected the MPC’s judgment about growth in the near-term potential supply capacity of the economy. The Committee expects annual GDP growth to continue to pick up in the next six months.   Inflation Report: November 2002 28 2002 Q2, somewhat lower than the preliminary estimate of 0.9% reported in the August Report.  Services output and industrial production increased by 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively, in Q2.  The Jubilee holidays reduced the number of working days in June in many sectors of the economy.  In June, the ONS’ experimental index of services (IoS) fell by 1.8%, while industrial production fell by 4.3% (see Chart 3.1).  These were the lowest monthly growth rates since figures began in  January 1 995 for the IoS and since January 1 979 for industrial production.  Weighting together the IoS and industrial production (together representing 93% of GDP), overall output fell by 2.4% in June. GDP grew by 0.7% in Q3 according to the preliminary estimate.  Service sector output and industrial production grew by 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively.  Some pick-up in GDP growth might have been expected in Q3, reflecting the effects of the Jubilee holidays on the level of GDP in Q2.  Industrial production did indeed recover in July, it then fell modestly in August and September (see Chart 3.1).  Motor vehicles production was affected in June as holiday plant closures, which usually occurred later in the summer, were brought forward to the Jubilee week.  As a result, output increased strongly in July and August (see Chart 3.2), raising industrial production growth by at least 0.5 percentage points in each month, before falling back in September to around its May level.  Output in most other manufacturing industries was subdued in August and September.  In the electrical and optical goods sector, it fell by 3.9% in August, reducing industrial production growth by about 0.4 percentage points, and was little changed in September. Construction output increased by 7 .0% in the year to Q2, accounting for half of the growth of whole-economy gross value added at basic prices, despite only having a weight of 5.2% in national output.  Construction new orders were strong in Q3 and the future business activity index in the October CIPS construction survey continued to suggest rapid expansion in the sector. Growth in GDP compared with a year earlier reached a  trough of 1.0% in 2002 Q1.  It has since recovered to 1.7%  in Q3.  The Committee expects annual GDP growth to continue to pick up in the next six months. 3.2 Capacity utilisation Potential supply is difficult to estimate.  In part this is because the capital stock and the potential efficiency with which the Chart 3.1 Industrial production and the index of  services  96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 Jan. 2002 Feb. Mar. Apr.

Estimates of capacity utilisation provide an indication of whether businesses are operating above or below normal levels of supply capacity, given their existing amounts of factor inputs.  So they are potentially useful in assessing the balance between demand and supply in the economy in the short run, and hence the degree of inflationary pressure. When demand is weaker than businesses expect, initially that surprise may be reflected in some industries by a build-up in inventories.  But, thereafter, businesses may decide to lower output by reducing capacity utilisation—that is, the intensity they work their employees and capital equipment—for example by slowing the production line.  And businesses might also reduce the hours of their employees, for example by reducing overtime.  Hiring and firing costs inhibit frequent changes in employment levels.  Hence, businesses tend to hoard labour during slowdowns and only reduce employment if they revise down their expectations of demand in the medium term.  Resale values of capital equipment are often so low as to discourage premature disposal by businesses.  So it may not be worth their while to reduce the amount of capital significantly and quickly in the face of demand weakness. The CBI and British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) surveys include questions on capacity utilisation.  The CBI Industrial Trends survey asks whether businesses are working below a satisfactory full rate of operation, while the BCC survey asks if businesses are operating at full, or below full, capacity.  The CBI survey suggests capacity utilisation in manufacturing is currently well below its average level since 1 972 (see  Chart 3.3).  This is broadly consistent with the latest output figures described above.  In the service sector, the BCC survey was above its historical average in Q3, despite lower output growth in the past year. The BCC ‘manufacturing’ survey covers the rest of the economy—that is, agriculture, energy and construction, as well as manufacturing.  Table 3.A shows the BCC measure of capacity utilisation for these industries in Q3 was slightly above its average since 1 989, in contrast to the CBI survey balance for manufacturing which was well below its average since 1 972.  But recent output trends in construction have been very different to those in manufacturing, so the results from the two surveys are not directly comparable.  Moreover, the capacity utilisation questions in the respective surveys are not identical, and may be interpreted differently by respondents.  The Bank of England’s regional Agents ask businesses about their capacity utilisation.  In manufacturing, the responses are Chart 3.3 Capacity utilisation:  deviations from  average(a) 25 20 1 5 10 5 0 5 10 1 5 20 1 990 92 94 96 98 2000 02 Services (BCC) Percentage points Manufacturing (CBI) (b) _ + Manufacturing (BCC) (c) Sources:  BCC and CBI.

The October Industrial Trends survey, which was conducted between 1 9 September and 9 October, has been allocated to 2002 Q3.  Earlier surveys have been allocated to their respective quarters accordingly.   Inflation Report: November 2002 30 broadly consistent with those from the CBI survey.  Capacity utilisation is reported to be below normal levels, if somewhat higher than at the end of 2001.  In services, capacity is reported to be close to normal levels, a little weaker than that implied by the BCC survey. As much of the short-term variation in the supply of goods and services is likely to reflect changes in hours worked and work effort, the variation in labour productivity per person around its trend may also serve as a useful proxy for capacity utilisation.(1) Labour productivity is currently below its  trend level (see Chart 3.4).  So the labour productivity data, together with the CBI survey and the reports of the Bank of England’s regional Agents, suggest that, on balance, capacity utilisation is currently close to, but possibly a little lower than, normal. 3.3 Labour productivity In the medium term, potential supply will depend on, among other things, the rate of technical progress, the growth of the capital stock and improvements in the skills of the workforce. These will be reflected in the potential growth rate of labour productivity, which measures the volume of output per unit of labour input, expressed either in terms of persons employed or hours worked.   The ONS figures for whole-economy productivity are the  ratio of gross value added at basic prices to the total  number of jobs in the economy.(2) In the Bank of England’s main macroeconomic model, an alternative measure of productivity is used, based on the Labour Force Survey  (LFS) employment figures which are estimated from a survey  of households.  Output per job increased by 0.9% in the  year to 2002 Q2, while this alternative measure of output  per person was little changed in this period (see Chart 3.5). Though short-term weakness is to be expected, given movements in capacity utilisation, output per job has increased at an average annual rate of about 1.4% since  the mid-1 990s, and output per person by 1.2%.  This compares with average productivity growth of just over 2% since 1 960.  Why has productivity growth slowed in recent years? Output will depend in part on the average number of hours worked by each employee.  Average hours have fallen since the (1) See Larsen, J, Neiss, K and Shortall, F (2002), ‘Factor utilisation and productivity estimates for the United Kingdom’ , Bank of England Working Paper no. 162. (2) The ONS figures for jobs in its productivity series include employee jobs from the Workforce Jobs survey, working proprietors, the self-employed,  government-supported trainees and HM Forces.

Based on data unrevised for the effects of the 2001 Census (see the box on page 33).  Output and supply 31 onset of the recent slowdown, but they have also fallen steadily since 1 998.  Falling average hours of full-time employees have probably reflected in part the introduction of the Working Time Directive in October 1 998.(1) The growth of output per hour has thus been somewhat stronger than for output per job and per person (see Chart 3.5).  Whereas output per job has grown at an average annual rate of 1.4% since 1 995, average growth in output per hour has been 1.6% in this period. Labour productivity growth is affected by the rate of growth of capital employed, net of depreciation.  Measuring the capital stock is difficult, in part reflecting the difficulty of measuring scrapping and depreciation.  There are official estimates, but the ONS suspended publication temporarily at the time of the 2002 edition of the Blue Book.  Nevertheless, an indicator of the rate of capital accumulation is given by the ratio of business investment to GDP (measured at 1 995 prices).  This has been historically high since 1 995 (see Chart 3.6).  In part, this has reflected the fall in the price of investment goods relative to the general price level (see Chart 3.7), which has encouraged businesses to use more capital equipment rather than increase employment.  So the fall in labour productivity growth since the mid-1 990s is unlikely to have reflected, even in part, relatively low growth of the capital stock. Part of the fall in measured productivity growth reflects  weak recorded public sector productivity growth since 1 998. As with the rest of the service sector, the public sector is labour intensive and measured productivity growth is relatively low.  For example, productivity growth per job in public administration, education and health (which is mostly in the public sector) has averaged just 0.2% a year from  mid-1 980 to mid-1 998, whereas in the rest of the economy it averaged 2.6% in the same period (see Chart 3.8).  Even so, since 1 998, measured productivity growth in public administration, education and health has averaged -0.4% a year.  The decline in its average annual growth from 0.2% to  -0.4% since 1 998 has reduced annual growth of  whole-economy productivity per job by about 0.2 percentage points in this period.  But public sector output is very difficult to measure, as it is rarely marketed.  For example, estimates of output in the education sector are largely based on the number of pupils, adjusted to allow for their examination results.  Other things equal, a decline in the pupil-teacher ratio designed to improve the quality of education could therefore reduce measured productivity.  These measurement problems make the public sector productivity estimates particularly uncertain.

Inflation Report: November 2002 32 The fall in the unemployment rate since 1 993, currently to its lowest rate for 27 years (measured by the claimant count), may also have depressed productivity growth temporarily.  If, as seems likely, the unemployed have lower skills than the average employee, it may have had some temporary depressing effect on productivity growth.  Any such effect might gradually unwind as new employees benefit from additional work experience. 3.4 Employment Beyond the very short run, one way businesses can increase their collective output is by increasing employment.  The box on page 33 explains how the results from the 2001 Census will affect estimates of employment and other labour market indicators.  The ONS has so far released some provisional estimates only up to August 2001.  So the more recent  labour market data discussed in the following sections  are unaffected by the Census revisions, unless otherwise stated.   Employment measured by the household-based LFS increased by 2 1 1,000 in the period June-August compared with the same period a year earlier.  Almost all of this increase was in  part-time employment.  LFS figures show that the part-time share of employment increased to about 25% in 1 996, when it levelled off (see Chart 3.9).  It has risen again since mid-2001 and is currently at its highest level since the quarterly LFS began in 1 992.  The part-time employees’ share of total hours worked has risen fairly steadily since 1 993 (although there was a temporary decline in the second half of 2001).  This has reflected falling average hours worked by full-time employees and, until the past year, rising average hours worked by  part-time employees. The LFS figures show the number of employees in employment increased by about 1 80,000 in the year to June-August.  But employee jobs measured by the employer-based quarterly Workforce Jobs survey were almost unchanged in the year to 2002 Q2.  The apparent difference between these two trends may be reduced by future upward revisions to the Workforce Jobs estimates.  This has been the pattern of recent years when new information on jobs becomes available from the ONS’ Annual Business Inquiry in December.  Nevertheless, the Workforce Jobs survey is the most  reliable source for the industrial breakdown of  employment.  Public administration, education and  health—which is mostly public sector—accounted for the bulk of the growth of jobs in the service sector in the year  to 2002 Q2.  Jobs in construction increased by 1.8% in the Chart 3.9 Part-time share of employment 23.4 23.8 24.2 24.6 25.0 25.4 25.8 1 993 94 95 96 97 98 99 2000 01 02 10.4 10.8 1 1.2 1 1.6 12.0 12.4 12.8 Per cent of total hours worked Persons (left-hand scale) Hours (right-hand scale) Per cent of total employment 0.0 0.0 Chart 3.10 Workforce Jobs growth by sector 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 Manufacturing Public   administration,   education and   health  Other services Construction Average annual growth since 1 979 Q2 Growth in year to 2002 Q2 Per cent + _ Chart 3.11 Private and public sector employee jobs 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 1 982 84 86 88 90 92 94 96 98 2000 Public sector Private sector Percentage changes on a year earlier + –  Output and supply 33 The 2001 Census The 2001 Census estimated that the UK population was 58.8 million on Census day, 29 April.  This was about 1.2 million less than the mid-2001 projection of the population by the Government Actuary’s Department (GAD).  The ONS currently judges that most of this discrepancy is a result of underestimation of emigration(1)—in particular of men between  25 and 44 years of age (see Chart A)—although the precise causes are uncertain and other explanations are possible.  In light of the Census, the 1 991 mid-year estimate of the population has also been revised down, by about 300,000.  As a result, the annual growth rate of the population over the past two decades has also been revised down by an average of around 0.1 percentage points. Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates of the  whole-economy levels of employment and unemployment are grossed up using estimates of  the household population.  So a downward  revision to the population reduces the LFS  estimates of the levels of employment and unemployment.  Moreover, since the Census has  also revised down the estimated share of  prime-age (25–44) men in the population, who  have high participation and employment rates,  these rates are also being revised.  On 30 October  the ONS released provisional regrossed labour  market data for the period 1 992–2001.  These data show that, for example, in June-August 2001,  working-age employment was over 800,000 lower,  at about 26.6 million, and the working-age employment rate was 0.3 percentage points lower at 7 4.3%. Workforce Jobs estimates of employment will be less directly affected, as they are derived primarily from  a survey of companies rather than households and  are not grossed up using the population data.   However, the Workforce Jobs estimates for  self-employment, and employment in the agriculture and construction sectors, are based on LFS data and are therefore likely to be revised.  National Accounts data for GDP are expected to be largely unaffected.  So estimates of labour productivity based on the Workforce Jobs series should be little changed, although estimates derived from LFS employment figures, such as those used in the Bank of England’s main macroeconomic model, will be higher back to the early 1 980s. While the new population figures have important consequences for the interpretation of labour  market data, the MPC has concluded that in broad terms they should not significantly affect the inflation outlook.

(1) The number of births and deaths each year is available from registration records.  The gross flow of migrants is estimated using data from the International Passenger Survey and administrative data on asylum applications and visitors who become permanent residents.  However, there are other data—for example, on applications for permanent settlement and National Insurance numbers—which can be used to corroborate an estimate of the gross inflow.  The determinant of population about which the ONS know least is the gross outflow of migrants.  Hence, in the view of the ONS, the  Census-based revisions most likely reflect changes in the underlying estimates of the gross outflow. year to Q2 (see Chart 3.10), reflecting the buoyancy of  activity in that sector.  The increase in jobs in these two sectors fully offset the decline in manufacturing jobs in this period.   The public sector accounts for nearly 1 8% of jobs.  After  two decades of relative decline, public sector employment  has grown at a slightly faster rate than that of the private sector over the period since 1 999 (see Chart 3.1 1).  As noted above, employment growth has been particularly strong in education and health.  Public spending has risen from 37 .4%  Inflation Report: November 2002 34 of GDP in 1 999–2000 to 39.3% of GDP in 2001–02.  The 2002 Spending Review projects the ratio rising to 41.9%  of GDP in 2005–06.(1) So further significant increases in public sector employment are likely.  But reports from the Bank’s regional Agents suggest that companies’ employment intentions in the private sector have generally weakened a little since Q2. 3.5 Labour supply For a given rate of economic inactivity, an increase in the population of working age would provide an increase in  labour supply in the long term, thereby adding to potential output.  In the shorter term, the most obvious sources of additional labour are the economically inactive and the unemployed.  Working-age population The number of people of working age (1 6–59 for women  and 1 6–64 for men) has risen steadily as a share of the  total population since the early 1 970s (see Chart 3.12).  In  the following decade, an increasing working-age  population mostly reflected a rising birth rate prior to the mid-1 960s, associated with the post-war ‘baby boom’ .   Since then, births generally have been falling.  Nonetheless, the working-age population rate is higher now than in the  late 1 980s.  That reflects inward migration.  The 2001  Census has led to a downward revision in the working-age population rate in 2001 of 0.5 percentage points.  In particular, the ONS believes that the Census has cast doubt  on previous estimates of gross emigration over the past  two decades, notably of men aged 25–44 (see the  box on  page 33).  However, the Census did not change the overall picture of an increasing working-age population rate since 1 971.  The data for working-age population during the past twelve months are still to be revised using the results of the 2001 Census.  On the basis of unrevised data, the working-age population and LFS-based employment have grown at similar rates in the year to June-August and the working-age employment rate has barely changed. Participation Labour force participation trends reveal whether labour supply is rising or falling, relative to the size of the population of working age.

Output and supply 35 The participation rate(1) was broadly unchanged in  June-August compared with the same three months a year earlier (see Chart 3.1 3).  The participation rate has generally been on a modest upward trend since the mid-1 990s.  The female participation rate increased by about 2 percentage points between mid-1 994 and mid-2000.  It fell back a little in the second half of 2001 but it has since been rising again and has now returned to its mid-2000 peak.  Its increase since 1 994 has more than offset a steadily declining rate for men. Increased female participation in part reflects the rise in participation of lone parents.  The activity rate of female lone parents with children under 1 6 was 56% in March-May 2002, up from 50% six years earlier.  The rise in activity of lone parents since 1 996 explains around one third of the  1.6 percentage point increase in the female participation rate in this period.  And they have found jobs:  the employment rate of female lone parents has risen by about 9 percentage points in six years, to around 50% in March-May 2002.  In part these trends have reflected government policy, especially the New Deal for Lone Parents, the Working Families’ Tax Credit and the National Childcare Strategy.(2) The Government has targeted a 70% lone parent employment rate by 2010.  If this were met, and assuming it fully reflected increased activity, rather than falling unemployment, this would increase the overall participation rate by around  0.1 percentage points a year on average during the next eight years—the average rate of increase since 1 995. Unemployment The difference between labour supply and demand is central to the determination of wage inflation.   The most common measure of the excess of labour supply over demand is the unemployment rate.  This has barely changed in the past twelve months.  The claimant count unemployment rate was 3.1% in September and has been 3.1%–3.2% for  1 8 months.  The International Labour Organisation (ILO) definition of unemployment used by the LFS was 5.2% in the three months to August, compared with 5.1% in the same period a year earlier (see Chart 3.1 4).  Despite this small increase, ILO unemployment has been extremely stable over the past twelve months.  Other indicators are generally consistent with the unemployment figures, suggesting that the (1) The participation rate is defined as the economically active of working age as a percentage of the working-age population.  The LFS classifies as ‘economically active’ those people with a job and those who meet the International Labour Organisation definition of unemployment used by the LFS.  Chart 3.1 3 shows the participation rate prior to the revisions resulting from the 2001 Census. These generally reduced its level by about 1/4 percentage point from mid-1 993 to August 2001, mostly reflecting the downward revision to the number of working-age males, who have a relatively high participation rate.

While some surveys and reports from the Bank’s regional Agents indicate a marginal easing in recruitment difficulties, any such slackening appears to be modest.  37 Costs and prices 4 Inflationary pressures are determined by the balance of demand and supply in product and labour markets.  They are also influenced by developments in the exchange rate, overseas prices, and the inflation expectations of employers and employees.  4.1 Earnings and settlements According to the Average Earnings Index (AEI), headline earnings growth has been relatively stable at just below 4% since May.  Whole-economy pay settlements have been stable at around 3% (see Table 4.A).  Private sector earnings growth has recovered from the low rates seen at the start of the year (see Chart 4.1).  The weakness then was caused by lower bonus payments than in 2001.  But in August, for the first time in 1 8 months, bonus payments grew broadly in line with regular pay and so had no net effect on annual private sector pay growth.  Annual earnings growth in the public sector has continued to ease and settlements have remained stable.  In the twelve months to September, public sector settlements were 3.6%, unchanged from August.  Chart 4.2 shows that annual public sector earnings growth was 3.0% in August, almost  3 percentage points below its peak in August 2001.  This softening in public sector pay growth is somewhat at odds with the continued strength in public sector spending (see Section 2) and the growth in public sector employment (see Section 3).  While a number of factors can explain this profile of earnings growth, part of it reflected threshold payments to teachers in 2001, which raised the level of earnings permanently, but raised earnings growth for one year only.  Whole-economy average earnings growth has been stable at just below 4% since May.  In the past three months, oil prices have risen steeply and then fallen, probably reflecting changing market sentiment about the prospect of a military attack on Iraq.  The increase in the price of oil since the beginning of the year is putting some upward pressure on manufacturers’ input costs and output prices.  RPIX inflation rose to 2.0% in the year to Q3;  goods prices continued to fall and strong retail services price inflation persisted.  The MPC expects RPIX inflation to move above the 2.5% target by the end of the year, largely reflecting the pattern of oil price movements and an increasing contribution from housing depreciation. It is expected to remain above target during much of 2003 and then drop back. Table 4.A Average earnings growth Percentage changes on a year earlier 2002 May June July Aug. Sept.

(b) Twelve-month weighted mean.  The weights are the AEI industry shares of the wage bill.  Sources noted in Table 4.A.  Inflation Report: November 2002 38 Another factor that might explain the recent fall in public sector earnings growth is the delay to this year’s local authority (LA) settlement.  The settlement was due in April,  but not agreed until September.  The higher settlement was due to enter pay packets from October.  As this settlement affects 1.3 million workers (about 25% of the public sector wage bill), the delay has depressed public sector earnings growth.  While the recently agreed LA settlement is likely to raise public sector earnings growth, the arrears of this  settlement (backdated to April) will not.  This is because  the ONS does not include arrears in its seasonally adjusted data. Whole-economy regular pay growth per head has been falling gently since the middle of 2001 (see Chart 4.3).  When calculated in terms of pay per hour, the trend in the growth rate has been much flatter, and has perhaps picked up more recently.  Why might that matter?  If everybody were paid by the hour, then the hourly growth rate would be the more relevant for judging trends in wage pressure.  But as the August Report noted, only about 40% of employees in the economy are paid by the hour, equivalent to a third of the wage bill.  So the pick-up in pay per hour is partly related to the recent sharper fall in average hours.  The ONS presents its average hours data as a three-month moving average.  The final hours observation in Chart 4.3 refers to the three months to August.  So the final three observations in that chart may have been affected by the Jubilee holidays in June. If average hours were to recover, as Jubilee effects pass or for purely cyclical reasons, the gap between pay growth per hour and pay growth per head would narrow, probably with both a slowing in regular pay growth per hour and a pick-up in pay growth per head.  The outlook for real earnings growth depends on employers’ demand for labour relative to the available supply (see  Section 3).  But nominal earnings growth is also influenced by inflation expectations.  Employees care about the purchasing power of their earnings (the real consumption wage) and businesses care about the cost of labour relative to the price of their output (the real product wage).  But because the basic wage is typically set at discrete intervals, usually yearly, employees and employers care about future inflation.   Chart 4.4 shows two measures of inflation expectations, the Quarterly Consensus Forecasts and the Bank of England/NOP survey.(1) Both fell in Q3 from 2.4% to 2.2%.  So inflation expectations seem unlikely to give any upward impetus to wage settlements in the near term.

For the latest survey results see www.bankofengland.co.uk/pressreleases/2002/096.htm  Costs and prices 39 Looking ahead, earnings growth may edge up at the end of the year as local authority employees receive their new settlement. Thereafter earnings growth is likely to increase somewhat through 2003, given the continued tightness of the labour market.  The prices that businesses charge for their products depend, among other things, on the cost of producing those goods or services.  So price inflation can be influenced by changes in unit wage costs.  While transient changes in unit wage costs can affect inflation, it is the underlying growth that is probably more important.  This is because businesses incur costs when they change prices—for example the expense of printing new price lists.  So they are more likely to change prices infrequently and when they are confident that any change is unlikely to reverse.  Though it is often difficult to discern the underlying trend, it is likely that unit wage cost growth in recent quarters has been boosted by a temporary cyclical lull in productivity growth (see Chart 4.5).  Indeed, the MPC projects unit wage cost growth to fall next year as productivity growth is expected to recover. 4.2 Commodity prices After the publication of the August Report, the price of oil continued to increase.  It rose to a peak of $29 per barrel on 23 September.  But it has fallen sharply in recent weeks (see Chart 4.6).  The average price of oil in the 1 5 days to  6 November was $26 per barrel, similar to the 1 5-day average to 3 1 July (the day the MPC finalised its August projections). The gyrations in the price are likely to have been associated with changing market perceptions over the prospect of a military attack on Iraq, and the related risk of disruption to world oil supply.  In the first half of this year, Iraq produced 2.0 million barrels of oil a day, or 3% of world output (see Chart 4.7).  Most countries, with the exception of Saudi Arabia, do not have significant amounts of spare capacity.  In this sense, Saudi Arabia can be thought of as the marginal oil producer, able to influence heavily the price of oil.  Saudi Arabia could increase production by between 2.4–2.7 million barrels a day, within  30 days, enough to offset any Iraqi shortfall.(1) In the near term, market participants appear to expect the oil price to continue to fall to around $22 per barrel in two years’ time.  The profile of the Brent futures price over the next two years is broadly similar to what it was at the time of the August Report.  This profile implies that twelve-month oil price Chart 4.5 Whole-economy unit wage cost and  productivity growth 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 1 995 96 97 98 99 2000 01 02 Percentage changes on a year earlier Productivity growth Unit wage cost growth + _ Chart 4.6 Brent Oil futures 5 10 1 5 20 25 30 35 40 1 995 97 99 2001 03 $ per barrel   6 November (a) August Report (a) 0 Source:  Thomson Financial Datastream and Bank of England.

The impact on annual RPIX inflation is therefore likely to be positive for the remainder of this year—both directly through higher petrol prices and indirectly via the pass-through to higher costs of production—and negative in the second half of 2003. The price of non-oil commodities rose by 6.1% in Q3, mainly due to the higher price of food, which rose by 1 1.3% in Q3. But the futures curve for non-oil commodities—a weighted average of 25 separate commodities—was broadly similar to what it was at the time of the August Report.  Within the total, however, there were offsetting movements.  Food price futures rose (see Chart 4.8) and the price of metals and other  non-food agricultural commodities fell.  The rise in spot and futures food prices was quite broadly based and appears to have been driven by a combination of supply-side factors: droughts in different regions of the world have combined to reduce the supply of wheat, corn and soyabean;  cocoa prices have been affected by political conflict in the Ivory Coast—the world’s largest producer;  and the recent rise in coffee prices was in part due to producers substituting away from coffee, in response to the exceptionally low prices at the beginning of the year. 4.3 Import prices Sterling import prices of goods and services in 2002 Q2 were a little higher than assumed at the time of the August Report. The quarterly change in import prices rose sharply from -0.8% in Q1 to 1.6% in Q2.  Exchange rate changes seem to account for most of the rise in import prices.  The sterling effective exchange rate depreciated by 1.5% between Q1 and Q2.  The weighted average price of exports from the major six (M6) economies (a proxy for the prices of internationally traded goods and services) remained unchanged.  The MPC projection for annual M6 export price inflation is little different to its August Report projection, but the projection for annual UK import price inflation is a little weaker.  In part this can be explained by the around 1% higher starting assumption of the sterling effective exchange rate in the fourth quarter of this year (compared with what was assumed at the time of the August Report) which is likely to lower the sterling price of imports.   4.4 Costs and prices in manufacturing Input prices fell by 1% in the twelve months to September, compared with a fall of 1.9% in the twelve months to August (see Chart 4.9).

And it was the precipitous fall in the price of oil in 2001 (or base effects) dropping out of the annual comparison that accounted for most of the pick-up in the twelve-month rate for September.  The remainder was due to the rise in oil prices since July this year.   Headline annual earnings growth in the manufacturing sector has risen steadily since the start of the year, but manufacturing productivity growth rose more sharply.   Annual earnings growth rose from 2.9% in Q1 to 3.5% in Q2, and annual productivity growth rose from -1.9% to -0.6% over the same period.  These two effects imply that unit wage cost growth eased from 5.0% in Q1 to 4.1% in Q2.  As mentioned above, the underlying growth in costs (of both raw materials and labour) is an important influence on the prices that companies charge for their goods.  But it is not the only factor.  The pressures on capacity and the degree of competition are also important.  Faced with spare capacity (see Section 3) and intense global competition, domestic manufacturing firms have had little scope for passing on cost increases.  In the twelve months to September, output prices (excluding duties) rose by 0.4%, unchanged since August.  4.5 Costs and prices in the service sector Labour costs account for the majority of service sector input costs and so are key to determining the short-run pressures on service sector output prices.  Headline annual earnings growth in the private service sector recovered from 2.2% in Q1 to 4.2% in Q2.  Private service sector productivity growth over the same period fell a little.  Consequently private service sector unit wage cost growth rose from 0.4% in Q1 to 2.6% in Q2, raising cost pressures since the start of the year (see  Table 4.B).  This is consistent with the CIPS survey, which showed a small rise in the balance of firms reporting a rise in input costs since the end of 2001.  But private service sector earnings growth rose between Q1 and Q2 because the large negative bonus contribution to annual earnings growth diminished in Q2.  In terms of regular pay growth, annual private service sector earnings growth did not change much on the quarter.  So underlying private service sector unit wage cost growth, perhaps a more important influence on firms’ prices, was relatively flat. The only official measure of output prices in business services is the ONS’ corporate services price index (CSPI).  This index captures business-to-business transactions only.  This survey remains experimental and to date covers around 50% of its target population.  Importantly, it does not yet include insurance premia which, according to the Bank’s regional Table 4.B Measures of service sector costs and prices(a) 2001 2002 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4(b) Backward-looking CIPS average costs index (c) 51.8 53.1 53.9 54.6 54.2 CIPS average prices  charged index (c) 49.6 50.6 51.6 51.9 52.2 CSPI (d) 4.1 2.8 2.5 n.a. n.a.

The CSPI shows that business services price inflation has been falling since the start of 2001, with the fall being broadly-based across property rental payments, oil-related services (such as sea freight and road transport) and other business services (see Chart 4.10).  The fall in the ONS measure of business services price inflation stands in contrast to the increase in the CIPS balance of firms reporting a rise in prices since the start of the year and the continued strength in retail services price inflation (see Chart 4.1 1).  While a large part of the divergence between business and retail services price inflation is accounted for by the impact of the oil price on oil-related business services, some of it may reflect the differences between the state of demand in the respective sectors. Forward-looking survey indicators offer mixed signals about what might happen to service sector prices in the near future. The volatility of the CBI/Grant Thornton survey makes it hard to read the underlying trend (see Table 4.B).  The BCC survey shows that the balance of respondents expecting to raise prices over the next three months is a little weaker than it was at the start of the year. 4.6 Retail prices Annual inflation in retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments (RPIX) rose by 0.1 percentage points to 2.0% in Q3. This rise was echoed in the other main measures of retail price inflation.  Annual RPIY inflation (which also excludes indirect and local authorities’ taxes) rose by 0.1 percentage points to 1.9%; and the headline rate of inflation (RPI) rose by  0.3 percentage points to 1.5%.  The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) measure of inflation rose by 0.2 percentage points to 1.1% in the year to Q3.  What accounts for the 0.9 percentage points difference between HICP and RPIX inflation in Q3?  RPIX and HICP measure the average price of a basket of goods and services. The formula used to add together the prices in the RPIX measure is different from that used in the HICP index.(1) This ‘formula effect’ accounts for much of the persistence in the gap (see Chart 4.1 3).  The factor that explains most of the current differential is the inclusion of housing costs(2) in RPIX but not in the HICP , and recently house price inflation has been particularly strong (see Section 1). Since the Bank of England was given operational independence in 1 997 , the annual inflation rate of RPIX has been very stable;  it has averaged 2.3% with a standard Chart 4.11 Business and retail services price inflation 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 999 2000 01 02 Percentage changes on a year earlier Businesses (CSPI) Retail    (RPIX services)  Chart 4.12 Retail price inflation 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 1 995 96 97 98 99 2000 01 02 RPI RPIX RPIY Percentage changes on a year earlier (1) RPIX uses the arithmetic mean and HICP the geometric mean to aggregate price quotes at the most detailed level.

This stability has also been evident since inflation targeting was introduced in 1 992. Chart 4.1 4 shows two measures of inflation volatility:  monthly changes to the annual rate of inflation, and the two year rolling standard deviation of the annual rate.  The rolling standard deviation is considerably lower now than it was in the 1 970s.  But recently inflation volatility has ticked up a little. This can be seen from the slightly larger amplitude of the monthly changes in the annual inflation rate in 2001/02. There was also a slight rise in the rolling standard deviation. In the past year the annual inflation rate has changed by  0.5 percentage points or more (from month to month) four times.  The previous time this occurred was in 1 991, but changes then were related to changes in VAT and the council tax.  Most of the recent volatility in RPIX inflation can be attributed to a few components, notably seasonal food and petrol. Indeed, the contribution of these two components alone can explain most of the volatility in RPIX inflation, particularly over the past year (see Chart 4.1 5).  Seasonal food and petrol prices have not been particularly volatile on their own, when compared with past history.  In general, the two series are unlikely to move together because they are influenced by quite different factors:  seasonal food prices are typically affected by weather conditions, whereas the oil price is determined by the interaction of global demand for and supply of oil.  But in the recent past, seasonal food and petrol prices have moved somewhat unusually together for a prolonged period of time (see Chart 4.1 6), giving rise to the volatility in annual RPIX inflation. In September, annual retail services price inflation rose to 4.8% and goods price inflation rose to -0.9% (see Chart 4.17), maintaining the gap between goods and services price inflation at 5.7 percentage points.  The widening in the differential between goods and services price inflation seen during the past four years has not been confined to the United Kingdom;  though less pronounced, it has been a feature of the United States also (see Chart 4.1 8).  One explanation for the fall in goods prices is weak manufacturing input prices (see page 40), magnified by intense global competition in the market for tradable goods. The rise in retail services price inflation since the start of 2001 was mainly due to the increased contribution of leisure and household services.  A large part of the pick-up in leisure services inflation reflected unusually strong increases in cable/satellite TV subscription charges and package holidays abroad.  After 1 1 September 2001, holiday companies were concerned that people would be less willing to fly and so they Chart 4.14 The volatility of RPIX inflation(a) 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 1 970 7 4 78 82 86 90 94 98 2002 Percentage points + _ Rolling standard    deviation (b) Inflation targeting    introduced  Bank    independence  Monthly change    in annual     inflation rate (a) RPI inflation prior to 1 976.

Inflation Report: November 2002 44 cut back supply.  The subsequent price rise suggests that demand may not have fallen back by as much as they had expected.  Household services inflation has risen sharply mainly because telephone charges (both for mobile phones and land lines) have not fallen at the rates they had done in previous years. Looking ahead, the MPC expects that annual RPIX inflation will move above the target by the end of the year.  This projected increase is mostly accounted for by two components: petrol prices and housing depreciation.  The strength of oil prices now compared with the oil price in 2001 Q4 implies that the contribution from petrol prices to annual inflation is expected to rise in 2002 Q4.  The housing depreciation component measures the costs that owner-occupiers face to maintain the quality of their home.  It is meant to capture large infrequent renovations, like replacing a roof.  As housing depreciation is not directly measured, it is proxied by a weighted average of lagged house prices, as measured by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) house price index.  This method of calculation means that the current strength in house price inflation will continue to have a further upward impact on RPIX inflation in the coming months.  The MPC expects RPIX inflation to remain somewhat above the target of 2.5% for much of 2003.  Then inflation may drop below 2.5%, before gradually approaching the target by the end of the forecast horizon.  The projection is described in greater detail in Section 6.

Four-quarter GDP growth was expected to return gradually to around-trend rates.  The MPC judged that the risks relative to the central projection were weighted marginally on the downside for growth and slightly on the upside for inflation. At its meeting on 4–5 September, the Committee first discussed the world economy.  Equity markets had stabilised during August, above the low points reached in July, but had recorded further sharp falls in the days leading up to the Committee’s meeting.  However, equity markets remained volatile and little significance could be attached to short-term movements.  Long-term forward interest rates had fallen in the major economies, reversing increases earlier in the year.  The fall seemed largely to represent lower real rates.  It was possible that it reflected market doubts about the speed of recovery, or that the volatility in equity markets had increased the attractiveness of government bonds.  But it was not obviously related to any particular economic news. Recent data from the United States were broadly consistent with the Committee’s August projections.  Economic news from the euro area continued to be weaker than expected and it was still unclear whether sustained recovery in Japan was under way, although the rest of Asia seemed to be growing quite strongly.  A number of Latin American countries continued to face severe economic problems although there was more positive news on the month from Brazil and Argentina. UK monetary data had shown signs of slowing.  The corporate sector, including financial companies, had accounted for the This section summarises the economic developments and monetary policy decisions taken by the MPC since the August Report.(1) The Bank’s repo rate was maintained at 4% in September, October and November. (1) The minutes of the August, September and October meetings are reproduced under a separate cover, published alongside this Report.  Inflation Report: November 2002 46 easing.  Household borrowing had remained strong and mortgage equity withdrawal as a percentage of personal disposable income was close to the rates seen in the late 1 980s.  While monetary and some housing indicators suggested that consumption still had considerable momentum, retail sales growth had eased in July and survey evidence pointed to further weakening in August.  The latest data suggested that labour demand might be a little weaker than expected.  RPIX inflation had picked up sharply in July and had been stronger than expected.  In discussing the immediate policy decision, the Committee noted that the world economy was a little weaker than it had appeared to be a month earlier.  UK consumption growth and house price inflation were showing tentative signs of slowing and the key issue was how much weight should be put on these signals.  A slowing in consumption growth would be unwelcome if it were too abrupt or too early, particularly if the recovery in world activity were to be less strong.  Against this background, the Committee considered whether pre-emptive action to delay the slowing in consumption growth might be warranted.  However, the Committee agreed that it was premature to conclude that further stimulus was necessary. Once allowance had been made for the effects of Jubilee holidays on the pattern of output, there was little evidence that the UK recovery was faltering, and the evidence of consumption growth slowing prematurely was not clear cut. Reducing interest rates at this stage could encourage households to accumulate yet more debt and renew the upward pressure on house prices.   The Committee noted that a decision to maintain the repo rate at 4% did not represent a lack of policy response to the  slower-than-expected recovery in world activity and falls in equity prices.  For much of this year the prospects had been that inflation would be moving sharply above target at the  two-year horizon, and it had been widely expected that official interest rates would by now need to be on an upward path. That the repo rate had still not increased in itself represented a response to the changed prospect for inflation.  This was reflected in lower market interest rates, maintaining monetary conditions which continued to support the growth of domestic demand. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the Bank’s repo rate at 4%. At its meeting on 9–10 October, the Committee began by considering the world economy.  The main development since their previous meeting had once again been the substantial fall in most leading equity market indices.  Monetary policy since the August Report 47 The US economy still seemed to be evolving broadly as envisaged in the August Report, while economic news from the euro area had been a little weaker than the Committee had expected.  But the export-led recovery in Japan appeared to be continuing, while domestic demand in several other Asian economies was now growing robustly.  For the world economy as a whole, the latest indicators and the falls in equity prices, if sustained, suggested that prospects for activity might be a little weaker than envisaged at the time of the August Report. In the UK economy, equity prices had fallen by less than in most other major markets over the month and the sterling exchange rate had risen to 11/2% above the level assumed for the third quarter at the time of the August Report.  Since the August Report, government bond rates had fallen by less than in the United States and the euro area, while investment-grade corporate bond spreads had risen by less.  This was consistent with a relative improvement in UK growth prospects.  House prices had continued to rise sharply, although there were some tentative indications that activity in the housing market might be slowing.  The greater-than-expected rise in house prices would tend to offset the influence of falling equity prices on consumption, and might lead to stronger near-term prospects for consumption than envisaged in the August Report. Consumption had grown slightly faster in Q2 than predicted in the Committee’s forecast, but was expected to grow more slowly in Q3 as the timings of the Jubilee and Easter holidays had affected the profile of retail sales.  There had also been a very sharp decline in car sales.  But there were also signs of continuing strength.  Retail sales had risen by 0.6% in August. And the GfK survey had shown households’ confidence in their own economic position over the next twelve months to be at a record high. Business investment was broadly unchanged in Q2.  Although a further fall had been anticipated, revisions to back data meant that the level of business investment in Q2 was broadly in line with the August Inflation Report.  Manufacturing output and industrial production had been weaker than expected.  Current indicators were consistent with a very modest easing in the labour market.  There was little sign of any overall change in pay pressures, and private sector settlements were lower than this time last year.  RPIX inflation was 1.9% in the year to August, but was expected to rise towards, and possibly above, the 2.5% target by the end of the year. While discussing the immediate policy decision, the Committee noted that the news over the month suggested that the prospects for the world economy were slightly weaker than envisaged in the August Report, largely reflecting  Inflation Report: November 2002 48 developments in the euro area.  Downside risks to the world economy also appeared greater and the recent falls in equity prices, if sustained, posed a further risk to the outlook.  The Committee agreed that the key issue was whether, in the face of continuing slow growth in external demand, monetary policy should provide a further stimulus to domestic demand.   The Committee identified a number of possible reasons for reducing the repo rate.  First, the outlook for the global economy was a little weaker.  Second, equity prices had fallen further and the rise in sterling had not proved temporary. Third, the downside risks to the outlook had increased. Finally, the profile of inflation had already been expected to be below target for most of the next two years at the time of the August Inflation Report, and an interest rate reduction had been under consideration for some time, so on this view the recent news would justify a reduction in rates without waiting for the next quarterly forecast.   The Committee also identified possible arguments for leaving the repo rate unchanged:  the continued resilience of domestic demand;  a rising profile for inflation at the end of the forecast horizon in the August Report;  and the difficulty in precisely quantifying the net effect on inflation of changes to equity and house prices, the exchange rate and other news. It was not clear either that the world outlook would be significantly softer than in the August Report. The Committee agreed that the decision remained finely balanced.  Most members, weighing the arguments, preferred to leave the repo rate unchanged.  Others regarded news in the past month, together with other news since August, as sufficient to warrant an immediate reduction to official interest rates. The Committee voted by 6 to 3 to maintain the repo rate at 4%. At its meeting on 6–7 November, the Committee voted to maintain the Bank’s repo rate at 4%.  49 Prospects for inflation 6 6.1 The inflation projection assumptions Supported by macroeconomic policy, the gradual strengthening in world activity has continued in recent months.  But the recovery remains patchy and uneven, and there continues to be considerable uncertainty surrounding the pace and solidity of the global upswing.   Business and consumer confidence indicators show no clear pattern at the global level:  although some measures point to a gradual improvement in activity, others signal some loss of impetus.  Financial markets remain unsettled.  Following the steep decline in June and July, global equity prices fell further in the late summer.  Although prices have recovered ground in recent weeks, equities remain well down on levels earlier in the year.  Market volatility remains high by historical standards. Short-term market interest rates and long-term bond yields have declined again, consistent with some weakening in the near-term demand outlook, although lower interest rates should also help to promote a stronger recovery in activity subsequently.  The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to 1.25% on 6 November to provide a further stimulus to the recovery in the United States.  The resilience of the upturn in the United States remains hard to gauge.  GDP rose by 0.8% in 2002 Q3, much higher than expected three months ago.  But the strength can be largely traced to the impact of special incentives on automobile sales which provided a temporary boost to consumer spending. The Committee’s current projections for output growth and inflation are described below.  Based on the assumption that official interest rates are maintained at 4%, the central projection is that four-quarter growth in UK GDP is likely to settle around trend over the next two years, as the gradual improvement in global demand, continued strong growth in public spending, and a moderate recovery in business investment counterbalance some easing in consumer spending growth.  RPIX inflation is likely to rise above target in the coming months, reflecting the pattern of oil price movements and the effects of high house price inflation on housing depreciation.  As these unusual influences unwind, RPIX inflation may run slightly below the 2.5% target in the second year of the projection, but pick up very gradually to around target by the two-year horizon.  The medium-term outlook for inflation is marginally weaker than in August.  There remain a number of major risks and uncertainties around the central projection, principally stemming from international prospects and the outlook for UK consumer spending.  If they were to crystallise, these risks could have a material impact on UK inflation prospects.  Inflation Report: November 2002 50 High levels of secured borrowing are also supporting household demand, although consumer confidence has fallen markedly in recent months.  The sharp decline in equity wealth over the past year, weak labour market trends, and relatively subdued growth in household income may be weighing on confidence and spending plans.  The near-term outlook is for slower growth in consumer spending.  Moreover, any recovery in business investment is likely to be relatively sluggish, given little pressure on capacity and high levels of uncertainty which encourage companies to delay capital expenditure.  The Committee judges that US GDP growth will ease in the fourth quarter with a slowdown in consumer spending.  Thereafter, growth should strengthen gradually, underpinned by continued improvements in productivity and the low level of interest rates.  Taking the further easing of policy into account, the outlook is broadly similar to the August central projection. Output growth in the euro area remains sluggish, with little or no increase in domestic demand over the past year.  Consumer spending has risen only marginally over this period.  The recent pattern of household spending in the euro area is much weaker than in the United States or the United Kingdom, perhaps reflecting a combination of factors such as:  slower growth in real disposable income;  higher levels of unemployment, which may have depressed consumer confidence;  and a less buoyant housing market in the larger economies which has consequently provided less additional collateral to support a rise in household credit.  Moreover, the low level of construction investment in Germany following the post-reunification boom has exacerbated the contraction from the recent decline in the global demand for plant and machinery, and thus has amplified the investment cycle in the euro area.  The Committee continues to expect a modest recovery in euro-area GDP growth over the forecast period. But, reflecting the weaker-than-expected domestic demand outturns for this year, the prospective pick-up may be a little more muted than thought likely three months ago. There is little change to the outlook in the rest of the world. The most likely outcome in Japan is for a weak cyclical recovery;  prospects remain highly uncertain given the continuing challenge of non-performing loans.  Growth elsewhere in Asia held up relatively well during the global downswing, bolstered by robust domestic demand.  External demand nonetheless remains an important spur, and growth in the region is likely to strengthen further in line with the recovery in the major industrial economies. Drawing together the picture from different regions, the Committee continues to assume that there will be a gradual strengthening in UK-weighted world demand and trade over  Prospects for inflation 51 the forecast period, fostered by the stimulative stance of policy.  Annual global GDP growth is likely to return to around trend rates in the second year of the projection.  Taking into account the lower level of market interest rates, the global prospects are broadly similar to those in the August Report.  The upswing in the world economy is not yet durably entrenched, however, and there are downside risks to the global outlook.  Confidence in global equity markets remains fragile.  Moreover, in the United States, the high level of private sector debt and low rate of household saving continue to be sources of particular vulnerability.  Indeed, the drop in US consumer confidence in recent months could foreshadow a weaker outlook for household spending than currently envisaged, and that in turn could check the upward momentum in overall activity.  And, in the euro area, given only limited recovery in output growth to date and the absence of any sustained pick-up in domestic demand, there are risks of a renewed downturn in private sector confidence, which could prompt companies and households to rein back spending plans and thus prolong the period of below-trend growth. The most likely prospect for international prices has changed relatively little since August.  Oil prices rose during August and September, given heightened uncertainty regarding military conflict in Iraq and a possible disruption to supplies. But prices fell back in October as market concerns eased.  Oil futures prices, which are used to guide the Committee’s central projection, edge down over the next two years to around the levels expected three months ago.  The projection for non-oil commodity prices is little altered:  a stronger outlook for food prices is largely counterbalanced by a weaker picture for industrial commodities.  More broadly, global inflationary pressures are likely to remain subdued over the forecast period, given the prospect of only a moderate recovery in world output growth.  The outlook for the price of internationally traded goods and services is close to the August projection.  UK import prices also depend on the outlook for sterling exchange rates.  The sterling effective exchange rate index (ERI) has changed little over the past three months.  In the  1 5 working days to 6 November, the sterling ERI averaged 106.3.  That rate has been used as the starting point in the current projection.  It is consistent with bilateral rates of $1.55 and 63 pence against the euro, and is less than 1% above the level assumed in the August Report.  The sterling ERI is assumed to depreciate gently over the forecast period to 104.5 in 2004 Q4. UK equity prices have continued to track international developments closely.  Prices fell sharply in September, but  Inflation Report: November 2002 52 subsequently recaptured much of this additional loss as global markets have rallied in recent weeks.  In the 1 5 working days to 6 November, the FTSE All-Share index averaged 1 955, some 4% below the level for 2002 Q4 incorporated in the August projection.  Maintaining the conventional approach, equity wealth is assumed to rise in line with nominal GDP over the forecast period.   House prices have again risen more quickly than expected in recent months, with both the Halifax and Nationwide reporting increases in the 25%–30% region over the past year. The market remains very buoyant, although there are some tentative signs of moderation looking forward.  In particular, data on new housing reservations and loan approvals are running below levels earlier in the year.  This may herald some easing in activity, as recent price increases have increasingly stretched the affordability of houses in terms of average disposable income.  In the Committee’s central projection, house price inflation slows markedly, with prices broadly stable in two years’ time.  But there are major risks around the assumed path. The MPC’s projections continue to be based on the Government’s nominal public spending plans, which imply further robust growth in government expenditure over the forecast period.  In recent months, tax revenues have fallen short of expectations in the Budget.  In large part that appears to reflect the influence of weaker-than-expected economic growth and the impact of the slowdown on revenues linked to the financial services sector.  Based on recent outturns, the Committee has lowered the estimates of future tax revenue.   6.2 The output and inflation projections Output growth in the United Kingdom has continued to recover from the cyclical trough around the turn of the year. According to the preliminary ONS estimate, GDP rose by 0.7% in 2002 Q3, slightly above the revised estimate of growth in the second quarter.  However, recent monthly and quarterly data for production and demand have been affected by the timing of Easter and by the Jubilee holidays, which have clouded the assessment of trends.  Taken together, the Q2 and Q3 GDP estimates are consistent with a gradual rebound in output growth to around long-term trend rates.  Nevertheless, the pick-up in activity over the spring and summer appears somewhat weaker than assumed three months ago. Strong growth in consumer spending has provided the main support to GDP growth in the United Kingdom in recent years.  Robust spending has underpinned domestic demand and cushioned the impact of the recent global downturn. However, the resulting divergence between domestic and  Prospects for inflation 53 external demand has been reflected in uneven pressures on industrial sectors.  It has also been associated with a build-up of household debt to historically high levels in relation to income, which increases the risks of a sharp slowdown in household spending at some point.  Against this background, the outlook for consumer spending remains central to the overall assessment of future aggregate demand conditions. There are some signs of easing in consumer spending growth this year from the pace in 2001, adjusting for the impact of the timing of Easter and the Jubilee Bank Holidays which have affected the monthly and quarterly pattern of expenditure. But to date, the slowdown appears to be moderate and underlying spending growth remains quite strong.  Several factors point to near-term resilience in spending.  Real interest rates are low, and the sharp increase in house prices in recent years has enabled homeowners to borrow more cheaply and to withdraw substantial housing equity against the value of their additional collateral.  Unsecured borrowing is also growing very rapidly.  Unemployment has been maintained at historically low levels over the past year, and consumer confidence remains relatively high.  However, other influences continue to point to a slowdown in spending.  In particular, growth in real post-tax labour income has fallen from the rapid rates in recent years, and the sharp fall in equity prices this year has reduced household financial wealth considerably.   The Committee continues to expect a further slackening in the growth of consumer spending over the forecast period.  The recent strength of the housing market is likely to sustain growth in credit and spending for a while, with consumption decelerating more sharply as house price inflation slows. Moreover, real household income growth is likely to remain relatively subdued for some time, as employment growth falters, and as the increase in National Insurance Contributions in April 2003 reduces take-home pay.  And, although the links between equity prices and consumer spending are uncertain, the sharp drop in financial wealth over the past two years should encourage households to make additional savings over the forecast period in order to rebuild their balance sheet positions.  The central projection is that quarterly consumer spending growth will be relatively robust around the turn of the year, following a weak third quarter, but will then moderate through 2003 to a little below long-run trend rates.  Largely echoing changes to the assumed profile of house price inflation, consumer spending growth may be a little stronger in the first year of the projection than assumed in August, and a little weaker in the second year. Business investment remains depressed.  Investment has fallen in each of the past six quarters, and in 2002 Q2 capital spending was almost 1 1% down on levels a year earlier.  Inflation Report: November 2002 54 Cutbacks have been equally sharp across the manufacturing and service sectors.  There is little likelihood of an imminent turnaround in investment spending.  There are few signs of emerging strains on plant capacity:  although there are significant differences across sectors, capacity utilisation, on average, is marginally below normal levels.  And, although aggregate profits have edged up in recent quarters, capital gearing at market values has increased given the recent sharp fall in equity prices, which has added to pressure on corporate balance sheets. Internal funds for investment may also be lowered by additional payments to finance pension fund shortfalls brought about by falling equity values.  Moreover, uncertainty about the global recovery continues to provide companies with an incentive to postpone investment.  Reflecting these factors, investment intentions surveys have generally weakened over the past quarter.  The Committee’s central projection is that business investment will dip a little further in the second half of 2002, and will then pick up gradually thereafter. Although business investment may rise a little faster than GDP over the forecast period, the recovery in investment is likely to be restrained:  in particular, the level of business investment by the end of 2004 is expected to remain below the level at the end of 2000.  The trend in whole-economy investment is likely to continue to be a little stronger than that for business investment, primarily reflecting the vigorous growth in public sector investment incorporated in spending plans. Lower inventory investment subtracted significantly from aggregate demand in 2002 Q2.  Surveys of manufacturing firms, in particular, reported that companies were seeking to cut stock levels to lower financing costs and improve cash flow. In some cases, the shutdown in production in the Jubilee Bank Holiday week may have provided an opportunity for companies to meet final demand by reducing inventories.  The latest CBI Industrial Trends Survey suggests that the correction of manufacturing inventories may be drawing to an end, thus providing a one-off boost to total demand and output.  Combined with reports from the CBI Distributive Trades Survey suggesting that distribution firms added to stock levels, whole-economy inventory investment is likely to have supported GDP growth in 2002 Q3.  There is little sign from surveys or reports to the Bank’s Agents of any major imbalance in aggregate inventory holdings.  The Committee has consequently maintained the assumption that stock levels rise broadly in line with output over the forecast period. The monthly and quarterly pattern of trade flows has also been volatile this year.  Following a sharp bounceback in 2002 Q2, monthly data point to a fall in export volumes in the third quarter, suggesting that the Q2 outturn exaggerated the  Prospects for inflation 55 strength of the underlying recovery in international demand for UK goods.  Indeed, recent monthly outturns have been surprisingly low in relation to estimates of global demand and the relative prices of UK exports.  Although some of the unexplained weakness is likely to be erratic, the Committee judges that the low outturn may also signify a more depressed underlying position.  The Committee continues to expect a steady recovery in exports over the next two years, predicated on the assumption of a gradual strengthening in external markets.  Nevertheless, export prospects are less bright than assumed in the August Report, reflecting the combination of a weaker-than-expected starting level, and a slightly stronger profile for the sterling effective exchange rate. Import volumes have also been relatively weak in recent months and have fallen short of the level expected in the August Report.  Looking back over the past year, it appears that the lower-than-expected level of imports in relation to UK aggregate demand can largely be explained by the compositional changes within spending:  in particular, given the high proportion of capital goods that are imported, the steep fall in business investment is likely to have had a major counterpart in reduced imports.  Drawing on disaggregated information on the outlook for the main components of aggregate demand, import growth is likely to rise over the forecast period.  Moreover, import growth may rebound more quickly than export growth.  In consequence, following the erratic substantial positive contribution of net trade to GDP growth in 2002 Q2, net trade is likely to remain a brake on output growth over the next two years, although the restraint may fade by the end of the period as the global upswing gathers strength.  The Committee’s current projection for the four-quarter growth in GDP is shown in Chart 6.1.(1) It is based on the assumption that official interest rates are maintained at 4%.(2) Four-quarter growth in GDP recovered to 1.7% in 2002 Q3 from the low point of 1.0% in 2002 Q1.  On the central projection, four-quarter GDP growth is expected to pick up further to a little above long-run trend rates by early 2003, before settling around trend thereafter.  Robust household and public spending are likely to provide the main impetus to GDP growth over the next six months.  As consumer spending growth is then likely to slow, the steady upturn in global demand and the moderate recovery in business investment are expected to support the continued strong expansion in public spending, maintaining overall GDP growth around trend.  The central projection is broadly similar to the August projection, with growth a little stronger in the short run, and slightly Chart 6.1 Current GDP projection based on constant nominal interest rates at 4% + – Percentage increase in output on a year earlier 1998 99 2000 01 02 03 04 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for GDP growth  in the future.

(2) An alternative projection based on market interest rate expectations is shown in Chart 6.5 below.  Inflation Report: November 2002 56 weaker in the medium term.  The change in the profile for consumer spending largely accounts for the small difference.  As expected, RPIX inflation has bounced back from the low point of 1.5% in June.  Indeed, RPIX inflation averaged 2.0% in 2002 Q3, slightly higher than in Q2, and a little above the August central projection.  RPIX inflation has remained volatile and the underlying trend hard to determine, as the twelve-month rate has been buffeted by the emergence and subsequent unwinding of a number of temporary influences on the price of relatively erratic components such as seasonal food and petrol.  The rapid increase in house price inflation over the past year has also had a pronounced direct impact on the housing depreciation component.  The marked divergence between services and goods price inflation has persisted, related to differences in demand conditions as well as in productivity growth. The prospects for inflation depend on the pressures exerted by demand in relation to the sustainable supply capacity of the economy.  Previous Reports have spelled out the challenges and uncertainties involved in forming estimates of sustainable supply capacity.  Given little new information, the Committee has maintained the same assumption on the near-term growth in potential supply capacity as in the August Report.  Overall pay pressures remain subdued.  Whole-economy earnings growth per employee continues to run a little below 4% per annum, even though bonuses no longer appear to be falling and the downward impact on earnings growth from this source has come to an end.  Moreover, average pay settlements over the past year remain around 3%.  Underlying earnings growth may, however, be slightly higher than measured, as the delayed settlement for local government workers is not yet captured in the data.  Furthermore, average hours worked per head have fallen significantly over the past year, pressing down on total earnings:  pay per hour is consequently rising more quickly than pay per employee. Inflation expectations appear relatively well-anchored to the inflation target and seem unlikely to be a source of particular pressure on nominal earnings.  The outlook for real earnings growth depends on employers’ demand for labour in relation to the available supply, as well as on the growth of labour productivity.  There may have been a weakening in aggregate labour demand in recent months, as total hours worked have fallen, although the downward trend is likely to be exaggerated by the Jubilee holiday distortions.  In addition, LFS employment is rising less quickly.  Moreover, some surveys and reports from the Bank’s regional Agents indicate a marginal easing in recruitment difficulties, although  Prospects for inflation 57 the pattern is far from uniform, and any such slackening appears very small.  Indeed, unemployment remains stable at historically low levels.  Overall labour market conditions remain tight. Productivity growth per person has been exceptionally weak over the past 1 8 months or so, as LFS employment growth remained relatively resilient despite the slowdown in GDP growth.  Output per hour has held up better, as average hours worked have fallen, perhaps in part temporarily as firms have lowered overtime to reduce costs, but also perhaps reflecting a desire from some employees to work shorter hours and to seek part-time rather than full-time work.  In aggregate, employers have sought to retain labour and in some cases to expand their headcount, presumably on the assumption that the downturn would be relatively shallow and short-lived, and recognising that the costs of shedding labour and subsequently recruiting and retraining could be substantial in a tight market.  In addition, public sector recruitment has also increased over this period, helping to underpin demand.  Looking forward, projected growth in output at around trend rates would typically be associated with a steady increase in labour demand.  However, in the initial phase of recovery, companies are likely to be able to supply the extra output by working off any ‘hoarding’ of labour during the downswing, and by taking the opportunity to rebuild productivity to more normal levels. As a result, although public sector demand is likely to continue to rise given the planned expansion of public services, total numbers employed could be relatively little changed over the next year or so.  Given steady growth in the working-age population, labour market conditions could consequently ease slightly for a time. Drawing together the various influences on pay, nominal earnings growth is likely to edge up a little in the near term.  A number of factors are likely to provide some upward pressure: the payment of the delayed local authority settlement;  the current tightness of the labour market;  and the prospective rise in inflation outturns.  But the upward trend in earnings is unlikely to be sustained beyond 2003, as the projected slight easing in labour market conditions should help to contain any increase in pay pressure.  Unit wage costs may rise a little less quickly over the forecast period than over the past year, as the cyclical recovery in productivity growth is likely to exceed the pick-up in earnings growth.  But the benign implications for unit labour costs, which include employers’ social contributions and other non-wage employment costs in addition to wages, will be tempered by the increase in National Insurance contributions next year.  Moreover, in terms of the impact on prices, companies may well pay more attention to a smoothed or trend measure of unit labour costs which attaches less weight to cyclical fluctuations.   Inflation Report: November 2002 58 The Committee’s latest projection for the twelve-month RPIX inflation rate is presented in Chart 6.2.(1) The projection is based on the assumption that official interest rates are maintained at 4% over the forecast period.(2) It is shown alongside the August projection, which was also conditioned on interest rates remaining at 4% (see Chart 6.3). The central projection is that RPIX inflation is likely to move somewhat above target by the end of the year and may remain a little above target through much of 2003.  Inflation is then expected to edge down slightly and to run a little below the target, although inching up very gradually to around the target level by the two-year forecast horizon.  Two factors account for the near-term pick-up in RPIX inflation.  First, global oil prices in late 2002 are much higher than in late 2001, when prices dipped sharply in the aftermath of the 1 1 September terrorist attacks.  Second, the sharp increase in UK house price inflation continues to boost the housing depreciation component of RPIX.  Both influences are likely to be transitory. The twelve-month change in oil and petrol prices is likely to decline during 2003, and indeed may well reverse sign by the end of the year.  It is highly unlikely that house price inflation can persist for long at the current unsustainable pace.  So the projected near-term increase in RPIX inflation may exaggerate the strength of underlying inflationary pressure somewhat. Abstracting from these temporary influences, RPIX inflation appears likely to be broadly flat over the forecast period around the 2.5% target level.  Reflecting the prospect of UK GDP in broad balance with supply capacity, underlying Chart 6.3 RPIX inflation projection in August based on constant nominal interest rates at 4% 0 1 2 3 4 5 Percentage increase in prices on a year earlier 2.5 1998 99 2000 01 02 03 04 Chart 6.2 Current RPIX inflation projection based on constant nominal interest rates at 4% 0 1 2 3 4 5 Percentage increase in prices on a year earlier 2.5 1998 99 2000 01 02 03 04 The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for RPIX inflation in the future.  The darkest band includes the central (single most likely) projection and covers 10% of the probability.  Each successive pair of bands is drawn to cover a further 10% of probability, until 90% of the probability distribution is covered.  The bands widen as the time horizon is extended, indicating increasing uncertainty about outcomes.  See the box on pages 48–49 of the May 2002 Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents. (1) Also shown as Chart 2 in the Overview. (2) An alternative projection based on the assumption that interest rates follow market expectations is illustrated below in Chart 6.4.  Prospects for inflation 59 domestic inflationary pressures are expected to be relatively stable.  External influences on prices may be a little stronger than in the recent past, but are also expected to show no clear trend over the forecast period. Compared with the August projection, RPIX inflation is likely to be noticeably higher over the next year or so, principally reflecting the recent spike in oil prices and the direct effect, via the housing depreciation component, of the persistence of high house price inflation.  But inflation is expected to be marginally lower in the second year of the projection than in August, principally reflecting slightly softer external pressures on inflation. Financial market participants have again lowered their expectations of the likely level of official interest rates in the United Kingdom over the next two years.  Employing the  same approach as in previous Reports, and based on a  1 5 working-day average to 6 November, market expectations were consistent with the possibility of a slight reduction in official interest rates in the coming months, with the prospect of a reversal by the end of 2003 and a slight increase thereafter to around 41/2% by the end of 2004 (see Table 6.A). The Committee’s latest projections based on this interest  rate trajectory are shown in Charts 6.4 and 6.5.  The differences from the constant interest rate projections are negligible.  There remains considerable uncertainty surrounding the prospects for output growth and inflation.  The Committee has continued to calibrate the variance of the fan chart drawing on the experience of previous forecast errors.

Judgments about these risks consequently form a key consideration in gauging the appropriate level of interest rates. First, as outlined above, there is a risk that the world recovery could still falter.  A much weaker international outlook would have a substantial impact on the prospects for UK GDP growth and inflation. Second, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the outlook for consumer spending in the United Kingdom, which is closely linked to the prospects for the housing market. House price increases at current rates are clearly unsustainable.  The central projection incorporates a sharp slowdown in house price inflation, with prices broadly stable in two years’ time.  But there are large risks to this view.  Given current high levels of consumer confidence and low unemployment, there is a possibility that continued rapid house price inflation could persist for a time, fuelling a further expansion of household debt and supporting stronger consumer spending than in the central projection.  But the longer house prices rise at an unsustainable pace, and the larger the build-up of household debt, the greater the risk of a sharp correction at some point.  There are consequently both major upside and downside risks to the outlook for consumer spending and inflation arising from the potential instability in current housing market trends.

Because of the difficulties in precisely quantifying  low-probability events, probabilities of less than 5% are not shown  in this chart.  Prospects for inflation 61 Third, the Committee has maintained the view from previous Reports, that there is a risk that the pass-through into wages and prices of the increase in National Insurance contributions next year could be higher than in the central projection. There is a small upside risk to the central projection for inflation and a slight downside risk to the outlook for GDP growth from this source. The risks to the outlook are therefore substantial.  A material change in the prospects for the world economy or for the UK housing market could have a profound impact on UK inflation prospects.  But given the large and uncertain risks in both directions, the best collective judgment of the Committee is that the risks around the central projection from these factors are broadly balanced over the forecast period.  Reflecting the possible impact of the rise in National Insurance contributions, the Committee judges that, relative to the central projection, the overall risks to growth are weighted marginally to the downside, with those to inflation slightly on the upside.  The probabilities of various outcomes for RPIX inflation and GDP growth are presented in Charts 6.6 and 6.7 . The overall balance of risks to the inflation outlook at the  two-year horizon is illustrated in Chart 6.8, together with the corresponding balance in the August Report (see Chart 6.9). Bearing in mind the major uncertainties, individual Committee members hold a range of views on the overall balance of risks, although the range of opinion is relatively narrow.

Given that the central projection of inflation was close to target, and that the large and uncertain risks appeared at present to be in broad balance, the Committee voted to maintain the Bank’s repo rate at 4%.    Prospects for inflation 63 In October, the Bank asked a sample of external forecasters for their latest projections of inflation and output.  The average forecast for the twelve-month rate of RPIX inflation in 2002 Q4, based on the results of this survey, was 2.3% (with a range of 1.9% to 2.6%) rising to 2.4% in 2004 Q4 (with a range of 1.7% to 3.7%).  Compared with the survey results in the August Report, the average forecast for inflation at the  two-year horizon was slightly lower.  The distribution of the forecasters’ central projections has the greatest number of respondents expecting inflation to be between 2.1% and 2.4% (see Chart A).  In August, the most popular range was between 2.4% and 2.7%.  On average the external forecasters see a 64% probability of inflation being at or below 2.5% in 2004 Q4 (see the table below). The forecasters’ average projection for four-quarter GDP growth in 2002 Q4 was 2.1% (with a range of 1.6% to 2.5%), which was somewhat lower than the average forecast reported in August.  The average projection for GDP growth in 2004 Q4 was 2.6% (with a range of 2.2% to 3.5%). The average forecast for the official interest rate in 2002 Q4 was 4.0% (ranging from 3.8% to 4.5%), rising to 5.2% by 2004 Q4 (with a range of 4.5% to 5.9%).  The forecast for 2002 Q4 was slightly lower than the average forecast in August, but the forecast at the two-year horizon was unchanged.  On average, forecasters expect that the sterling ERI will be 105.4 in 2002 Q4 (ranging from 101.0 to 1 10.6), falling to 101.4 by 2004 Q4 (ranging from 95.0 to 1 10.7).

Arable yields were substantially above 2001 levels, contributing to continued weakness in cereals prices.     ● The recovery in manufacturing output remained slow and uneven.  Sub sectors such as civilian aerospace and telecommunications were still depressed, whereas companies producing goods for the public sector, construction or consumers reported increases in output.          ● Growth in construction output began to moderate and the balance of orders continued to shift away from commercial buildings to public sector projects.  Strong demand for new houses continued.  Though there was some easing in the secondary market for higher priced houses, there was no indication of slower demand for other types of property.  ● The picture for business services was mixed, with growth in many sectors contrasting with weakness in financial and related services in the London area.  Demand for consumer services continued to grow, although overcapacity was becoming evident for some leisure facilities.         ● Growth in consumer spending moderated slightly over the period and the outlook was more uncertain.  Sales of new cars were lower than expected in September stimulating manufacturers’ promotions the following month. Discounting of flights and hotel rooms had boosted demand for short breaks.   ● Growth in demand from some smaller export markets did not fully compensate for continued weakness in demand from Germany and the United States.  Import penetration continued to increase.   ● Low profitability, volatility in world equity markets and weaker confidence resulting from the threat of war with Iraq had led to renewed caution about investment among manufacturing and business services contacts.     ● Prices of some raw materials rose during the period, although weak global demand allowed buyers to limit the impact of increases through more efficient purchasing.  Some cost increases, such as insurance premia, were less easy to resist.  Manufacturing output prices and some professional fees were subject to downward pressure due to plentiful supply. ● Retail goods price inflation remained muted and prices of new and used cars continued to fall.  Prices of most consumer services, except rates for flights and hotel rooms, continued to rise.  ● The labour market eased slightly as autumn brought more redundancies.  But increased public sector employment contributed to continuing labour shortages in some localities.  Pay pressures remained subdued but total costs rose more substantially for employers who needed to increase pension fund contributions.      This publication is a summary of monthly reports compiled by the Bank of England’s Agents, following discussions with around 2,000 businesses in the period between mid-July and mid-October.  It provides information on the state of business conditions, from firms across all sectors of the economy.  The report does not represent the Bank’s own views, nor does it represent the  views of any particular firm or region.  The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee uses the intelligence provided by the Agents,  in conjunction with information from other sources, to assist its understanding and assessment of current economic conditions. November 2002 (1) The Bank of England has Agencies for Central Southern England, the East Midlands, Greater London, the North East, the North West,  Northern Ireland, Scotland, the South East & East Anglia, the South West, Wales, the West Midlands, and Yorkshire & the Humber.  Inflation Report: November 2002 66 OUTPUT Primary production Agricultural output continued to increase.  Substantially higher yields from the domestic cereals harvest than in 2001, and increasing competition from imports, contributed to prices remaining at long-term lows. Prices for potatoes and other root vegetables were also depressed, in some cases significantly below production costs.  Agencies reported that, as a result, many farmers would cease to grow potatoes.  Restocking of beef and lamb following the end of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) continued, generally to numbers slightly below pre-FMD levels.  Exports of livestock have not yet recovered to  pre-2001 levels.   Manufacturing The gradual and patchy recovery in manufacturing output continued.  Companies producing for the  public sector, for construction, or goods for the consumer were generally seeing some growth in output. Demand for household goods and for processed, chilled and frozen foods continued to increase.  And manufacturers of luxury goods increased their output. Manufacturers of specialist safety equipment benefited from health and safety legislation and insurers’ requirements.  However, increasing import penetration limited the gains from extra demand.  Contacts also reported increasing pressure from customers for stock  to be held by suppliers, as deferral of delivery of orders by customers became more common.  UK manufacturing capacity continued to contract as multinational companies rationalised their production sites, increasingly moving factories to China, eastern  Europe, or consolidating production into fewer European plants. Overcapacity in printing continued.  Expected recoveries in production of chemicals and plastics failed to materialise.  Orders for machine tools and capital goods generally remained weak, and the civilian aerospace and telecommunications sectors showed little sign of recovery. Construction and housing Prospects for construction output have softened since the previous Agents’ Summary.  Current activity remained high, but orders were weaker.  Little work on new commercial buildings was started, unless fully  pre-let, even though investor demand for office and industrial property continued to rise.  Demand for new distribution sheds and development and refurbishment of retail and leisure property remained strong.  However, the balance of activity was shifting more to public sector work on schools, hospitals, social housing, flood protection and transport infrastructure.  Some Private Finance Initiative projects continued to experience long gestation periods.    Growth in house building continued to be constrained by shortages of suitable land and labour.  Strong demand was maintained, with many properties selling before they were built.  In the secondary housing market, some easing in demand for the highest priced properties was apparent, but in most regions there was no indication of slower demand for mid-market properties, or from  first-time buyers.    Services Growth in output of business services remained positive overall, but performance was dependent on the nature  of the customer.  Outsourcing of work, such as recruitment and legal services by the public sector,  was underpinning strong growth for some companies. Those providing services to manufacturing were facing reduced orders, particularly for functions such as maintenance of plant, as production moved overseas  and companies deferred inessential spending. Warehousing demand at ports was in some cases at record levels, reflecting buoyant imports, especially from the Far East. Weak private sector demand was reported in sectors  such as IT services and marketing.  Investment banking and related financial services were particularly subdued in London.  Accountants reported a modest increase  in demand for insolvency and personal bankruptcy  work.          Corporate expenditure on conference facilities, contract catering, taxis, car-hire and international courier services remained depressed.  Business travellers also appeared to be cutting costs by lowering spending on corporate credit cards and increasing use of discount airlines and budget hotels. Demand for consumer services continued to grow but there were signs of overcapacity in some regions in leisure facilities, such as restaurants and fitness clubs. Bookings of long-haul holidays remained below last year’s levels, although travel services as a whole saw some growth.  Housing-related services, such as estate agencies, mortgage providers and solicitors, reported continued buoyant year-on-year growth in volume and value of business.   Agents’ summary of business conditions 67 DEMAND Consumption The rate of growth in consumer spending appeared to have eased somewhat, albeit from strong figures earlier in the year.  Spending on home entertainment electrical goods and garden centre products remained buoyant.   Although early spending on Christmas merchandise was higher than a year ago, retail contacts were nervous that consumer confidence and spending would weaken rapidly if war broke out in the Middle East. Total sales of new cars in the September new registration month were lower than a year earlier, although manufacturers’ promotions succeeded in boosting sales in October.  Over the period, only prestige marques recorded significant growth in sales.  Contacts suggested that a significant proportion of car purchases was financed through mortgage equity withdrawal. The pattern of spending on leisure services was difficult to read.  Demand for short breaks, both in the United Kingdom and European cities, grew strongly but was probably influenced by discounting of flights and rooms. Growth in membership of fitness clubs appeared to be slowing, and some restaurants reported lower average spending per meal in recent weeks.  However, there was little evidence of declining spending in pubs, and spending at tourist attractions was boosted by good weather in September.         Exports and imports There was some growth in exports to the Far East, notably China, Taiwan and South Korea;  and eastern Europe. Demand from the Middle East and Australia also increased.  However, this was insufficient to compensate for a depressed German export market, only a slight upturn from the United States, and business lost to competitors from low-wage economies.  The weaker dollar also lowered margins on US sales.  Optimism about exports in 2003 rose, although an outbreak of hostilities with Iraq would dampen prospects. Import penetration increased further.  German manufacturers targeted the UK market to compensate for weak demand domestically.  And some UK-based companies switched from manufacturing products themselves to sourcing from China or eastern Europe.          Investment The climate for investment has deteriorated since the previous Agents’ Summary.  Cash conservation has increasingly been prioritised, following falls in world equity markets and low profitability.  Weakening confidence resulting from geopolitical uncertainty also led many firms to postpone investment.  In some cases funds earmarked for investment projects were diverted to top up company pension schemes.   Investment in extra capacity by larger manufacturing companies was often directed overseas, to economies with lower labour costs.  Within the United Kingdom, capital expenditure failed to keep pace with depreciation in many cases and some businesses were restricting investment to what was necessary to comply with health and safety legislation.  Projects with substantial and quick paybacks were proceeding, often involving increased automation to reduce labour costs. Agencies reported that many business services companies were deferring capital expenditure due to uncertainty about future levels of demand from their manufacturing customers.  Consumer services companies, however, continued to invest in refurbishment and upgrading of premises in order to retain or improve market share.       COSTS AND PRICES Input prices Contacts continued to report that prices of a variety of raw materials rose during 2002, mitigated in part by changed purchasing practices as weak global demand increased buyers’ negotiating power.  Contacts were increasingly concerned about rising overhead costs.  The most significant increases were in public, product and employers’ liability insurance premia, with the prospect of further substantial rises in the coming year.  Security costs also continued to rise due to insurer requirements or contacts’ own perception of a need for greater protection. Output prices Plentiful supply, increased competition through expanding use of on-line auctions, and customers’ demands for discounts continued to exert downward pressure on manufacturing output prices.  Some manufacturers of niche or luxury products, or those with a dominant market share, were able to raise prices on renewal of contracts, or increase margins on new lines. Most manufacturers, however, were subject to increased competition, including from imports, and had to concede small annual price reductions.  Retailers expected manufacturers to fund an increasing  Inflation Report: November 2002 68 proportion of multibuy promotions, and fashion suppliers were under pressure to concede discounts, because autumn stock had not been selling well in the shops. Service sector output prices continued to rise overall, although there was less upward pressure on some professional fee rates, for example as competition increased among providers of standard accountancy services.  However, consultancy and legal fees continued to increase, by around 5% annually in most cases. Cleaning and security contractors were increasing their prices to reflect an increase in the National Minimum Wage (NMW) to £4.20 in October.                     Retail prices Consumer goods price inflation remained muted with prices of electrical goods continuing to fall.  Weak sales of clothing due to unseasonably warm weather in September resulted in deeper discounting and earlier starts to some mid-season sales.  Contacts reported intensified competitive pressure between supermarkets and the re-emergence of loss leaders.  Use of two-for-one offers increased in health and beauty products, as well as food.   Agencies reported that new car prices were lower  year-on-year.  This had a knock-on effect on prices of used cars, which were already falling as a result of high stock levels.   Price inflation for consumer services continued to reflect increased labour costs.  Price increases of more than 3%, compared with a year earlier, were reported for pub and restaurant meals, theatre tickets, hairdressing, and car leasing and servicing.  Hotel room rates in parts of the United Kingdom had been discounted to boost occupancy rates.  Air fares also fell year-on-year as a result of increased competition. Pay Settlements remained subdued, except in areas of significant skills shortages.  Pay awards in manufacturing were mostly around 2% to 3%, and slightly higher in services, between 2.5% to 4%.  Higher settlements were made where retention of scarce skills was an issue.  Some graduate starting salaries, in areas such as IT, were lower than in Autumn 2001.  There were continued reports of pay freezes and deferral of settlements in both manufacturing and services companies.  Other factors caused total employment costs to rise. Falls in investment values led many employers to review their pension funds, with reports of increases of between 3% and 5% in employer contributions.  Some employers also faced pressure to restore pay differentials following the increase in the NMW.  Firms adjusting pay to meet the increased NMW were mainly outside the South East and included those in cleaning, security, retail, leisure and care.         EMPLOYMENT Another wave of job cuts in manufacturing and professional services companies took effect during the autumn.  This was particularly the case for professional services in London and the South East as the anticipated upturn in mergers and acquisitions work failed to materialise.  Non-replacement of staff choosing to leave or retiring has become a standard policy for contacts in a growing number of areas.  More generally, job creation in the private sector slowed because of uncertainty about future demand.  Evidence of easing in the market included lower voluntary turnover rates among staff and a significantly higher number of applications per advertised vacancy. However, increased public sector employment, notably  in administration, education and health, contributed  to continued labour shortages in some localities. Employment in leisure services, retail and call centres also continued to increase, partly as a result of longer opening hours.  But contacts reported that it remained difficult to recruit for jobs that require working in the evenings and/or weekends.  In some regions of continued labour market tightness, contacts were recruiting from abroad, to acquire specialist skills or simply to ensure adequate levels of low-skilled labour.

2009-05-13,"Inflation Report May 2009   BANK OF ENGLAND Inflation Report May 2009 In order to maintain price stability, the Government has set the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) a target for the annual inflation rate of the Consumer Prices Index of 2%. Subject to that, the MPC is also required to support the Government’s objective of maintaining high and stable growth and employment. The Inflation Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff under the guidance of the members of the Monetary Policy Committee.  It serves two purposes.  First, its preparation provides a comprehensive and forward-looking framework for discussion among MPC members as an aid to our decision making.  Second, its publication allows us to share our thinking and explain the reasons for our decisions to those whom they affect. Although not every member will agree with every assumption on which our projections are based, the fan charts represent the MPC’s best collective judgement about the most likely paths for inflation and output, and the uncertainties surrounding those central projections. This Report has been prepared and published by the Bank of England in accordance with  section 18 of the Bank of England Act 1998.

Over the past three months, yields on gilts eligible for purchase fell, as did those on non-financial corporate debt.  Money growth remained weak but did not yet reflect the full impact of the asset purchase programme.  Growth in bank lending to companies and households remained sluggish, but the Government’s Asset Protection Scheme should improve the resilience of some banks to further losses.  There were also signs that companies were making increasing recourse to the capital markets.  Equity prices rallied over the past month or so but were little changed from the time of the February Report.  The sterling effective exchange rate remained around a quarter below its 2007 peak. The world economy remained in deep recession:  output contracted further and international trade fell precipitously.  The global banking and financial system remained fragile despite further significant intervention by the authorities.  In the United Kingdom, GDP fell sharply in the first quarter of 2009.  But there were promising signs, both in the United Kingdom and globally, that the pace of decline had begun to moderate.  The outlook for domestic economic activity continues to be dominated by opposing forces.  Weak global demand, combined with the process of adjustment under way in the UK economy, as private saving rises and banks restructure their balance sheets, will continue to act as a significant drag on economic activity.  But pushing in the opposite direction, there is considerable economic stimulus stemming from the easing in monetary and fiscal policy at home and abroad, the substantial depreciation in sterling, past falls in commodity prices, and actions by the authorities internationally to improve the availability of credit.  Over the forecast period, that stimulus should lead to a recovery in economic growth, but the timing and strength of that recovery is highly uncertain. CPI inflation remained close to 3%, significantly higher than the 2% inflation target.  Past falls in sterling continued to put upwards pressure on inflation.  But the degree of spare capacity in the economy increased further and the loosening in the labour market contributed to a sharp easing in pay pressures.  CPI inflation is likely to drop below the 2% target later this year.  Under the assumptions that Bank Rate moves in line with market rates and the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves reaches £125 billion, it is more likely than not that CPI inflation will be below the 2% inflation target in the medium term.  But there are significant risks to the inflation outlook in each direction.  The assessment of these risks is key to MPC decisions.  6 Inflation Report  May 2009 Global activity The sharp and synchronised fall in global economic activity continued in the early months of 2009.  Spending on consumer durables and capital goods fell further, reflecting weak consumer and business sentiment and tight credit conditions.  The considerable macroeconomic stimulus implemented by governments and central banks should help to ameliorate the global downturn and business surveys pointed to a moderation in the pace of contraction. The fall in world activity was accompanied by a sharp contraction in international trade flows.  That decline was probably associated with a marked reduction in both inventory holdings and in the demand for capital and consumer durable goods.  The substantial depreciation of sterling should continue to encourage both domestic and overseas spending to switch towards UK-produced goods and services. Domestic demand Falls in business spending accounted for most of the overall decline in domestic demand in the fourth quarter of 2008. Weak and uncertain demand prospects, together with tight credit conditions, led to a further scaling back of capital expenditure.  And companies ran down their stock levels very sharply, significantly amplifying the decline in economic activity. Consumer spending fell by 1% in 2008 Q4, as households saved a higher proportion of their income.  It is likely that households’ spending continued to fall in the first quarter of 2009, weighed down by concerns about job prospects and a desire to strengthen their finances.   The Committee’s projections are based on the fiscal plans set out in the 2009 Budget.  Those plans included some additional discretionary measures which should help to support demand in the near term.  But the projection for public sector net borrowing was revised up substantially and this may pull down on spending if households and companies expect the increased level of borrowing to lead to higher taxes in the future. The outlook for GDP growth GDP was estimated to have fallen by 1.9% in 2009 Q1, a larger decline than anticipated at the time of the February Report. But there were signs from surveys that the rate at which output was contracting had begun to moderate.   Chart 1 shows the Committee’s best collective judgement for four-quarter GDP growth, assuming that Bank Rate follows a path implied by market rates and the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves reaches £125billion and remains at that level throughout the forecast period.

It has been conditioned on the assumption that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves reaches £125 billion and remains there throughout the forecast period.  To the left of the first vertical dashed line, the distribution reflects the likelihood of revisions to the data over the past;  to the right, it reflects uncertainty over the evolution of GDP growth in the future.  If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that the mature estimate of GDP growth would lie within the darkest central band on only 10 of those occasions.  The fan chart is constructed so that outturns are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter green areas on 10 occasions.  In any particular quarter of the forecast period, GDP is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fan on 90 out of 100 occasions.  The bands widen as the time horizon is extended, indicating the increasing uncertainty about outcomes.  See the box on page 39 of the November 2007 Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.  The second dashed line is drawn at the two-year point of the projection.  Overview 7 combined with the process of adjustment under way in the UK economy, as private saving rises and banks restructure their balance sheets, continues to act as a significant drag on UK growth.  But that is counteracted by the considerable stimulus stemming from the easing in monetary and fiscal policy at home and abroad, the substantial depreciation in sterling, past falls in commodity prices, and actions taken by authorities internationally to bolster the availability of credit.  This stimulus, when combined with a turnaround in the stock cycle, should lead to a recovery in economic growth over the forecast period. The timing and strength of that recovery is, however, highly uncertain.  The pace of the recovery may be slowed by a number of factors:  the contraction in world demand and trade may be protracted;  households may save more;  and the availability of credit to companies and households may improve only gradually.  That said, the substantial scale of the stimulus in train may prompt a rapid rebound in activity.  In particular, the impact of monetary policy on nominal spending is more difficult to judge than normal given the use of unconventional measures.  The risks are more than usually interdependent given the importance of credit supply and conditions in the banking system.  On balance, the Committee judged that these factors point to a relatively slow recovery  in economic activity.  The projected distribution for GDP growth is weaker than in the February Report, reflecting  lower-than-expected activity in the first quarter of 2009, both at home and abroad, and a judgement that it is likely to take longer for bank lending to return to normal than assumed in February.  Costs and prices CPI inflation was 2.9% in March, significantly higher than the 2% inflation target.  Measures of households’ inflation expectations changed little and appeared broadly consistent with inflation returning to target in the medium term. Inflation is likely to fall back to below the 2% target later this year, driven in part by diminishing contributions from food and energy prices.  The growing margin of spare capacity will also act to depress wage and price increases.  The labour market has loosened substantially and pay pressures have eased markedly.   The significant depreciation of sterling has, however, raised companies’ import costs.  The continued elevation in CPI inflation in the first few months of 2009 probably owed much to the upward pressure from higher import costs.  The extent to which the adjustment to sterling’s depreciation will come through higher prices rather than lower wages is a key uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook.    8 Inflation Report  May 2009 The outlook for inflation Chart 2 shows the Committee’s best collective judgement for the outlook for CPI inflation, assuming that Bank Rate follows a path implied by market rates and the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves reaches £125 billion.  The outlook for inflation remains extremely uncertain.  The margin of spare capacity that is likely to persist over the forecast period bears down on CPI inflation. That force is partially offset by the upward pressure associated with the pass-through of sterling’s depreciation to consumer prices and by the judgement that inflation expectations remain anchored around the inflation target. The relative magnitude of these opposing influences on inflation is highly uncertain, and there is a range of views on the relative strength of these forces among Committee members.  The downward pressure from the margin of spare capacity will depend on the timing and strength of the recovery, as well as on the impact of the slowdown on the growth of productive supply and on the sensitivity of inflation to the degree of slack in the economy.  The pass-through from the lower level of sterling will depend critically on the behaviour of the labour market and the extent to which companies adjust to higher import costs by lowering wages. The balance of these factors suggest that, conditioned on the monetary policy assumptions described above, it is more likely than not that CPI inflation will be below the 2% inflation target in the medium term.  The projected distribution for inflation in the medium term is higher than in the February Report. Chart 3 shows the projection for CPI inflation conditioned on the assumptions that Bank Rate is held constant at 0.5% and the stock of purchased assets increase to £125 billion.  This suggests that, on those assumptions, the risks of inflation being above or below the 2% target become more evenly balanced towards the two-year horizon. The policy decision At its May meeting, the Committee noted that the immediate prospect was for CPI inflation to fall substantially below the 2% target, while output continued to contract.  But a substantial stimulus was in train which should lead to a recovery in output growth.  There were significant uncertainties regarding the inflation outlook relating to the timing and strength of that recovery and the extent of the pass-through from sterling’s depreciation.  In the light of that outlook, the Committee judged that maintaining Bank Rate at 0.5% and increasing the size of the programme of asset purchases financed by the issuance of central bank reserves by £50 billion to a total of £125 billion was, on balance, most likely to keep CPI inflation on track to meet the 2% inflation target over the medium term.

Chart 3 CPI inflation projection based on constant nominal interest rates at 0.5% and £125 billion asset purchases  Section 1 Money and asset prices 9 1.1 Money and monetary policy The MPC cut Bank Rate to 0.5% in March (Chart 1.1), the lowest level of official interest rates in the Bank’s history.  Also in March, the MPC announced a programme to purchase  £75 billion of medium and long-term government bonds and private sector debt, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves.  In May, the MPC increased the size of the programme to £125 billion.  The objective of this policy is to boost the supply of money in the economy, ease conditions in corporate credit markets, and, ultimately, to raise the rate of growth of nominal demand to ensure inflation meets the 2% target in the medium term.(1) As discussed in Section 2, UK nominal demand growth has fallen to well below its average annual rate of around 5% since the MPC’s inception, a period over which inflation has been, on average, close to target.  Growth in broad money, as measured by M4, has picked up since mid-2008.  But as described in the box on page 13, that pickup wholly reflected strong growth in money holdings of institutions which intermediate between banks.  Growth in a more economically relevant measure of broad money, which excludes such institutions, has slowed broadly in line with nominal spending (Chart 1.2).   As explained in the box on pages 16–17, the MPC’s asset purchases should boost nominal spending through a number of channels.  Although it will be some time before a full assessment of the effectiveness of the purchases can be made, this section discusses some of the immediate consequences of the introduction of the Asset Purchase Facility (APF).  The impact of policy easing will be influenced by the extent to which banks are able to lend and companies and households 1 Money and asset prices Bank Rate has been cut to 0.5%.  The MPC announced purchases of government bonds and private sector debt totalling £125 billion, funded by the issuance of central bank reserves.  Those purchases are intended to boost the growth of money, ease corporate credit conditions and stimulate nominal demand.  The global banking system remained fragile.  In the United Kingdom, banks’ losses increased towards the end of 2008, reflecting increased levels of defaults and lower property prices. The growth of credit to companies and households remained considerably weaker than over the past decade.  House prices continued to fall but housing market activity picked up modestly.  The sterling effective exchange rate appreciated a little, but remained well below its mid-2007 level.

(1) The box on page 10 sets out the factors behind the MPC’s March and April decisions.    10 Inflation Report  May 2009 Monetary policy since the February Report The MPC’s central projection in the February Report, under the assumption that Bank Rate followed a path implied by market rates, was for output to continue to contract in the near term, and for CPI inflation to fall to well below the 2% target in the medium term.  There were significant risks around these projections.  On the downside, the main risk was that the recession would be more pronounced than in the central case, putting further downward pressure on inflation.  On the upside, the main risk concerned the implications of sterling’s depreciation for consumer prices. In the month leading up to the MPC’s meeting on 4–5 March, equity prices had fallen internationally.  Market expectations of Bank Rate had declined on the month.  Short to  medium-term nominal forward rates had also decreased, by as much as 45 basis points.  It was likely that this, in part, reflected increased expectations of gilt purchases for monetary policy purposes.  The sterling exchange rate index was little changed on the month.  Output had weakened considerably across a wide range of economies in 2008 Q4.  Among the major industrialised economies, Japan had seen the largest contraction in output. A number of other Asian economies had also released data showing particularly large falls in industrial production, output and trade flows.  Output was also estimated to have fallen sharply in the United States and the euro area in Q4.  The JPMorgan Global Purchasing Managers’ Index for manufacturing had risen slightly in February, but the Global Services Index had fallen.  In the United Kingdom, nominal GDP was estimated to have fallen by 0.8% in 2008 Q4, and was only 0.5% higher than its level a year earlier.  De-stocking was estimated to have made an even larger contribution to the 1.5% decline in real output than the Committee had anticipated, accounting for almost two thirds of the entire fall.  Output surveys continued to point to a broadly similar rate of contraction in output in the first quarter of 2009 to that in the fourth quarter of 2008.  But the evidence on de-stocking in Q4 provided some support for the Committee’s central projection in the February Report of a partial recovery in growth rates over 2009, as the negative contribution to growth from de-stocking lessened.   CPI inflation had fallen slightly, to 3% in January from 3.1% in December, much as the Committee had expected at the time of the February Report.  But it remained significantly above the 2% target. The Committee agreed that further monetary easing was required to meet the inflation target, and that was likely to require asset purchases as well as a further cut in Bank Rate. The Committee voted unanimously to reduce Bank Rate by  0.5 percentage points.  The Committee also voted unanimously in favour of the proposition that the Bank of England should seek to make £75 billion of asset purchases funded by the issuance of central bank reserves within the following three months.  The Committee noted that, insofar as purchases of private sector assets fell short of the £75 billion target, the Bank would buy medium and long-term gilts to fulfil the overall quantity of purchases. In the month leading up to the Committee’s meeting on  8–9 April, around £26.5 billion of assets had been purchased. Yields on those gilts with 5–25 years to maturity had fallen on the announcement.  Around the turn of the year there had been a deterioration in world trade of unprecedented magnitude and speed.  World output growth had also been weak, but the collapse in world trade appeared to be much more severe than its long-term average relationship with output implied.  Purchasing managers’ indices from a wide variety of economies were suggesting that the pace of deterioration in global output growth might be moderating.  In the United Kingdom, the monthly increase in the CIPS/Markit manufacturing output index had been the largest since the survey began in 1991 and the services index had risen for four months in a row.  Those indicators were still consistent with falling output.  But the steady slowing in the rate of contraction during 2009 implied by the central projection in the February Report seemed broadly on track.   CPI inflation had risen to 3.2% in February, higher than the Committee had expected.  Much of the upside news had been in CPI components that had a relatively high import content. It seemed likely that the increase largely reflected faster or greater-than-expected pass-through from the depreciation of sterling.  Despite the pickup in inflation in February, inflation still seemed likely to fall below target by the second half of the year, reflecting diminishing contributions from retail energy and food prices and rising spare capacity.  Labour cost growth had been very weak on the month:  settlements had fallen sharply, and there had been continued evidence of pay freezes. Overall, the risks to the domestic economy remained weighted to the downside.  But the initial effects of the Committee’s asset purchases had been encouraging.  The Committee voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%, and to continue with the asset purchase programme agreed at the March meeting. At its meeting on 6–7 May, the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%.  The Committee also voted to continue with its programme of asset purchases financed by the issue of central bank reserves and to increase its size by £50 billion to a total of £125 billion.  Section 1 Money and asset prices 11 want to borrow — Section 1.2 considers developments in the banking sector and corporate and household credit conditions. Section 1.3 looks at recent equity price and exchange rate movements.   Asset purchases and the gilt market Between 5 March and 7 May, the Bank made £51 billion of purchases of UK Government medium and longer-term gilts, funded by the issuance of central bank reserves (Chart 1.3).  As discussed below, the programme of purchases has depressed yields on gilts at eligible maturities.  That also put downward pressure on other interest rates, such as those on corporate bonds (Section 1.2).  In addition, the Bank purchased  £2.0 billion of commercial paper and £0.6 billion of corporate bonds — just over half of which was financed using central bank reserves.(1) The impact of these purchases of private sector debt, which are intended to ease corporate credit conditions more directly, is discussed in Section 1.2.  As discussed in the box on pages 16–17, asset purchases work in part because they increase the liquidity of some investors’ portfolios.  Investors who sell their assets find that their money holdings have increased.  To the extent that their holdings of money are then above their desired levels, they may buy other assets to rebalance their portfolios.   To monitor the impact of asset purchases through this channel, it is therefore necessary to monitor which investors have seen increases in the liquidity of their portfolios due to the Bank’s programme, and how, over time, they have reacted to that increased liquidity.  But it is not straightforward to identify those investors, as it is not necessarily the final seller of an asset to the Bank who ends up with increased liquidity. For example, some investors may have bought gilts in order to sell them to the Bank.  In that case, it would be those that they bought the gilts from whose liquidity would ultimately be affected by the Bank’s purchases.  With that caveat in mind, data on net sales of public sector debt show that the increase in the Bank’s holdings of public sector debt in March was accompanied by a fall in the gilt holdings of the UK  non-bank private sector and of overseas residents (Chart 1.4).   Looking ahead, sectoral balance sheet data may provide useful information on how investors are rebalancing their portfolios, but these data are currently available only to 2008 Q4.  As more data become available, changes in UK-based  non-bank financial companies’ portfolios will be of particular interest.  This sector, which includes insurance companies and pension funds, held more than half of UK eligible gilts at the end of 2008.  It is therefore likely that they will be the source of a significant proportion of the Bank’s eventual purchases.

Purchases of £125 billion are equivalent to some 8% of the stock of M4 excluding intermediate OFCs.  March’s purchases, the only ones to affect currently available money data, are equivalent to 1 percentage point on annual growth  in Q1.  Other factors will also influence money growth:   four-quarter growth in M4 excluding intermediate OFCs ticked up to 3.9% in Q1, from 3.5% in Q4. Gilt purchases are likely to raise the price of gilts, and so reduce their yields, regardless of who they are bought from (see the box on pages 16–17).  Gilt yields fell slightly following the release of the February Inflation Report, which discussed the APF and the possibility that it might be used to purchase government securities.(1) When the MPC’s initial programme of asset purchases was announced on 5 March, yields on eligible gilts (conventional gilts with maturities between  5 and 25 years) fell further (Chart 1.5).  Although gilt purchases are likely to have continued to bear down on yields, other factors have put some upward pressure on gilt yields over subsequent weeks.  For example, projections for Government borrowing were revised up by more than market participants expected in the Budget in April, contributing to an increase in expectations of bond issuance;  this may have raised yields. 1.2 Banks and credit conditions  Banks’ capital and funding  A concern throughout the financial crisis has been whether banks have adequate capital to absorb potential losses.  And as the economic outlook has worsened, the likely scale of losses has increased.  Indeed, banks have already seen an increase in losses on past loans to companies and households.  That reflects both a rise in the number of borrowers defaulting on loans, and a fall in the value of collateral against which those loans were secured as both commercial and residential property prices have fallen (Chart 1.6).  Banks have made provisions for further losses on lending.   The Government has taken steps to improve banks’ capital positions.(2) It has provided capital injections to some banks. And, under the Asset Protection Scheme (APS), it offered banks the option to buy insurance against severe losses on certain assets.  The Royal Bank of Scotland and the Lloyds Banking Group took up that insurance.   Banks have also been facing funding difficulties since the onset of the financial crisis.  Shorter-term funding conditions have become a little easier since the February Report — for example, three-month interbank lending rates have fallen back further Chart 1.6 Property prices 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 1996 98 2000 02 04 06 08 Indices:  peaks = 100 Commercial property prices(a) House prices(b) Sources:  Halifax, Investment Property Databank, Nationwide and Thomson Datastream.

Section 1 Money and asset prices 13 Broad money The quantity of money in the economy is closely linked to the medium-term path of nominal spending.  There are several alternative concepts of money, but the MPC seeks to monitor measures that are most closely related to nominal spending — that is, those based around the liquid assets of the sectors most likely to drive activity.  This box sets out the Bank’s thinking on an economically relevant measure of broad money, and recent trends in that relative to the headline M4 measure. Defining money Money is a good or asset which meets three requirements:  it serves as a unit of account;  it is a store of value;  and it is accepted as payment for goods and services.  A simple, but very narrow, measure of money is therefore the amount of notes and coin in circulation.  But as financial systems have developed, the relative importance of notes and coin has declined.  And broader measures of money, incorporating a wider range of assets such as bank deposits, have been developed.   Generally, measures of broad money aim to exclude money held by sectors which create money (ie institutions whose liabilities are used as a medium of exchange).  Only banks and building societies are money creators in the United Kingdom. So the UK M4 measure comprises the money holdings of households, non-financial companies, and those financial companies which are not banks or building societies (called ‘other financial corporations’ or OFCs).   In late 2007, the Bank of England set out a proposal to exclude the money holdings of some OFCs from UK M4.(1) A large part of the OFC sector is made up of institutions such as pension funds, whose money holdings are likely to influence asset prices and spending.  But other OFCs specialise in intermediating between banks;  for example, central clearing counterparties, which facilitate the settlement of securities transactions, and also securitisation special purpose vehicles (SPVs), which have been used by banks as a way to transfer risk off their own balance sheet.   It makes sense to exclude the deposits of these types of ‘intermediate OFCs’ from broad money.  In addition, headline M4 data have been affected by significant flows between institutions belonging to the same banking group.  A measure of broad money which excludes both intermediate OFCs, and estimates of intragroup transactions based on anecdotal information, is shown in Chart A.(2) Recent trends in broad money Between 2004 and 2007, M4 and M4 excluding intermediate OFCs both grew rapidly.  But since the onset of the financial crisis, the two measures have shown very divergent trends (Chart A).  That is because changes in market behaviour have led to sharp rises in the money holdings of intermediate OFCs. For example, SPVs previously sold securitised bonds to other non-banks in the United Kingdom.  But with no market for securitised assets, banks have instead retained securities issued by their SPVs.  In turn, SPVs have been holding the proceeds from this issuance on deposit.  That has boosted OFCs’ money holdings and, therefore, M4.  Excluding these, and other transactions which have artificially raised headline M4, growth has fallen sharply.   Since the present financial crisis began, growth in M4 excluding intermediate OFCs has fallen back markedly.  That has been broadly based across sectors (Chart B).  But, from March, the MPC’s asset purchases should begin to boost money growth (see the box on pages 16–17).

Market intelligence suggests that longer-term funding is still scarce, perhaps reflecting continuing concerns about banks’ capital.  But lenders have been more willing to supply funding if covered by a Government guarantee.  So both the Credit Guarantee Scheme, which has been in operation since the autumn, and the guarantee on the issuance of highly rated asset-backed securities launched in the Budget in April, should help ease overall funding pressures. Bank lending A key concern of the MPC has been the extent to which banking sector dislocation constrains companies and households.  To help monitor developments in lending, the Bank has been collecting more timely data from the largest UK lenders — referred to here as the ‘Lending Panel banks’.  In addition, the Bank has published a new monthly report,Trends in Lending, which brings together a range of data, surveys and intelligence.(1) This subsection uses that and other information to, first, discuss overall developments in bank lending, and subsequently to examine corporate and household credit conditions in more detail.  The dislocation in the financial sector has contributed to a sharp slowing in the rate of growth of lending to households and companies over the past 18 months.  As Charts 1.8 and 1.9 suggest, that has in part been because some foreign and smaller UK institutions, which had played a key role in the previous expansion of lending, have withdrawn from the market.  Growth in lending by the major UK banks has also slowed.  The slowing in lending growth may not only have been due to a reduced supply of credit — it could also reflect a fall in the demand for credit by companies and households, as the economy slowed and property prices fell. Lending growth remained weak at the start of 2009.  But there have been signs of a modest increase in willingness to lend by those institutions still active in UK markets.  In aggregate, respondents to the Bank’s Credit Conditions Survey in April reported an intention to increase the availability of corporate and secured household credit over the following three months. Government actions should provide some support to lending over the coming year.  In return for access to the APS, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group each made lending commitments.  And Northern Rock has been directed by the Government no longer actively to reduce its mortgage book. Separately, Barclays and HSBC have announced an intention to expand their net lending to businesses and households modestly over the coming year.  Section 5 discusses the risks around growth in the supply of credit.

Section 1 Money and asset prices 15 subsections look more closely at corporate and household credit conditions. Corporate credit conditions The tightening in corporate credit conditions over the past year has been a major concern to the authorities.  There have been some signs of improvement over the past three months, especially in corporate debt markets, but the weakness in bank lending indicates that overall conditions remain tight for many companies.  There is mixed evidence on the cost of bank borrowing for companies.  The average effective interest rates charged on new and outstanding loans have fallen, according to official data (Table 1.A), as Bank Rate has been reduced.  Taken at face value, that might imply a loosening in corporate credit conditions.  But rates may, in part, have fallen because only less risky customers, who therefore tend to be charged lower rates, are able to access finance — Lending Panel banks report that they have been targeting their lending at companies with good credit quality.  And the cost of borrowing also depends on any fees charged by the lender.  There are no official data on fees on corporate lending, but contacts of the Bank’s regional Agents report that a wide range of bank fees have been introduced or increased, and Lending Panel banks report higher fees on new borrowing facilities.  The amount of net bank lending to companies grew only weakly over the first three months of the year (Chart 1.8). That weakness in part reflects developments in the supply of finance.  But at the same time, the slowdown in economic activity has reduced demand for new loans.  Banks responding to recent Credit Conditions Surveys report fewer companies wanting to borrow to invest, consistent with evidence from business surveys (Section 2).   Of those companies that do wish to raise finance, however, some are able to bypass the banking sector and access capital markets directly.  Gross issuance of corporate bonds and commercial paper was relatively high in the first quarter (Chart 1.10), reflecting issuances by a range of  investment-grade companies.  Net issuance fell in the three months to March, largely on account of bond repayments by Network Rail.  Between September and February, net  issuance averaged a little over £2 billion a month, but that remained low relative to past bank lending flows, which averaged around £6 billion a month between 2005 and the middle of 2008.   The increased volume of gross issuance in recent months may in part reflect debt restructuring rather than finance for new projects — banks in the Lending Panel have reported that some companies are using the proceeds of bond issuance to pay down bank debt.  And the option of issuing bonds is currently open to only a small proportion of companies — no UK PNFC Chart 1.10 Debt issuance by UK PNFCs(a) 15 10 5 0 5 10 15 2005 06 07 08 09 Gross issuance Repayments Net issuance £ billions + – (a) Three-month average flows of sterling and foreign currency funds raised from corporate bond and commercial paper markets.

The objective of this policy is to boost the supply of money in the economy, ease conditions in corporate credit markets and, ultimately, to raise the rate of growth of nominal demand and keep inflation on track to meet the 2% target in the medium term.  The MPC is pursuing a twin-track approach by purchasing both government and high-quality corporate debt. This box discusses the impact of such asset purchases, some influences on their effectiveness, and the range of indicators the MPC is monitoring to judge their impact.     The impact of asset purchases Purchases of gilts and corporate debt financed by the issuance of central bank reserves influence nominal spending through a number of channels (Chart A).   Purchases of assets financed by central bank reserves  should push up the prices of assets and lower yields.  That boosts wealth and reduces the cost of borrowing for households and companies, both of which should boost their spending.  The Bank’s asset purchases can boost prices, and reduce yields, in a number of ways.  For example, when investors sell assets to the Bank, their money holdings increase.  If that leaves their holdings of money above their desired levels, they may buy other assets to rebalance their portfolios.  Moreover, to the extent that the Bank’s purchases depress yields on gilts and corporate debt relative to those on other assets, households and companies may respond to those lower yields by switching into assets with higher returns.  The higher demand for a wide range of assets that might result from these effects is likely to raise prices and reduce yields. Some investors, particularly those based overseas, may choose to invest the money in overseas rather than UK assets.  But to do that they would need to exchange their sterling holdings for foreign currency.  That would pass the money on to someone else, who may then decide to use it to buy sterling assets.  And selling sterling for foreign currency may put downward pressure on the exchange rate (Section 1.3). In addition, the purchases of corporate bonds and commercial paper should reduce the cost of borrowing for companies by improving the functioning of corporate debt markets.  The cost of borrowing in capital markets has been pushed up by elevated liquidity premia (Section 1.2), as low market activity has left potential investors concerned that they will be unable to find buyers for corporate debt if they need to sell quickly. The Bank’s offer to be a ready buyer, if required, should give investors greater confidence to hold such assets.   As well as their influence via prices, asset purchases financed by the issuance of central bank reserves increase commercial banks’ reserve balances at the Bank of England.  That increases the supply, and therefore reduces the cost, of liquidity.  As their stock of liquid assets increases, banks may be more willing to lend to companies and households.  More generally, as money balances rise, companies and households may increase their spending.  For example, some companies may currently be holding on to cash due to worries about their ability to access working capital.  Higher money balances may therefore encourage them to expand spending.      Finally, as with conventional monetary policy, expectations play a key role.  Without the stimulus from asset purchases, households and companies might have expected a protracted period of below-target inflation.  But the asset purchase programme means that the risk of that is diminished.  And, for a given level of nominal interest rates, the resulting increase in inflation expectations, by pushing down on real interest rates, may provide a further boost to spending and inflation. Expectations also influence the price-setting behaviour of companies, so could lead to a more direct impact on inflation.  Factors influencing the effectiveness of purchases Asset purchases should raise nominal spending and inflation over time, but a number of factors will determine the size and speed of that effect.   If the Bank buys assets from non-banks, it credits their account at a commercial bank.  Therefore asset purchases from  non-banks will lead directly to a rise in bank deposits.  But the ultimate impact on nominal spending depends on how investors subsequently rebalance their portfolios.  The impact is likely to be greater if investors switch into UK corporate bonds or equities, boosting demand for those assets and raising their price.  On the other hand, the impact will be smaller if sellers leave the cash on deposit.   Another factor influencing the effectiveness of purchases is the extent to which banks choose to hoard the extra liquidity, or increase lending.  That may depend on the form the new bank deposits take — for example, banks may be less willing to increase lending if deposits are placed with them in very  short-term accounts.  Banks are also less likely to expand lending if they remain capital constrained.  Section 1.2 discusses banking sector developments.     Finally, as with any economic policy, households’ and companies’ decisions will affect the efficacy of asset purchases. It is possible that households and companies may not wish to spend out of higher wealth, if they are aiming to rebuild their  Section 1 Money and asset prices 17 balance sheets.  Or their demand for credit may remain subdued, so that lending does not rise even if banks are more willing to extend credit.    Assessing the impact of purchases As with changes in Bank Rate, it will take time to assess the extent to which the MPC’s asset purchases have stimulated nominal spending.  The first leg of the transmission mechanism is the resulting changes in yields and asset prices, and the Asset Purchase Facility does appear to have borne down on gilt yields (Section 1.1).  Further asset price impacts may occur as the Bank makes further purchases, investors rebalance their portfolios, and market participants assess the impact of purchases on the outlook for the UK economy.  But it will continue to be difficult to isolate the impact of the APF. To the extent that assets are bought from non-banks, measures of the broad money stock will rise.  But it will take time for this effect to become visible in the data.  The purchases in March — the latest month for which broad money data are available — amount to around 1% of M4 excluding intermediate OFCs.  The box on page 13 examines some issues around the measurement of money.   A key aspect of the policy is to ease credit conditions, especially those facing companies.  The purchases of corporate debt are designed to improve the functioning of those markets, and so this impact needs to be judged by developments in those markets, not by the size of the stock of purchased assets. The MPC will continue to monitor the cost of corporate borrowing, and in particular evidence whether the liquidity premium on corporate debt is declining.  The extent to which the corporate sector as a whole is credit constrained will continue to be assessed using survey evidence and intelligence from the banks, the Bank’s regional Agents, and financial market participants.  Section 1.2 examines evidence on recent developments in credit.  The MPC will also continue to pay close attention to measures of inflation expectations, and in particular whether expectations in the medium term remain consistent with the 2% inflation target.  Section 4 describes recent movements in measures of inflation expectations. Finally, the MPC will be monitoring developments in nominal demand growth closely.  But it will be many months before the policy stimulus would be likely to appear in published estimates of final expenditure.

The cost of borrowing in capital markets provides another indicator of corporate credit conditions.  Although companies issuing bonds generally have to offer a higher yield than those on government bonds of the same maturity, the difference between these corporate and government yields rose over 2008 (Chart 1.11).  That rise in corporate bond spreads in part reflected the need for greater compensation for the risk of default as the economy slowed.  But, on top of that, reduced activity in bond markets since the onset of the financial crisis increased the compensation demanded by buyers against the possibility that it might be difficult to sell those bonds on in the future.  In other words, liquidity premia rose.   18 Inflation Report  May 2009 Table 1.B Lending to individuals Annualised percentage changes on three months earlier Averages(a) 2009 1998 to  2007 2008 Jan.

The Bank’s willingness, under the APF, to be a ready buyer of  high-quality corporate bonds is intended to reduce such liquidity premia (see the box on pages 16–17).  It is difficult to measure this component of bond spreads precisely and there is no consistent evidence on whether premia have fallen back. But market contacts suggest that the APF has improved market conditions.  And average industrial investment-grade corporate bond spreads have fallen since the February Report. That fall in spreads, together with the fall in UK government bond yields, has reduced investment-grade corporate bond yields (Chart 1.11).   Under the APF the Bank has also purchased commercial paper — short-term debt which is used by some companies to finance day-to-day operations.  This market is relatively small and there are few data against which to assess the impact of the Bank’s purchases.  But data on primary market transactions suggest spreads for A1-rated issuers narrowed over 2009 Q1. Net issuance of sterling non-bank commercial paper increased slightly over the quarter for lower-rated companies, and market contacts expected the level of issuance to increase further. A widely used form of short-term finance for companies is trade credit — the ability to delay payment for goods and services received.  Most companies will extend credit as a supplier and receive it as a buyer.  Since the autumn, the Bank’s regional Agents have reported that some suppliers have been asking their creditors to settle invoices more quickly. Although that helps ease cash-flow constraints for suppliers, it imposes a cost on their trading partners.  Moreover, some companies have noted a tightening in conditions on trade credit related products.  There are a range of products available to help companies manage the risks associated with extending credit — companies can sell on their invoices, borrow against them, or take out insurance against non-payment.(1) The costs of providing such products has been pushed up by both the increased likelihood that a trading partner will default on their payment and developments in the banking sector.  The cost and availability of trade credit insurance remains a particular concern for contacts of the Bank’s regional Agents.  The Government outlined a scheme in the Budget in April to top up insurance cover for UK companies temporarily if they have had their private sector cover reduced.  That may help to ease this constraint. Household credit conditions and the housing market Overall, household lending growth remained very weak in 2009 Q1 (Table 1.B).  Within that, consumer credit grew at its weakest quarterly rate since 1992, consistent with weakness in consumer spending (Section 2).  And the stock of secured lending, which comprises the majority of household debt, grew (1) See the box on page 15 of the February 2009 Report.

For example, the sharp narrowing in the spread on 31 March largely reflects such a change. (b) Option-adjusted spread over government bonds.  Section 1 Money and asset prices 19 by only 1% on an annualised basis over the same period, substantially below rates seen earlier in the decade. The supply of secured lending has tightened since the onset of the financial crisis.  That has been reflected in a sharp rise in the spread lenders charge borrowers over Bank Rate or swap rates.  The tightening has been most marked for customers who are perceived to be more risky.  For example, there has been a significant fall in the number of products available at high loan to value ratios.  In part, that is due to the departure from the market of lenders which previously specialised in riskier lending.   In addition to the tightening in supply, demand for secured borrowing also fell, as the economy slowed and some potential homebuyers stayed out of the market in anticipation of further house price falls.  Given both tighter supply and Iower demand, the number of loans approved for house purchase fell to a low of 27,000 in November 2008, well below the average of 95,000 approvals a month over the past fifteen years. But there have been some signs of a modest improvement in housing market activity.  The number of loan approvals for house purchase, while still well below average, picked up to 39,000 in March.  And the recent rise in the number of people looking for property, as reported by estate agents responding to the RICS survey, is likely to feed through to further rises in approvals in coming months, if those potential buyers can access finance (Chart 1.12).  This modest recovery in activity could in part reflect lower borrowing costs.  The large falls in Bank Rate and swap rates since September 2008 have more than offset rising spreads so that quoted mortgage rates have fallen (Chart 1.13). House prices continued to fall in April, by 1% based on the average of the Halifax and Nationwide measures (Chart 1.6). The monthly falls in 2009, however, have been smaller than those seen towards the end of 2008.   1.3 Equity prices and exchange rates Equity prices In the period since the February Report, equity prices first fell sharply, before recovering from early March.  In the fifteen working days to 6 May, the FTSE All-Share was 1.9% above its level at the time of the February Report, and 19% above its March low.  But equity prices remain substantially lower than at the start of 2008. Movements in UK equity prices have mirrored those seen in other countries (Chart 1.14).  Indeed, over the past year, global equity prices have been closely correlated, perhaps reflecting the synchronised nature of the economic slowdown  (Section 2).

Exchange rates In the fifteen working days to 6 May, the sterling effective exchange rate (ERI) was 3.3% above its February starting point (Chart 1.15).  As discussed in the box on pages 16–17, the Bank’s asset purchases are likely to lead investors to buy other assets to rebalance their portfolios.  That could include purchases of overseas assets if, for example, overseas assets are viewed as substitutes for those assets bought by the Bank. That could put some downward pressure on the exchange rate. It is difficult, however, to isolate any impact to date. Despite the appreciation over the past three months, the sterling ERI remains around a quarter below its 2007 peak.  As discussed in the February Report, changes in relative interest rates in the United Kingdom and abroad can explain only some of the fall since 2007.  A further part may reflect a reduction in market participants’ view of the longer-term value of sterling — respondents to Consensus surveys revised down their view of the likely level of the exchange rate at the end of 2013 by around 6% between October 2008 and February 2009  (Chart 1.16).  In addition, some of the depreciation is likely to reflect a rise in the sterling risk premium.  That could be because investors believe that the risks to the UK outlook — and therefore to the return on UK assets — have increased, relative to those in other economies.  An increase in the perceived risk associated with holding sterling assets relative to those denominated in other currencies means that investors will tend to require a higher return.   The lower exchange rate has raised UK inflation (Section 4), but it should also mitigate the impact of the slowdown in global demand on UK activity (Section 2).  The MPC’s assessment of the risks to inflation from the sterling exchange rate is discussed in Section 5.

Official data and business surveys suggest that GDP contracted markedly in Q1 in many advanced economies, following the widespread falls in output in 2008 Q4.  The weakness in global activity in Q4 and Q1 has been accompanied by a very sharp decline in world trade (Chart 2.1), discussed in the box on pages 22–23. In the United Kingdom, nominal GDP fell by 1% in Q4, the largest quarterly decline since 1974.  Real GDP fell by 1.6% in the fourth quarter, and is provisionally estimated to have fallen by a further 1.9% in 2009 Q1.  Consumer spending and business investment both declined in Q4, and are likely to remain weak in the near term (Section 2.2).  But the weakness of GDP growth in Q4 was significantly amplified by companies reducing stocks, and that drag is likely to dissipate over coming quarters (see the box on page 26). 2.1 External demand and UK trade There was a sharp slowdown in global demand growth in 2008 Q4.  The IMF estimate that world GDP fell by around 1.6% in the fourth quarter.  And official data and business surveys indicate that activity continued to fall sharply in the United Kingdom’s major trading partners in 2009 Q1.  In the euro area — the destination for around half of the United Kingdom’s exports — business surveys point to a further marked contraction in GDP in Q1 following the 1.6% decline in 2008 Q4.  And in the United States, output fell by 1.6% in 2009 Q1.  GDP is also likely to have fallen in many other countries over the past two quarters:  the OECD expect more than four fifths of its 30 member countries to have been in recession in 2009 Q1. In recent months, there have been some signs that the pace of contraction in global activity may be moderating.  Survey indicators of global output have picked up from their troughs 2 Demand The sharp and synchronised fall in global economic activity continued in the early months of 2009. That was accompanied by a plunge in world trade flows.  In the United Kingdom, real GDP is provisionally estimated to have fallen by 1.9% in Q1, following a fall of 1.6% in 2008 Q4.  Consumer spending has fallen, reflecting heightened uncertainty, rising unemployment, tight credit conditions and lower financial wealth.  Business and dwellings investment have also declined, and near-term indicators point to further falls.  The slowdown in activity has been significantly amplified by companies running down stocks.

World trade is estimated to have fallen by around 7% in 2008 Q4.  In part, that decline reflected a marked contraction in world output:  the IMF estimates that world GDP fell by around 1.6% in 2008 Q4.  Trade flows tend to be more volatile than output.  But the plunge in world trade still looks large even taking the past relationship between activity and trade into account.  This box considers the causes of the fall in world trade, and their implications for UK activity. Causes of the fall in world trade One factor underlying the collapse in world trade flows is that, during the current downturn, the more trade-intensive elements of demand have been most affected.  For example, demand for items such as capital goods, motor vehicles and other consumer durables appears to have fallen particularly markedly across a range of countries (Section 2.1). Correspondingly, global output of manufactured goods has weakened significantly (Chart A).  That contraction in manufacturing output may also have been exacerbated by the desire of manufacturing companies to run down stocks (see the box on page 26). The volume of world trade is likely to be particularly sensitive to changes in output in the manufacturing sector.  Not only are finished manufactured goods highly traded, but different stages of production are often carried out in different countries (a phenomenon sometimes referred to as ‘globalisation of supply chains’).  This means that during the production of a single good, its components can cross national borders many times, with production processes in each country adding just a small part to the overall value of the good.  Trade flows are measured as the full value of an item as it crosses national borders, while GDP is measured only by the value that is added to an item within each country.  So in the presence of globalised supply chains, a change in the demand for manufactured goods will have a disproportionately large impact on world trade flows, relative to its impact on global GDP. In addition to the downturn in demand for highly traded manufactured goods, and the falls in trade flows resulting from the disruption of globalised supply chains, a reduction in the supply of credit used to facilitate international trade may also have exacerbated the decline in trade flows.(1) Limited data are available on the supply of such trade finance, so it is difficult to assess the extent to which reduced access to trade credit has pushed down on world trade.  A survey of banks carried out in March 2009 by the Bankers’ Association for Finance and Trade and the IMF reported that the decline in the value of trade finance business accelerated between October 2008 and January 2009 across a range of countries, and that around 60% of banks cited reduced credit availability as a reason for that decline.  The G20 has moved to address this issue by making available $250 billion of support for trade finance over the next two years. It is difficult to judge the relative importance of these explanations for the decline in world trade, and it is likely that each of them has played some role.  But the sharpness of the falls in manufacturing output suggests that a marked decline in the demand for highly traded manufactured goods, whose production processes span a number of countries, has been particularly influential. Implications of the fall in world trade for UK activity The sharp slowdown in the demand for highly traded manufactured items has weighed on UK goods exports, which fell by 6.9% in Q4.  The outlook for these exports will partly depend on the severity and persistence of the slowdown in the global demand for traded goods.  The latest data suggest that the pace of contraction eased in the early part of 2009.  World trade in goods is estimated to have grown by 0.8% in February, following declines of around 6% in each of the previous three months. The outlook for overall UK export growth will also depend on exports of services, which make up around 40% of UK exports. In Q4, exports of services grew by 1.1%.  That meant that the total fall in UK exports in Q4 was much smaller than the declines in many countries that are more specialised in the production of manufactured goods (Chart B).  Some of the growth in UK services exports in Q4 reflected increased exports of financial services.  That is somewhat puzzling, given the ongoing dislocation in the UK financial sector.  So while services exports may help to cushion the impact of the large decline in world trade on UK activity, some of the recent strength of services exports may prove short-lived.

(a) Volume measures.  Section 2 Demand 23 in late 2008, particularly in the manufacturing sector (Chart 2.2).  Nonetheless, the weakness of the incoming data has led to further downward revisions to forecasts for global activity since the February Report.  The IMF, for example, now forecast a contraction in world GDP in 2009 of 1.3% (Chart 2.3).  If that were realised, the current downturn would be by far the deepest global recession during the post-war period. Underlying the sharp and synchronous downturn in global demand has been a deterioration in consumer and business sentiment, and a tightening in credit conditions.  Those factors caused consumers to reduce spending, particularly on durable goods:  for example, car sales have fallen sharply in both the United States and the euro area.  And orders for capital goods have plummeted as companies have cut back on investment spending (Table 2.A). The substantial macroeconomic stimulus implemented by governments and central banks around the world will in due course help to lessen the scale of the downturn.  Discretionary fiscal injections have been announced in a number of countries, in addition to the automatic stimulus from Some of the impact of the sharp fall in world trade on overall UK GDP is also likely to be offset by lower import growth. Where UK exporters are part of global supply chains, lower exports will lead to falls in imports of part-finished goods or components.  So the headline fall in world trade would overstate the likely impact on UK output.  In Q4, net trade made a positive contribution to UK GDP growth (Chart C) despite the sharp decline in world trade. Overall, the sharp drop in world trade has pushed down markedly on UK exports.  But to the extent that the contraction has been focused on the manufacturing sector, falls in UK exports may be less severe than in many other countries.  And lower imports may partly offset weaker exports.  Net trade may be further supported by the impact of the sterling exchange rate, which has fallen by around a quarter since mid-2007.  The implications of the decline in world trade for UK activity in the medium term are discussed in Section 5.

Interest rates have been cut, and, in some countries, additional monetary policy measures have been introduced to boost the supply of money and credit, and hence nominal spending. The sharp falls in global demand have been accompanied by a very marked contraction in world trade (Chart 2.1).  The sharp decline in demand for manufactured goods (Table 2.A), which are relatively highly traded, is likely to have been an important factor underlying the decline in world trade.  In addition, a reduction in the supply of credit used to facilitate international trade may have exacerbated the slowdown in trade flows.  The box on pages 22–23 discusses these issues in more detail. The global slowdown has weighed heavily on the demand for UK exports, which fell by 3.7% in Q4.  But that fall was smaller than the decline in world trade (Chart 2.4), resulting in a pickup in the United Kingdom’s share of world exports.  The relatively small fall in UK exports partly reflects the smaller proportion of manufactured goods in total UK exports compared with other countries.  Furthermore, it is likely that the downward pressure on export growth from the decline in world trade is being partly offset by the boost to competitiveness arising from the decline in the sterling exchange rate, which has fallen by around a quarter since mid-2007. UK import volumes fell more sharply than exports in Q4.  As a result, net trade contributed 0.7 percentage points to GDP growth.  The weakness of imports suggests that the fall in sterling, and the associated rise in the relative price of imports, has encouraged UK households and businesses to purchase domestically produced goods and services rather than imports. Indeed, import penetration — the ratio of imports to total final expenditure — has fallen by around 5% from its peak in 2007 Q3.  The low level of sterling, combined with the weak outlook for domestic demand, is likely to continue to put downward pressure on imports in the near term. 2.2 Domestic demand Nominal GDP fell by 1% in 2008 Q4 (Chart 2.5), the largest quarterly decline since 1974.  Weakness in nominal spending growth has coincided with a sharp slowing in money growth (Section 1).  The low level of Bank Rate and the MPC’s programme of asset purchases (see the box on pages 16–17) will act to boost nominal spending over time, but it is too early to assess the full impact of these measures. Real GDP fell by 1.6% in Q4, partly reflecting a fall in final domestic demand.  But the fall in GDP was amplified by a large negative contribution from stockbuilding (Table 2.B).  The weakness of domestic demand, including the contribution from stocks, was partly offset by the boost from net trade.

Inventories The fall in the level of stocks in Q4 was the largest since quarterly records began in 1955 (Chart 2.6).  De-stocking therefore accounted for around three quarters of the fall in GDP in Q4 (Table 2.B).  This sharp de-stocking, discussed in more detail in the box on page 26, is likely to partly reflect the weakness of demand prospects, and therefore a reduction in companies’ desired levels of stocks.  But it also suggests that companies may be adjusting to the lower level of demand more quickly in this recession compared with previous slowdowns, perhaps because of improvements in stock management techniques.  The MPC judges that the recent drag on growth from de-stocking is likely to ease over coming quarters. Consumer spending Consumer spending fell by 1% in Q4, the largest quarterly decline since 1980.  A fall in spending on consumer services, such as on restaurants and hotels, accounted for much of that fall (Chart 2.7).  Falling vehicle sales weighed on consumption for the third consecutive quarter.  And consumer spending in Q4 was reduced further by net tourism, largely reflecting lower spending by UK residents abroad.  But that reduction in spending abroad does not affect overall GDP, since it will have led to an equal reduction in imports. The latest indicators of household spending suggest that consumption continued to fall in Q1.  There are few indicators of spending on consumer services, but the sharp fall in private sector services output in Q1 (Section 3) points to a further contraction in this component of consumption.  Spending on retail goods looks to have held up better:  the ONS estimates that retail sales volumes rose by 0.9% in 2009 Q1, following growth of 0.7% in Q4.  But recent estimates of retail sales growth are likely to be revised down somewhat in the coming months, when the ONS updates the weights underlying the retail sales index. A key determinant of consumer spending is household income growth.  Real post-tax labour income rose by 1.3% in Q4, above its average rate of quarterly growth over the past decade of 0.7%.  That strength partly reflected a boost from lower commodity prices.  But income growth is likely to weaken in the near term, driven by lower earnings growth and falls in employment (Section 3). A second key influence on spending is the extent to which households increase the proportion of their income that they save.  The household saving rate picked up during 2008 (Chart 2.8).  Increased uncertainty about job prospects, and the economic outlook more generally — as indicated by the sharp fall in the GfK measure of consumer confidence during Chart 2.6 Whole-economy stock level(a) 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 1956 66 76 86 96 2006 Percentage change on a quarter earlier + – (a) Based on the level of stocks in 2007 Q4 and stockbuilding, excluding the alignment adjustment.

Chart 2.7 Contributions to quarterly growth in consumer spending(a)  26 Inflation Report  May 2009 The implications of the recent fall in stocks for the near-term growth outlook The level of companies’ stocks is estimated to have fallen by 2.1% in 2008 Q4.  If unrevised, that would be the largest decline since quarterly records began in 1955.  De-stocking accounted for around three quarters of the 1.6% fall in overall GDP in 2008 Q4.  This box considers the factors behind this de-stocking and the associated implications for the near-term growth outlook. Recent trends in stockbuilding Stockbuilding occurs when a business puts finished goods or raw materials to one side to hold in reserve, or when the volume of work in progress increases.  Changes in companies’ stock levels can result from unexpected fluctuations in demand.  But they may also reflect companies choosing to hold a different level of stocks.  Companies take a number of factors into account when planning what volume of stocks to hold.  Those include their expectations of future demand, and also the cost of holding stocks.(1) Stockbuilding data need to be interpreted with care, since quarterly estimates of this component of GDP are prone to large revisions.  But the ONS data chime with survey evidence that businesses cut back on stocks in Q4.  Those surveys, and reports from the Bank’s regional Agents, suggest that de-stocking continued in Q1. In the light of the sharp de-stocking in Q4, the Bank’s regional Agents have focused their discussions with companies more closely on inventories in recent months.  The majority of their contacts reported that they had lowered their planned stock levels, with falls in current and expected sales the main factors behind that change.  Many contacts also reported that concerns about the cost and availability of finance for working capital were an additional factor underlying the fall in their planned stockholdings. Implications for the near-term growth outlook The evidence from previous recessions suggests that stock cycles tend to amplify the slowdown in GDP growth initially, and then contribute to the turnaround in output growth later on (Chart A).  Arithmetically, de-stocking only reduces GDP growth if the fall in stock levels is larger than the fall in the previous period.  So although stocks may have declined for a number of quarters during previous recessions, the impact on GDP growth has tended to be particularly pronounced in the early stages of downturns, as companies began to de-stock.  In the 1990s recession for example, stockbuilding accounted for around one half of the falls in GDP growth in the first six months of falling output, before that drag eased as the pace of de-stocking stabilised. The scale of the de-stocking in 2008 Q4 suggests that companies may be adjusting to the lower level of demand particularly quickly.  Other things being equal, that could point to a shorter and sharper stock cycle in this recession compared with those in the early 1980s and early 1990s, when stock levels continued to fall for two years or more.  A shorter stock cycle may reflect improvements in stock management techniques.  For example, the introduction of just-in-time production, and the greater use of information technology to manage stocks, allows companies to respond more quickly to fluctuations in demand. De-stocking in Q4 also reflected the weakness of demand prospects, and the tightness of credit conditions.  So the scale of the fall in stock levels may suggest that companies are particularly pessimistic about future demand, or that tight credit conditions have forced companies to run down stocks to maximise cash flow.  To the extent that the large fall in stocks reflected those factors, that could point to downside risks to investment, employment and hence GDP growth in the near term. Overall, the size of the fall in stock levels is likely to reflect both the weakness of demand prospects, and a more rapid adjustment by companies to the lower level of demand.  The majority of the Agents’ contacts reported that they expected to be able to return stocks to desired levels within the next year.  The MPC judges that the drag from stockbuilding on GDP growth is likely to ease during 2009.

Section 2 Demand 27 2008 — is one factor that is likely to have encouraged households to increase savings.  This measure of confidence picked up in the early months of 2009, but remained at a historically low level. In addition, some households may have saved more in response to the significant falls in their financial wealth. Households’ net financial wealth fell by 17% in the year to 2008 Q4. The aggregate household saving rate may also have risen due to some households reducing their borrowing as the supply of credit has tightened.  The effect of this tightening has been amplified by the weakness of the housing market, which has reduced the amount of housing equity against which homeowners can borrow.  The latest Credit Conditions Survey pointed to a further reduction in the availability of secured credit to households in the three months to mid-March, although lenders expected credit availability to improve over the coming months (Section 1). Looking ahead, there would also be upward pressure on saving if households became more pessimistic about their income prospects in the medium to long term.  For example, in the April Budget the Government revised up its projection for public sector net borrowing.  That could cause saving to rise, if households expected the increased level of public sector borrowing to lead to higher taxes, and so to lower post-tax incomes, in the future. But offsetting these factors that might increase saving, the substantial monetary stimulus implemented since September should encourage households to spend rather than save.  The lower level of Bank Rate has reduced the debt-servicing costs faced by many households and should, in aggregate, boost household spending, given the likely higher propensity to consume from current income of borrowers, relative to savers. And both the low level of Bank Rate and the recently announced programme of asset purchases may raise household wealth, and hence spending, through their impact on asset prices.  In addition, lower Bank Rate will encourage households to bring forward some spending. Although the low level of Bank Rate has reduced the interest payments of many borrowers, arrears and repossessions picked up during 2008 (Table 2.C), and are likely to rise further in the near term as unemployment rises.  But so far, mortgage arrears and repossessions remain at lower levels than in the early 1990s, partly reflecting the fact that official interest rates increased sharply in the late 1980s, and remained at over 10% throughout 1991. Weighing up these influences on household spending, the MPC judges that consumer spending is likely to continue to fall in the near term.  And a key risk to the medium-term outlook for Chart 2.8 Household saving ratio(a) 5 0 5 10 15 1986 89 92 95 98 2001 04 07 Per cent  + – (a) Percentage of households’ total post-tax income.

Investment Investment was a significant drag on GDP growth during 2008, falling by 8% in the year to Q4.  A sharp contraction in those elements of investment related to the residential housing market can account for almost three quarters of that decline (Chart 2.9).  Some measures of housing market activity have risen somewhat in recent months, but indicators of new home building, such as housing starts, suggest that housing-related investment is likely to continue to fall during 2009. Business investment growth remained weak in Q4.  That reflected a further slowdown in both investment in buildings and in spending on plant and machinery.  The outlook for both of these components of business investment remains very subdued.  Construction orders for new commercial property fell by 36% in the three months to February compared with the previous three months.  And although forward-looking surveys of investment in plant and machinery stabilised in Q1, they remained at historically low levels (Chart 2.10). Two factors continue to underlie the weakness of business investment, according to contacts of the Bank’s regional Agents.  First, and most importantly, the worsening outlook for demand since Autumn 2008, combined with the high level of uncertainty about the depth and persistence of the slowdown, has led businesses to cut back or defer their capital spending. Second, the reduced availability of finance has weighed on investment plans:  consistent with that, the proportion of respondents to the CBI surveys of the manufacturing and service sector who cited the availability of finance as a constraint on their investment plans remained at a historically high level in Q1. Government spending The Government set out its latest fiscal plans in the April Budget.  The projection for public sector net borrowing was revised up substantially compared with the 2008 Pre-Budget Report (Table 2.D), reflecting both a stronger projection for government spending and a weaker projection for government receipts.  Those revisions partly reflected the weaker outlook for nominal GDP, which raises some components of government spending, such as social security benefits, and pushes down on tax receipts.  But even after adjusting for the economic cycle, net borrowing was revised up.  The Government also announced some modest discretionary measures to support demand in the near term.  Overall, public sector net borrowing as a share of nominal GDP was projected to peak at 12.4% in fiscal year 2009/10, before falling back. 10 5 0 5 10 15 2006 07 08 Government investment (13%) Business investment (65%) Housing-related investment(b) (23%) Gross ﬁxed capital formation (per cent) Percentage points  + – (a) Chained-volume measures.

Business surveys suggest that output will have fallen further in 2009 Q2, but that the pace of contraction will have moderated.  Recent declines in output have meant that a substantial degree of spare capacity has developed.  Labour market indicators remained weak:  unemployment continued to rise sharply and survey measures of employment intentions point to further falls in employment.  3 Output and supply The outlook for inflation is influenced by the degree of slack in the economy.  The marked falls in output since mid-2008 (Section 3.1) have meant that companies have worked their inputs less intensively, and so the degree of spare capacity within companies has increased (Section 3.2).  In addition, employment has fallen, leading to a further loosening in the labour market (Section 3.3).  Looking ahead, the amount of slack in the economy will depend on the persistence and depth of the recession, and also the extent to which the downturn impairs the economy’s supply capacity.       3.1 Output According to the latest official data, output fell by 1.9% in 2009 Q1, a larger decline than anticipated at the time of the February Report. This sharp contraction followed a decline of 1.6% in 2008 Q4 (Chart 3.1).  Taken together, this represents the largest six-month fall in output since quarterly records began in 1955.   The manufacturing sector has contracted by around 14% over the past year.  The fall in UK manufacturing output in part reflected lower demand for manufactured goods, both in the United Kingdom and abroad (see the box on pages 22–23 ). Manufacturers have responded to that weaker demand by cutting output even more sharply than the fall in demand, and so running down stocks.  The drag on manufacturing output growth from de-stocking is likely to ease over the coming quarters (see the box on page 26).   Service sector output has contracted by more than 2% over the past year, and fell by 1.2% in 2009 Q1 alone.  That meant that the service sector accounted for around half of the fall in overall output in Q1 (Chart 3.1).  The fall in services output over the quarter was broadly based across private sector services. Business surveys provide a timely indication of output growth.

Chart 3.2 CIPS/Markit indicators of output growth(a)  30 Inflation Report  May 2009 pointed to further falls in output in 2009 Q2.  But the indices have picked up from their troughs, suggesting a more moderate pace of decline than in 2009 Q1 (Chart 3.2).   3.2 Capacity utilisation  The weakness in output has led to a considerable increase in spare capacity within businesses (Chart 3.3).  That would typically be expected to put downward pressure on prices. And if companies expect spare capacity to persist, then they are also likely to respond by cutting investment (Section 2) and employment (Section 3.3). The extent to which spare capacity rises when output growth is weak depends on developments in companies’ potential supply capacity.  In particular, any associated moderation in potential supply growth will mean a smaller increase in spare capacity.  The remainder of Section 3.2 considers factors affecting companies’ supply capacity.  Supply effects that operate through the labour market are discussed in  Section 3.3.    One factor restricting some companies’ supply capacity is access to credit.  Bank lending to the corporate sector slowed sharply over 2008 (Section 1).  In addition, credit extended by one company to another, known as trade credit, is likely to have become harder to obtain for some companies.  Contacts of the Bank’s regional Agents cite the cost and availability of trade credit insurance as a significant burden.(1) And business surveys suggest that an increasing proportion of companies faced constraints on production due to difficulties accessing credit.  For example, the CBI Industrial Trends Survey shows a sharp rise in the proportion of manufacturing companies reporting that credit or finance is a constraint on output (Chart 3.4).  For these companies, tight credit conditions will limit output.  But it will not lead to reduced pricing pressures, as there will be little incentive to reduce prices to attract additional demand. Potential supply may also be reduced by an increase in corporate bankruptcies.  Some of the capital from insolvent companies is likely to be scrapped.  Consequently, any rise in insolvencies is likely to lead to a reduction in the economy’s capital stock and its supply capacity.  Since the end of 2007, there has been a marked increase in the number of corporate liquidations (Chart 3.5).  Despite this, the number of liquidations remains below its 1990s’ peak.  The liquidation rate — the number of liquidations as a proportion of the total number of companies — was even further below its 1990s’ highs, reflecting the rapid growth in the number of active companies.  But a further rise in the liquidation rate is likely in coming quarters, and this will weigh on supply capacity. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 1980 84 88 92 96 2000 04 08 Per cent Limiting effect of external ﬁnance   on capital expenditure(b)  Limiting effect of credit or ﬁnance   on output(a)   Source:  CBI.

Chart 3.3 Measures of capacity utilisation and  four-quarter output growth  (1) For more details on trade credit, see the box on page 15 of the February 2009 Report.  Section 3 Output and supply 31 Potential supply growth will also be reduced by companies cutting back on investment.  Companies have reduced investment spending as demand has slowed and uncertainty about the outlook has increased.  In addition, some businesses have reported that difficulties in raising external finance have constrained their capital expenditure (as Chart 3.4 shows for manufacturing companies).  But annual business investment flows are small relative to the size of the non-residential capital stock.  So a sustained period of weak business investment would be needed for the capital stock to decrease materially.   3.3 Labour market developments Since the February Report, most labour market indicators have weakened further.  This section considers companies’ demand for labour, labour supply, and labour market tightness. Companies’ demand for labour Following the recent sharp falls in output, companies’ demand for labour has fallen, and unemployment has risen sharply  on both the LFS and claimant count measures.  LFS unemployment increased by 177,000 in the three months to February.  And the more timely claimant count measure rose by 74,000 in March. The increase in claimant unemployment has been driven by a sharp increase in flows into unemployment, rather than reduced flows out of unemployment (Chart 3.6).  Rising inflows have been driven in part by rising job losses. Consistent with that, redundancies rose in the three months to February.  In addition, if new entrants to the labour force, from education for example, have been unable to find a job, that would also push up on inflows. Employment has continued to fall on both the LFS and Workforce Jobs measures (Chart 3.7).  LFS employment fell sharply in the three months to February compared with the three months to November.  Business surveys of employment intentions suggest further marked falls in employment in the near term.   Looking further ahead, the prospects for employment are uncertain.  In the recessions of the 1980s and 1990s, employment continued to fall even after output had started to grow again (Chart 3.8).  But the structure of the labour market is likely to have changed since then, and so these recessions may not give a good guide to developments in this episode.   It is possible that companies are more able to reduce labour costs by adjusting wages than was the case in the past.  This might mean that employment will fall by less than would otherwise have been the case.  Recent developments in pay growth are discussed in Section 4.  Practices such as  short-term working could also help reduce pressure on costs, 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 1989 93 97 2001 05 09 Thousands Inﬂows Outﬂows 0 Chart 3.6 Flows into and out of claimant unemployment 200 150 100 50 0 50 100 150 200 2005 06 07 08 09 Changes on previous quarter (thousands) Workforce Jobs(b) LFS + – Source:  ONS (including Labour Force Survey).

Chart 3.8 GDP and employment(a)  32 Inflation Report  May 2009 and support employment.  LFS data point to a relatively small reduction in average hours worked over the past year, but reports from the Bank’s regional Agents suggest that cutting hours has played an important role in controlling costs for some companies.  But some features of the current episode could act to increase the pickup in unemployment, offsetting the factors described above.  Tight credit conditions could make it more difficult  for companies to retain workers during the downturn, leading to a larger fall in employment.  In addition, businesses that import a high proportion of their inputs are likely to face significant cost pressures as a result of the exchange rate depreciation since mid-2007.  This could also push down on employment, if wages do not adjust sufficiently.  Influences on wages, including the exchange rate, are discussed in Section 4. Labour supply Rising unemployment is likely to put downward pressure on wages.  But the outlook for wages will also be affected by developments in the supply of labour provided by households. During periods of rising unemployment, labour supply may moderate if, for example, individuals perceive their prospects of finding work to be low and so stop searching.  In the current recession, labour supply growth has so far remained relatively strong.  That contrasts with the 1990s recession, during which labour supply declined markedly (Chart 3.9).   There are a number of potential explanations for the current resilience of labour supply.  First, the downturn may have heightened households’ concern over their debt position.  The participation rate for the 35–49 year old age group has increased over the past year (Chart 3.10);  on average, people in this age group have relatively high levels of debt.  Second, falls in financial wealth may have lowered households’ income expectations.  That is likely to be of particular concern to those closest to retirement age.  Participation rates for these groups have continued to increase, albeit more slowly than in recent years.  A third possible explanation is that individuals may expect the weakness in the labour market to be short-lived, so that few unemployed individuals have become discouraged and stopped looking for work. It remains possible that labour supply will fall back, as it did in the early 1980s (Chart 3.9).  If so, this would lower the growth of the supply capacity of the economy.  Some people may decide to leave the labour market permanently.  For others, a prolonged absence could lead to a deterioration in their skills, making it more difficult for them to return to the labour market when prospects improve.  A persistent reduction in labour supply would attenuate the impact of weak labour demand in lowering wage pressure. There are additional labour market channels through which potential supply might be reduced, even if measured labour 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Quarters after the LFS unemployment rate started to increase Percentage points 2008 Q2–2009 Q1(b)   1990 Q3–1993 Q3 1979 Q3–1982 Q3  + – Source:  Labour Force Survey.

Chart 3.10 Changes in economic activity rates by age   Section 3 Output and supply 33 supply remains resilient.  First, unemployed workers may reduce the time and effort they spend searching for work, reducing the downward pressure on wages.  The likelihood of this happening will depend, in part, on the persistence of  weak labour demand.  Second, if there is a change in the sectoral composition of jobs, then when demand recovers there could be some mismatch between the skills of the unemployed, and those skills which companies are seeking. This too could reduce the potential supply of the economy,  so reducing the extent to which rising unemployment reduces wage pressure.  Another possible impact on potential supply is through changes in migration flows.  Migration from A8 Accession countries has boosted UK potential supply since 2004.  But as the UK economy slows, net migration may moderate. Offsetting this, however, migration flows are also likely to be affected by the economic situation in the home countries of recent and potential migrants — in recent months the outlook for Central and Eastern European countries has deteriorated markedly.  Data from the Civil Aviation Authority on net passenger airflows, one indicator of migratory flows, suggest that, up to the end of 2008, there had not been a marked decline in net migration to the United Kingdom from the  A8 Accession countries (Chart 3.11).   Labour market tightness The labour market has loosened significantly over the past year.  The vacancy to unemployment ratio — a summary indicator of labour market tightness — has fallen, and companies report that recruitment difficulties have eased (Table 3.A).  Further loosening in the labour market is likely, although some of the reduction in employment could be offset by a moderation in potential labour supply growth. 20 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 1998 2000 02 04 06 08 Quarterly change (thousands) + – Sources:  Civil Aviation Authority — Airport Statistics and Bank calculations.

(b) Includes a rounding residual. Since the February Report, CPI inflation — the measure targeted by the MPC — has remained elevated.  In March 2009, annual CPI inflation was 2.9%, down from 3.2% in February and 3.0% in January.  The February outturn, which was more than 1 percentage point above the 2% target, triggered an open letter from the Governor to the Chancellor, on behalf of the MPC.(1) Food and utilities prices continued to boost annual inflation throughout 2009 Q1, and contributed nearly 2 percentage points to CPI inflation in March (Chart 4.1).   Recent inflation outturns have tended to be higher than expected by market participants (Table 4.A).  The Q1 data were also towards the upper edge of the MPC’s February CPI inflation fan chart.  Some of that surprising strength is likely to have reflected stronger, or faster, exchange rate pass-through, following the fall in sterling since the middle of 2007 (Section 4.1). The lower level of sterling is likely to continue to exert upwards pressure on CPI inflation for a while.  But, as discussed in Section 4.2, the path of inflation will also depend on how businesses respond to the combination of higher imported costs and a significant margin of spare capacity (Section 3). The near-term outlook for inflation is discussed in Section 4.3, alongside recent movements in measures of inflation expectations. 4.1 The exchange rate and inflation The sterling ERI has fallen by around a quarter since mid-2007. That has had a pronounced effect on many businesses’ costs, by increasing the price of imported goods and services used in production.  The degree to which businesses pass those 4 Costs and prices Since the February Report, CPI inflation has remained close to 3%, significantly higher than the 2% target.  Past falls in the sterling effective exchange rate continued to put upwards pressure on inflation through their influence on import prices and businesses’ costs.  Pay growth eased markedly, reflecting both sharp falls in bonus payments and a significant reduction in pay settlements. Output price inflation fell back and most surveys of corporate pricing intentions weakened further. Measures of inflation expectations were broadly consistent with inflation returning to the target.

(a) One month ahead market forecasts, based on between 28 and 33 forecasts for CPI inflation.  Section 4 Costs and prices 35 increases in costs into their final prices is a key issue for the inflation outlook. The magnitude and speed of pass-through from changes in the exchange rate to changes in consumer prices varies according to both economic conditions and the cause of the change in the exchange rate.  In the past, the degree of pass-through has also varied markedly across different types of goods and services.  For example, the prices of some products, such as petrol, tend to move closely with the exchange rate.  That is because petrol prices are closely related to sterling oil prices (Chart 4.2), which in turn reflect developments in globally determined US dollar oil prices, and in the sterling-dollar exchange rate. Food prices, which have contributed strongly to CPI inflation in 2008 and 2009, have also been boosted significantly by the fall in sterling.  In part, that has reflected the resulting increases in the price of imported food.  But in addition, the price of domestically produced food tends to respond particularly strongly to exchange rate movements against the euro.  That is because when sterling falls, UK farmers can achieve higher prices by exporting their produce to nearby European trading partners.  As a result, depreciations against the euro tend to be followed by rising domestic food prices, which encourage farmers to sell their output in the United Kingdom (Chart 4.3). But the final prices of many other goods and services appear to respond much more slowly to changes in the exchange rate. For example, although the import prices of goods other than food and energy have risen markedly since sterling began to depreciate in the middle of 2007, a related measure of consumer prices — retail goods price inflation excluding food and fuels — has remained subdued so far (Chart 4.4).(1) That muted response may reflect the growing margin of spare capacity, which is likely to have prompted businesses to either absorb some of the rise in import costs in temporarily lower profit margins, or to offset it by bearing down on other costs (Section 4.2).   Nonetheless, in the past, non-food, non-energy retail goods price inflation has eventually tended to increase following periods of rising import price inflation (Chart 4.4).  But even once retail goods price inflation has picked up, the overall impact on aggregate inflation has been less clear.  That may, in part, have been because the growth rate of nominal spending (which is ultimately determined by monetary policy) was relatively stable.  Therefore, increases in the prices of some goods and services may have meant that household spending on other items tended to fall, putting downward pressure on the prices of those goods and services.  That may have served to offset the impact of higher import prices — aggregate Chart 4.3 UK and euro-area agricultural output prices and the sterling-euro exchange rate 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 1995 97 99 2001 03 05 07 09 Indices:  2002 = 100 Sterling-euro exchange rate(a) Ratio of UK to EU agricultural   output prices(b)  Sources:  Bank of England, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Eurostat.

Overall, judging the likely impact on inflation of the exchange rate depreciation is difficult.  But given that imports account for around one quarter of the CPI basket, the impact on consumer prices could be large.  The MPC judges that much of the strength of CPI inflation over the past three months reflected the impact of the fall in sterling.  The Committee’s assessment of likely future pass-through, and its impact on the inflation projection, is discussed in Section 5. 4.2 Labour costs and companies’ pricing intentions Recent movements in businesses’ costs and prices have been shaped by the balance of two factors.  First, the impact of the marked rise in import prices following the fall in the exchange rate since the middle of 2007 (Section 4.1).  And second, the recent falls in demand (Section 2), together with the associated rise in spare capacity (Section 3). Both these factors are likely to prompt businesses to bear down on labour costs.  But they have opposing implications for output prices.  On the one hand, businesses may raise prices in an attempt to recoup some of the rise in import costs.  But on the other hand, the falls in demand will encourage businesses to cut prices in an effort to increase sales.  This subsection discusses the latest developments in companies’ labour costs, output prices and pricing intentions. Labour costs Overall earnings growth fell very sharply in the early months of 2009.  Compared to a year earlier, the whole-economy average earnings index (AEI) fell by 0.4% in January and by 2.1% in February, the first such falls in earnings since the series began in 1964 (Chart 4.5).  The average weekly earnings measure was even weaker, falling by nearly 6% in the year to February.   The falls in overall earnings growth mainly reflected sharp falls in bonuses, particularly in the financial sector.  Because bonuses are usually related to past performance, changes in bonus payments may contain limited information about future pay pressures.  Annual AEI regular pay growth, which excludes bonus payments and hence is likely to be more informative about future pay pressures, fell back to 2.9% in February, from 3.4% in January.  The latest wage settlements data also point to weak earnings growth.  For example, around 20% of private sector wage settlements agreed so far in 2009 were for no increase in basic pay, compared with less than 2% of settlements over the past eight years (Chart 4.6).  And, according to the Bank’s regional Agents, a small but growing minority of businesses had either made cuts in pay or were planning to do so.

Section 4 Costs and prices 37 The recent weakness in earnings is likely to reflect the combined influence of a number of factors.  First, the contraction in output is likely to have reduced businesses’ demand for labour, increasing the degree of labour market slack (Section 3), and so reducing pay pressures.  Chart 4.7 shows that the largest falls in regular pay growth have tended to occur in those sectors that have experienced the sharpest contractions in output.  Second, businesses may have reacted to exchange rate driven increases in import prices by cutting back on other costs, such as their wage bills.  In the past, earnings growth has tended to be relatively weak during periods of strong import price inflation (Chart 4.8).   Both these factors are likely to continue to exert downward pressure on pay growth.  As a result, the future path of wages will depend on both the persistence and severity of the recession, and also on the trends in businesses’ other costs. But it will also depend on the degree of wage flexibility in the labour market.  Reports from the Bank’s regional Agents towards the end of 2008 suggested that employees had become increasingly anxious about their job security following the onset of the recession, and that this had reduced their resistance to weaker pay growth.  That influence may have grown in importance, given the further increases in unemployment and falls in output.  Employers may then be able to achieve more of their desired reduction in labour costs through weaker pay, rather than through reductions in employment.  The Committee’s judgements on wages are discussed in Section 5. Companies’ output prices and pricing intentions The rise in import costs and the falls in demand exert opposing pressures on companies’ output prices.  To the extent that they are unable to bear down sufficiently on labour costs, businesses may recoup increases in their costs, such as those associated with rises in import prices, by raising output prices. But at the same time, businesses tend to respond to weakness in output, and the associated build-up of spare capacity, by cutting prices to stimulate demand (Chart 4.9). Manufacturing output price inflation has continued to fall sharply.  Part of that reflects the impact of previous falls in oil prices on petrol prices.  But output price inflation excluding petrol has also slowed, suggesting that the effect from weaker demand may have dominated the impact of the exchange rate. Looking ahead, most surveys of corporate pricing intentions weakened further, pointing to a further easing in output price inflation in the coming months.  4.3 The near-term inflation outlook and changes in inflation expectations The near-term inflation outlook Despite recent unexpectedly high outturns, the MPC continues to expect CPI inflation to fall back to below the 2% Table 4.B Announced changes in gas and electricity prices(a) Dates Market shares(b) Price cuts (per cent) effective (per cent) Gas Electricity (Gas/electricity) British Gas 10.0 10.0 19 Feb./7 May 44/22 E.ON – 9.0 31 Mar. 13/18 Scottish and Southern Energy 4.0 9.0 30 Mar. 15/19 npower – 8.0 31 Mar. 12/15 ScottishPower 7.5 3.0 31 Mar. 9/12 EDF Energy – 8.8 31 Mar. 7/13 Sources:  Company press releases and Ofgem.

In particular, announced cuts in domestic gas and electricity prices (Table 4.B) will exert further downward pressure on CPI inflation from April.   Furthermore, wholesale gas futures prices for the second half of 2009 were around 25% lower than at the time of the February Report (Chart 4.10).  As a result, the MPC’s projections are conditioned on the assumption of further retail energy price cuts later this year, which reduce average gas and electricity bills by around 15%.  That is a larger reduction than incorporated in the February projections (see the box on page 43).  Spot oil prices have crept higher over the past three months, averaging around $50 per barrel in the fifteen working days to 6 May.  The futures curve over the next three years was around 6% higher (in dollar terms) than at the time of the February Report (see the box on page 43). There are significant risks to the near-term outlook for CPI inflation.  For example, on the upside, businesses may choose to pass through a larger part of the rise in import costs into their final prices rather than pushing down on wages and employment.  But on the downside, the margin of spare capacity may put greater pressure on wages and prices.  The MPC’s latest projections for CPI inflation are discussed in Section 5. As expected at the time of the February Report, RPI inflation has eased back further over the past three months, turning negative in March for the first time since 1960.  The growing wedge between RPI and CPI inflation in recent months mainly reflects the impact of the lower level of Bank Rate on household mortgage interest payments.  But it also reflects the impact of further falls in house prices on the housing components of the RPI (Table 4.C).  The MPC expects RPI inflation to fall further over the coming months. Inflation expectations Inflation expectations play an important role in determining the path of inflation.  Measures of near-term household inflation expectations, on average, suggest that inflation is expected to be slightly below the 2% target in a year’s time (Chart 4.11).   There was, however, an unusually wide range of views about the short-term inflation outlook.  For example, a historically high proportion (around 15%) of respondents to the February 2009 Bank/NOP survey expected inflation to be negative in a year’s time.  But a similar proportion continued to expect inflation to exceed 5% over the same period.  The unusually wide spread of responses may reflect uncertainties about how the opposing influences of, on the one hand, the fall in the exchange rate, and on the other, the recession will affect Chart 4.10 UK wholesale gas prices 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 2002 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 Pence per therm Spot price(a) February 2009 Report   futures curve(b)  May 2009 Report   futures curve(b)  Sources:  Bloomberg, Reuters and Bank calculations.

There are three main factors supporting a recovery in output growth over the forecast period.  First, the recent drag on growth from de-stocking is likely to ease over the coming quarters.  Second, the significant policy stimulus in train at home and abroad will provide a boost to UK and global growth.  Since the February Report, the MPC has cut Bank Rate to 0.5%, and announced a programme of asset purchases totalling £125 billion, including an extension by a further  £50 billion announced on 7 May, in order to boost the growth of money and credit and of nominal demand.  Third, the lower level of sterling should shift both domestic and overseas expenditure towards goods and services produced in the United Kingdom, shielding domestic activity from some of the effects of the slowdown in world trade.   But there are three key factors which could moderate the pace of that recovery.  First, the availability of credit to companies and households may improve only gradually;  that depends importantly on developments in the domestic and overseas banking systems.  Second, households and companies may save more and spend less, for example due to concerns over future earnings or if they anticipate that the increased level of The outlook for domestic activity and inflation continues to be dominated by the balance between opposing forces.  The adjustments under way in the UK economy, combined with weak global demand, continue to act as a significant drag on economic activity.  But pushing in the opposite direction there is considerable economic stimulus in train.  That stimulus should lead to a recovery in growth over the forecast period, but the strength and timing of that recovery is highly uncertain. CPI inflation is likely to drop below the 2% target later this year, driven in part by diminishing contributions from food and energy prices offsetting the upward impetus from the depreciation of sterling.  The persistent and substantial margin of spare capacity is also likely to push down on inflation.  Under the assumptions that Bank Rate moves in line with market interest rates and the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves reaches £125 billion, it is more likely than not that CPI inflation will be below the 2% inflation target in the medium term. There are significant risks to the inflation outlook in each direction, with downside risks from weaker activity and an upside risk from the depreciation of sterling.  The assessment of these risks is key to MPC decisions.  Section 5 Prospects for inflation 41 government borrowing will lead to higher taxes in future. Third, the domestic and global economies are vulnerable to further shocks, particularly given weak consumer and business sentiment.   Given these offsetting factors, the outlook for GDP growth is unusually uncertain.  As a consequence, the Committee has more confidence in the broad shape of the GDP fan charts than on their precise calibration.  That is also reflected in a widening of the bands around the GDP fan charts relative to the February Report.  All the fan charts describing the MPC’s latest projections shown in this section are conditioned on the assumption that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves reaches £125 billion and remains at that level throughout the forecast period.  Chart 5.1 shows the outlook for four-quarter GDP growth, and Chart 5.2 represents a cross-section of that fan chart in 2010 Q2.  Both are conditioned on the assumption that Bank Rate follows a path implied by market rates.  The projected distribution for GDP growth is below that in the February Report, reflecting lower-than-expected output at home and abroad in the first quarter of 2009, and a judgement that it is likely to take longer for bank lending to return to normal than assumed in February. On balance, the Committee judges that these factors point to a relatively slow recovery in economic activity.   Despite the projected recovery in activity, a substantial margin of spare capacity is likely to persist over the forecast period. Chart 5.3 shows the Committee’s best collective judgement about the outlook for CPI inflation under the same assumptions that underpin Chart 5.1.  CPI inflation is likely to drop below the 2% target later this year, driven in part by diminishing contributions from food and energy prices.  At the start of 2010, there is an upward impetus from the reversal of the VAT cut but much of this is likely to be offset by other factors, including a negative effect from the substantial margin of spare capacity.  That pulls down on inflation throughout the forecast period, offsetting the upward pressure from the depreciation of sterling.   The relative magnitude of these opposing influences on inflation is highly uncertain and there is a range of views on the relative strength of these forces among Committee members. The downward pressure from the margin of spare capacity will depend on the timing and strength of the recovery, as well as the impact of the slowdown on the growth of productive supply, and the sensitivity of inflation to the degree of slack in the economy.  The pass-through from the lower level of sterling to consumer prices will depend critically on the behaviour of the labour market and the extent to which companies adjust to higher import costs by bearing down on wages.  As with the fan charts for GDP, the Committee has more confidence in the broad shape of the fan chart than on its precise calibration.  The balance of these factors suggest that, conditioned on the market path for interest rates, it is more 2005 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 Percentage increases in output on a year earlier 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 – + Bank estimates of past growth  Projection ONS data The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for GDP growth.  It has been conditioned on the assumption that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves reaches £125 billion and remains there throughout the forecast period.  To the left of the first vertical dashed line, the distribution reflects the likelihood of revisions to the data over the past;  to the right, it reflects uncertainty over the evolution of GDP growth in the future.  If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that the mature estimate of GDP growth would lie within the darkest central band on only 10 of those occasions.  The fan chart is constructed so that outturns are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter green areas on 10 occasions.  In any particular quarter of the forecast period, GDP is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fan on 90 out of 100 occasions.  The bands widen as the time horizon is extended, indicating the increasing uncertainty about outcomes.  See the box on page 39 of the November 2007 Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.  The second dashed line is drawn at the two-year point of the projection.

The coloured bands have a similar interpretation to those on the fan charts.  Like the fan charts, they portray the central 90% of the probability distribution.  If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that the mature estimate of GDP growth in 2010 Q2 would lie somewhere within the range covered by the histogram on 90 occasions.  GDP growth would lie outside the range covered by the histogram on 10 out of 100 occasions.  (b) Average probability within each band.

The projected distribution for inflation in the medium term is higher than in the February Report (Chart 5.4).   Chart 5.5 shows the GDP projection over the next two years on the assumption that Bank Rate is held constant, while  Chart 5.6 shows the corresponding projection for CPI inflation. The risks of inflation being above or below target become more evenly balanced towards the two-year horizon.     5.2 Key risks to demand When will credit supply recover? The outlook for credit supply is a key uncertainty, and depends in part on the adjustment under way in the banking system. The UK banking system expanded rapidly in recent years, with funding from sources other than retail deposits enabling banks to increase lending significantly.  Banks are now in the process of reassessing the scale of their lending, reflecting an increase in their perceptions of risk and a reduction in their access to funding.  In principle, banks could reduce the scale of their lending gradually.  But, as the economic outlook has deteriorated, so banks’ current and prospective losses have increased and there has been an abrupt reduction in the supply of credit to households and companies. Various interventions by the authorities should support credit supply over the forecast period.  The UK Government has put in place a range of measures designed to improve the ability  of banks to absorb losses and raise funding (Section 1).   Lloyds Banking Group and the Royal Bank of Scotland, the two banks participating in the Asset Protection Scheme, have each made lending commitments.

If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that inflation in any particular quarter would lie within the darkest central band on only 10 of those occasions.  The fan charts are constructed so that outturns of inflation are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter red areas on 10 occasions.  In any particular quarter of the forecast period, inflation is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fans on 90 out of 100 occasions.  The bands widen as the time horizon is extended, indicating the increasing uncertainty about outcomes.  See the box on pages 48–49 of the May 2002 Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.

Chart 5.5 GDP projection based on constant nominal interest rates at 0.5% and £125 billion asset purchases  Section 5 Prospects for inflation 43 and HSBC, have also announced that they intend to expand their lending over the next year.   These Government interventions by themselves, however, may not increase lending sufficiently.  For instance, banks might respond to recent strains by choosing to hold more capital against their loans than before, which would inhibit their lending.  The reassessment of lending is being carried out by overseas, as well as UK, banks.  Foreign-owned banks played a particularly significant role in the expansion of lending to the UK corporate sector in recent years.  Some of them are scaling back their lending outside their home countries.  That means some UK companies may need to replace loans as they mature, either from UK banks or the capital markets.   The ability of some large, highly rated companies to raise funding outside the banking system has improved recently. Gross issuance in capital markets has risen since the start of this year.  And the cost of raising funds in the commercial paper and corporate bond markets has fallen, possibly helped by the establishment of the Bank of England’s Asset Purchase Facility (Section 1).  Small and medium-sized companies are, Financial and energy market assumptions As a benchmark assumption, the projections for GDP growth and CPI inflation described in Charts 5.1 and 5.3 are conditioned on a path for official interest rates implied by market interest rates (Table 1).  In the period leading up to the MPC’s May decision, the path implied by forward market interest rates was for Bank Rate to remain close to 0.5% for the rest of 2009 before rising gradually.  That was broadly similar to the path assumed in the February Report.   In addition, the projections are conditioned on an assumption that the total stock of asset purchases financed by the issuance of central bank reserves reaches £125 billion and remains there for the remainder of the forecast period. The starting point for sterling’s effective exchange rate index (ERI) in the MPC’s projections was 78.7, the average for the fifteen working days to 6 May.  That was 3.3% above the starting point for the February projections.  Under the MPC’s usual convention,(1) the exchange rate is assumed to depreciate slightly, to 78.4 by 2011 Q2, but is still higher throughout the forecast period than assumed in February. The starting point for UK equity prices in the MPC’s projections was 2115 — the average of the FTSE All-Share for the fifteen working days to 6 May.  That was 1.9% above the starting point for the February projection.  In the long run, equity wealth is assumed to grow in line with nominal GDP;  in the short run, it also reflects changes in the share of profits in GDP. Energy prices are assumed to evolve broadly in line with the paths implied by futures markets over the forecast period. Average Brent oil futures prices for the next three years were around 6% higher (in US dollar terms) than at the time of the February Report.  Wholesale gas futures prices for the second half of 2009 were around 25% lower, but broadly similar by the end of the forecast period.  There is considerable uncertainty about the scale and pace of the pass-through of changes in wholesale energy prices to the prices of gas and electricity faced by households and companies.  But the central projection is conditioned on a benchmark assumption that domestic energy bills are cut in the second half of 2009, reducing average gas and electricity prices by around 15%, a larger reduction than assumed in the February Report.

(b) May figure for 2009 Q2 is an average of realised spot rates to 6 May, and forward rates thereafter. (1) The convention is that the sterling exchange rate follows a path which is half way between the starting level of the sterling ERI and a path implied by interest rate differentials.  44 Inflation Report  May 2009 however, unlikely to be able to raise funds in capital markets easily, and remain heavily reliant on bank lending.   It is extremely difficult to assess the time it will take for bank lending to return to more normal levels.  On balance, the MPC judges that it is likely to take somewhat longer than envisaged in the February Report.  An even slower recovery of credit growth would delay the recovery of nominal demand further.   Will there be a sharp retrenchment in household spending? Consumption is likely to remain weak in the near term.  Falling employment is likely to reduce household income growth and hence spending.  And tight credit conditions will mean that some households are unable to borrow — and spend — as much as they would like.  In the last quarter of 2008, there was a sharp increase in the proportion of income saved by households (Section 2). A key uncertainty facing the MPC is whether this likely weakness of consumption will be augmented by other factors raising household saving.  Past falls in financial asset prices and increased uncertainty associated with the economic downturn may lead households to augment their saving.  Should households become more worried about their job prospects or future income, they may decide to save more or pay down debt as a precaution.  Households might also reappraise the prospects for their income in the medium to long term.  For instance, in the 2009 Budget the Government revised up substantially its projection for public sector net borrowing. That could pull down on consumer spending if households expect the increased level of borrowing to lead to higher taxes in future.  And if households fear that it will be difficult to obtain credit in the future, either because of reduced credit availability or because of the reduced value of housing collateral, then they may decide to increase saving.  As a result of these factors, there is a risk of a further sharp adjustment in household spending.     A number of other factors should encourage households to spend rather than save.  The considerable stimulus in train should support household spending.  Government measures already enacted to support lending should improve the flow of credit (Section 1).  The low level of Bank Rate will reduce  debt-servicing costs faced by households and companies, and, combined with the MPC’s asset purchases, should raise asset prices, increasing households’ financial wealth.  And past falls in commodity prices will boost the purchasing power of household incomes.   Given these offsetting factors, it is uncertain by how much households will want to increase saving, and over what period this adjustment will take place.  The MPC’s judgement is that there is likely to be a fairly pronounced increase in saving in the near term, and that over the medium term households are  Section 5 Prospects for inflation 45 likely to continue to save more of their income than in recent years.  This increase in desired saving dampens household spending over the forecast period.  But, over time, strengthening income growth — reflecting stronger employment growth and a pickup in wage growth — is likely to support a relatively subdued recovery in spending.  An even sharper retrenchment by households would depress consumption to a greater extent, posing a significant downside risk to activity.    What are the implications of the contraction in world trade for UK activity? In recent months, there has been a precipitous decline in world trade flows (Section 2).  In part, that reflected a sharp contraction in global activity.  GDP fell in many countries in the last quarter of 2008, and the available indicators suggest that in the first quarter of 2009 output continued to decline  in a number of countries, including the United States, the  euro area and Japan.  But even relative to the fall in world output, the scale of the recent contraction in trade flows appears unusually large.   There is uncertainty about the reasons behind, and the likely persistence of, the contraction in world trade.  Some of the sharp reduction in trade flows is probably associated with a marked reduction in inventory holdings.  It is also likely to reflect the composition of the drop in world demand, which has been disproportionately concentrated in highly traded goods such as capital equipment, motor vehicles and other consumer durables.  Because different stages in production of these goods often take place in different countries, a decline in the demand for them may trigger a far greater fall in trade flows.  This suggests that, when global demand picks up, trade should also recover.  But an additional possible factor underlying the weakness of global trade is a reduction in the availability of credit used to facilitate international trade.  This could lead to more persistent weakness in trade flows if the supply of credit remains tight for a period.  It is difficult to determine how important reduced access to trade credit has been.   The United Kingdom is a relatively open economy, and so persistent weakness in world trade could significantly restrain UK output.  But a number of factors should mitigate this effect.  First, the United Kingdom exports relatively more services than other countries;  goods make up a smaller proportion of UK exports than for the world as a whole. Second, to the extent that the weakening of world trade reflects the global nature of supply chains, UK imports as well as exports may also contract, reducing the impact on overall UK activity.  And, third, the substantial depreciation of sterling will encourage spending by domestic and overseas consumers to switch towards UK-produced goods and services.  That should mean that UK exports will fall by less than world trade, and should reduce UK import growth.       46 Inflation Report  May 2009 Overall, the Committee judges that world trade is likely to recover somewhat over the coming year, and that the total fall in UK exports will be smaller than the total fall in world trade. Net trade is likely to contribute to growth over the forecast period, in part reflecting the depreciation of sterling.  But there is a risk of an extended contraction of trade flows, for example as a result of a slower restoration of lending and a more gradual improvement in confidence at home and abroad.  That would delay the recovery of both the global and domestic economies. 5.3 Key risks to inflation The downside risks to demand described above pose downside risks to the outlook for inflation.  The impact of weaker demand growth on CPI inflation depends on both the extent to which that weaker demand leads to an increase in the degree of spare capacity, and on the sensitivity of inflation to spare capacity.  The outlook for inflation also depends importantly on the extent to which increases in import prices following the past depreciation in sterling push up on consumer prices and on the behaviour of inflation expectations.   To what extent will weaker demand reduce inflation?   The slowdown in demand and the restriction in the availability of credit are likely to weaken the growth of productive supply in the economy, reducing the degree of spare capacity that emerges.  Perhaps most importantly, the ongoing adjustment in the banking system and heightened economic uncertainty have reduced the availability of working capital, which may constrain some companies’ output.  More generally, weak demand and subdued credit growth will depress business investment.  Some companies are likely to become insolvent as a result of falling demand and lower revenue, and some of their capital may be scrapped or used less efficiently.  It may prove hard to launch new companies given constraints on lending by banks.  And the growth of the effective labour supply may slow, for instance if unemployed individuals reduce the time and effort they spend looking for work, or leave the labour market altogether (Section 3).   The Committee judges that the growth of productive supply is likely to weaken over the forecast period, reducing the build-up of spare capacity in the economy.  But the precise extent to which supply will adjust is very uncertain, and there are upside and downside risks to inflation from alternative judgements. How will sterling’s depreciation affect consumer prices?   The sterling ERI has recovered slightly over recent months to around 3% higher than at the time of the February Report.  But it remains around a quarter lower than in mid-2007.  That significant depreciation is continuing to raise companies’ imported costs.  Companies can adjust to those higher costs through a combination of responses, and the nature and speed  Section 5 Prospects for inflation 47 of their adjustment will affect the prospects for inflation in the near term.   If companies were mainly to adjust to higher imported costs by raising their prices, that would tend to raise CPI inflation. That effect could be material, given that around a quarter of the CPI basket is imported.  But some of the adjustment to the increases in imported costs is likely to be borne by companies pushing down on non-imported costs, including wages.  And some companies may initially not pass through higher costs, and instead accept lower profit margins for a while.    While it is hard to assess exactly how the adjustment to higher imported costs will take place, the Committee’s judgement is that some part of it is likely to occur through weaker wages. That judgement partly reflects the weakness of demand, which may make it difficult for companies to increase prices if they wish to support sales.  It also reflects some recent evidence of considerable nominal wage flexibility and the likely influence of the inflation-targeting regime in anchoring inflation expectations.  There is, however, a risk that a greater proportion of the adjustment will take place by companies increasing prices, posing an upside risk to inflation in the near term.   How will expectations of inflation be affected? The Committee judges that inflation expectations are likely to remain anchored around the inflation target.  If that were not the case, however, there could be significant implications for the inflation outlook.  There are downside risks to expectations from a prolonged period of below-target inflation, and upside risks from the depreciation in sterling and the substantial monetary and fiscal expansion. 5.4 Summary and the policy decision As discussed in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, there are a number of factors that may delay the recovery in output.  In particular, weak credit supply growth, a sharper retrenchment by households, and a more protracted contraction in global activity would all increase the risk of a relatively weak recovery in GDP growth.  As discussed in Sections 5.1 and 5.3, the key factors affecting the spread of the CPI distribution are:  how much spare capacity develops and how this feeds through into inflation;  and how consumer prices are affected by sterling’s depreciation.  The spread of outcomes for CPI inflation at the two-year horizon is shown in Chart 5.7, and the equivalent outlook at the time of the February Report is shown in  Chart 5.8.  Charts 5.9 and 5.10 show frequency distributions for inflation and output at the two and three-year horizons.  The outlook for growth is dominated by two opposing sets of forces.  In monitoring the impact of those forces on growth, the Committee will focus in particular on:  indicators of banks’ access to funding and their willingness to supply loans,  48 Inflation Report  May 2009 <1.5 1.5–2.0 2.0–2.5 >2.5 Probability, per cent CPI inﬂation (percentage increase in prices on a year earlier) 2011 Q2 2012 Q2 0 20 40 60 80 100 (a) These figures are derived from the same distribution as Chart 5.3.

It has been conditioned on the assumption that the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves reaches £125 billion and remains there throughout the forecast period.  The coloured bands have a similar interpretation to those on the fan charts.  Like the fan charts, they portray the central 90% of the probability distribution.  If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that inflation in 2011 Q2 would lie somewhere within the range covered by the histogram on 90 occasions.  Inflation would lie outside the range covered by the histogram on 10 out of 100 occasions.  Chart 5.8 shows the corresponding cross-section of the February 2009 Inflation Report fan chart.

In evaluating the evolving outlook for inflation, the Committee will, in addition, monitor:  the evidence regarding the  pass-through into prices of sterling’s depreciation;  the response of wages to the growing margin of spare capacity and higher import prices;  and the evolution of measures of inflation expectations.   At its May meeting, the Committee noted that the immediate prospect was for CPI inflation to fall substantially below the 2% target, while output continued to contract.  But a substantial stimulus was in train which should lead to a recovery in output growth.  There were significant uncertainties regarding the inflation outlook relating to the timing and strength of that recovery and the extent of the pass-through from sterling’s depreciation.  In the light of that outlook, the Committee judged that maintaining Bank Rate at 0.5% and increasing the size of the programme of asset purchases financed by the issuance of central bank reserves by £50 billion to a total of £125 billion was, on balance, most likely to keep CPI inflation on track to meet the 2% inflation target over the medium term.  Section 5 Prospects for inflation 49 Other forecasters’ expectations Every three months, the Bank asks a sample of external forecasters for their latest economic projections.  This box reports the results from the latest survey, carried out during April.   On average, external forecasters expected annual CPI inflation to have fallen below the inflation target by 2010 Q2, to have remained below 2% in 2011 Q2, and to have picked up in  2012 Q2 (Table 1).  That was slightly weaker than expected three months ago.  On average, the level of GDP in 2010 Q2 was expected to be similar to that a year earlier, but was expected to increase by 1.8% over the following four quarters. Those projections were broadly similar to those made three months earlier.  The level of Bank Rate underlying those projections was also little changed on three months ago.  On average, the sterling ERI was projected to be around 1% higher in the first year, but 2%–3% lower thereafter. In the previous survey, carried out during January, the range of forecasters’ central projections for four-quarter GDP growth a year ahead had been particularly wide.  By contrast, a modal projection re-emerged in the latest survey (Chart A).  The range of central views about the outlook for CPI inflation in a year’s time was also a little narrower than at the time of the February Report.   External forecasters continue to think, however, that there are significant risks around their central projections for both CPI inflation and GDP growth (Table 2).  Despite an average central projection of below-target inflation in 2010 Q2, on average respondents thought that there was around a 25% chance that inflation would be at, or above, target instead. Expectations were similarly diverse for both 2011 Q2 and  2012 Q2 (Chart B).  Although forecasters’ central projections were, on average, for broadly flat output in the year to  2010 Q2, they attached a slightly larger probability to growth being above 1% than to it being below -1%.

World activity continued to weaken, reflecting both depressed confidence and the persistent problems in international credit markets.  In the United Kingdom, output dropped sharply in the fourth quarter of 2008.  That reflected lower consumer spending, a further fall in business investment and a rapid run-down in stocks, in part offset by stronger net exports as the past depreciation of sterling began to take effect. Business surveys continue to point to a similar rate of contraction in the early part of this year.  Unemployment has risen markedly.  Credit conditions faced by companies and households remain tight.  CPI inflation declined to 3.0% in January.  The depreciation of sterling is adding to imported cost pressures, but pay pressures continue to wane. Inflation is likely to fall below the 2% target by the second half of the year, reflecting diminishing contributions from retail energy and food prices and the impact of the temporary reduction in Value Added Tax.  At its March meeting, the Committee noted that the February Inflation Report had implied a substantial risk of undershooting the 2% CPI inflation target in the medium term and that a further easing in monetary policy was likely to be needed.  Data released since the finalisation of the Report had not materially altered that prospect.  Accordingly, the Committee concluded that a further easing in the stance of monetary policy was warranted.  But the Committee also noted that a very low level of Bank Rate could have counter-productive effects on the operation of some financial markets and on the lending capacity of the banking system.  On balance, the Committee decided to reduce Bank Rate by  0.5 percentage points, to 0.5%. The Committee judged that this reduction in Bank Rate would by itself still leave a substantial risk of undershooting the 2% CPI inflation target in the medium term.  Accordingly, the Committee also resolved to undertake further monetary actions, with the aim of boosting the supply of money and credit and thus raising the rate of growth of nominal spending to a level consistent with meeting the inflation target in the medium term. To that end, and noting the recent exchange of letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer concerning the use of the Asset Purchase Facility for monetary policy purposes, the Committee agreed that the Bank should, in the first instance, finance £75 billion of asset purchases by the issuance of central bank reserves.  The Committee recognised that it might take up to three months to carry out this programme of purchases.  Part of that sum would finance the Bank of England’s programme of private sector asset purchases through the Asset Purchase Facility, intended to improve the functioning of corporate credit markets.  But in order to meet the Committee’s objective of total purchases of £75 billion, the Bank would also buy medium and long-maturity conventional gilts in the secondary market.  It is likely that the majority of the overall purchases by value over the next three months will be of gilts. At its future meetings, the Committee will monitor the effectiveness of this purchase programme in boosting the supply of money and credit and in due course raising the rate of growth of nominal spending, adjusting the speed and scale of purchases as appropriate. The minutes of the meeting will be published at 9.30 am on Wednesday 18 March. Text of Bank of England press notice of 9 April 2009 Bank of England maintains Bank Rate at 0.5% and continues with £75 billion Asset Purchase Programme The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee today voted to maintain the official Bank Rate paid on commercial bank reserves at 0.5%. The Committee also voted to continue with the programme, announced on 5 March, of asset purchases totalling £75 billion financed by the issuance of central bank reserves. The Committee noted that since its previous meeting a total of just over £26 billion of asset purchases had been made and that it would take a further two months to complete that programme. The minutes of the meeting will be published at 9.30 am on Wednesday 22 April.  Press Notices 53 Text of Bank of England press notice of 7 May 2009 Bank of England maintains Bank Rate at 0.5% and increases size of Asset Purchase Programme by £50 billion to £125 billion The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee today voted to maintain the official Bank Rate paid on commercial bank reserves at 0.5%. The Committee also voted to continue with its programme of asset purchases financed by the issuance of central bank reserves and to increase its size by £50 billion to a total of £125 billion. The world economy remains in deep recession.  Output has continued to contract and international trade has fallen precipitously.  The global banking and financial system remains fragile despite further significant intervention by the authorities.  In the United Kingdom, GDP fell sharply in the first quarter of 2009.  But surveys at home and abroad show promising signs that the pace of decline has begun to moderate. CPI inflation was 2.9% in March, significantly higher than the 2% inflation target.  Past falls in sterling have continued to put upwards pressure on inflation.  But the degree of spare capacity in the economy has increased and the loosening in the labour market has contributed to a sharp easing in pay pressures.  CPI inflation is likely to drop below the 2% target later this year, driven in part by diminishing contributions from food and energy prices.  The substantial margin of spare capacity in the economy should continue to bear down on inflation thereafter. The Committee noted that the outlook for economic activity was dominated by two countervailing forces.  The process of adjustment in train in the UK economy, as private saving rises and banks restructure their balance sheets, combined with weak global demand, will continue to act as a significant drag on economic activity.  But pushing in the opposite direction, there is considerable economic stimulus stemming from the easing in monetary and fiscal policy, at home and abroad, the substantial depreciation in sterling, past falls in commodity prices, and actions by authorities internationally to improve the availability of credit.  That stimulus should in due course lead to a recovery in economic growth, bringing inflation back towards the 2% target.  But the timing and strength of that recovery is highly uncertain. In the light of that outlook and in order to keep CPI inflation on track to meet the 2% inflation target over the medium term, the Committee judged that maintaining Bank Rate at 0.5% was appropriate.  The Committee also agreed to continue with its programme of purchases of government and corporate debt financed by the issuance of central bank reserves and to increase its size by £50 billion to a total of £125 billion. The Committee expected that it would take another three months to complete that programme, and it will keep the scale of the programme under review. The Committee’s latest inflation and output projections will appear in the Inflation Report to be published on Wednesday 13 May.  The minutes of the meeting will be published at 9.30 am on Wednesday 20 May.  54 Inflation Report  May 2009 Glossary and other information Glossary of selected data and instruments AEI – average earnings index.
