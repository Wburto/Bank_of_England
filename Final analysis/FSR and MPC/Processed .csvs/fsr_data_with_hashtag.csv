The regular article Strengthening financial infrastructure reports progress on a range of initiatives to reduce the risks of spillovers, but focuses, in particular, on two topics. First, the future reform of prudential regulation:  the completion of the text of the new ‘Basel II’ framework for capital standards is a major landmark, but further work is required, notably on how regulation should evolve to reflect the development of credit risk transfer markets and other innovations that enable credit risk to be traded.  While banks increasingly hold such assets in their trading books, there is a question as to the underlying liquidity of markets for these products in stressed conditions.  Second, ‘tiering’ – where some firms make use of financial infrastructures via member firms rather than via direct membership themselves – can give rise to credit, legal, operational and liquidity risks as well as some benefits to participating firms.  The article explores the pros and cons in the context of the United Kingdom’s main financial infrastructures. Just as some banks prefer not to be direct members of domestic payment and settlement systems, David Sawyer’s article Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) and foreign exchange settlement risk shows that some financial intermediaries have chosen not to participate directly in CLS, a system launched two years ago to help reduce settlement risk in the foreign exchange market. Although volumes and values of transactions settled in CLS have continued to grow, over half of global foreign exchange settlement still appears to be taking place outside CLS, especially for transactions involving non-bank financial institutions such as Financial stability themes and issues – Financial Stability Review: December 2004 3 Financial stability themes and issues There has been little sign of major credit risks crystallising since the June Review and financial market conditions have also been relatively benign.  As the main firms and sectors within the UK financial system, and the internationally active financial firms to which they are exposed, generally remain robust, the threats to financial stability in the short run remain subdued.  But the continuing rapid build-up of debt by many borrowers and the aggressive ‘search for yield’ by some market participants may be building up vulnerabilities for the longer term.  The factors contributing to systemic risk are discussed in the Bank of England’s regular assessment of the Financial stability conjuncture and outlook.  hedge funds.  Central banks and supervisors have made clear their interest in how banks manage the counterparty risks to which they are potentially exposed in such transactions.  The authorities continue to monitor whether enough has been done to reduce foreign exchange settlement risk, and to consider what further steps may be necessary. Financial stability risks also arise in connection with the settlement of securities transactions.  In Securities settlement systems:  assessing their relative riskiness, Will Kerry reviews the types of risk entailed and proposes a method for assessing how important the systems in various countries are from the perspective of the UK financial system.  Not surprisingly, the UK system, CREST, heads the list, but those of several other countries could have a material impact too.  The UK authorities, therefore, have an interest in ensuring that adequate minimum requirements for mitigating risks continue to be met by major systems around the world.  To this end, they will, for example, participate in the work to implement the standards recently developed by the Committee of European Securities Regulators and the European System of Central Banks. The smooth functioning of payments systems – especially large-value payments systems – is a particularly important aspect of financial stability.  In Collateral posting decisions in CHAPS Sterling1, Kevin James and Matthew Willison investigate why banks that are members of CHAPS Sterling, the main domestic UK large-value payments system, tend to post more collateral with the Bank of England than usually needed to support their payment activities.  They argue that it is likely to reflect the fact that the cost to members of being unable to make a payment is high relative to the cost of posting collateral.  The benefit for financial stability is that, even if individual banks do face temporary operational difficulties making payments, others are likely to have sufficient liquidity available for the rest of the system to continue to function smoothly. Financial stability authorities can help align the incentives facing financial market participants with the public policy objective of reducing threats to the stability of the financial system as a whole.  For example, they can promote appropriate financial market conventions, encouraging market practice to converge on arrangements that promote systemic stability.  In Collective Action Clauses (CACS):  an analysis of provisions included in recent sovereign bond issues,2 John Drage and Catherine Hovaguimian review progress on one such initiative, to promote a more orderly framework for restructuring sovereign debt when necessary.  The paper, summarised in this Review, observes that the widespread 4 Financial Stability Review: December 2004 – Financial stability themes and issues Financial stability themes and issues Financial Stability Review December 2004 (1) Published first on the Bank website on 2 November 2004 at www.bankofengland.co.uk/fsr/fsr17art8.pdf (2) Published first on the Bank website on 2 November 2004 at www.bankofengland.co.uk/fsr/fsr17art9.pdf  adoption of majority amendment provisions is welcome progress. The paper identifies a number of further innovations that could contribute to financial stability, in particular:  the appointment of a bondholder representative;  clauses permitting the aggregation of majority action provisions over a number of different bond issues;  and more explicit collective action provisions in syndicated loans. Sir Andrew Large, the Bank of England’s Deputy Governor for Financial Stability, has recently emphasised the part that well-designed accounting standards play in maintaining financial stability.  In a speech to the thirteenth City of London Central Banking Conference, reprinted here, he argues that, in looking in the longer term towards a revision of IAS 39 (a standard dealing with financial instruments), it might be helpful to seek a shared understanding about who and what accounts are for;  whether, and if so how, fair value measures can be accommodated alongside historic cost measures;  and the implications of a wider application of fair values for the volatility of accounting results. This theme is also touched on in Strengthening financial infrastructure, which makes the point that prudential regulation and accounting standards need to evolve in parallel if the benefits of financial innovation are to be fully realised. The debate about accounting standards is, in part, a debate about the transparency of a firm’s financial affairs.  In the wake of the various financial crises around the world in the 1 990s, several bodies – notably the IMF and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision – have called for increased transparency of banking firms.  The idea is to provide market incentives for banks to manage their risks more prudently.  But is transparency necessarily beneficial when a bank is already under stress?  In Bank stability and transparency, Erlend Nier looks at empirical evidence to consider how, on balance, bank transparency affects the probability of severe systemic problems.  He argues that banks that disclose more information in their annual accounts are less at risk and, hence, a regime of enhanced transparency should help reduce the incidence of banking failure.  The so-called ‘Pillar 3’ disclosures by banks under the Basel II framework could, therefore, contribute further to financial stability. Erlend Nier’s article focuses on banks, which, in general, are the intermediaries most likely to give rise to systemic risk.  But non-bank financial sectors can also affect UK financial stability adversely.  In Assessing risks from UK non-bank financial sectors, Matthew Corder outlines the various channels through which problems might be transmitted:  via disruption to non-banks’ provision of financial services to households, counterparty exposures, non-banks’ activities in capital markets and effects on confidence.  Focusing on UK-resident firms as an example, he identifies the sectors with the greatest potential to threaten the Financial stability themes and issues – Financial Stability Review: December 2004 5  stability of the UK financial system, and suggests that they are: securities dealers;  building societies;  life insurers and pension funds;  so-called non-bank ‘other finance providers’;  and general insurers. Whatever the sector, individual financial institutions are likely to be more vulnerable to shocks, with potential systemic spillover effects, if – all other things equal – their appetite for risk increases.  ‘Risk appetite’ is frequently cited as a key factor driving broad trends in asset prices.  And rapid changes in the willingness of investors to bear risk can generate strong correlations among the prices of seemingly unrelated assets, greatly exacerbating market risk.  This has been the underlying concern behind the discussion of the search for yield in recent Reviews.  Risk appetite:  concept and measurement, by Prasanna Gai and Nicholas Vause, reviews the concept and measurement of risk appetite, suggesting a precise definition that might usefully be adopted more widely.  The article explores the analytical basis of risk appetite, distinguishes it from ‘risk premia’ and ‘risk aversion’, and proposes a way of measuring it.  It also reviews a number of other measures used by financial market commentators and practitioners.  Further work is needed to improve the way in which risk appetite is measured, but the preliminary findings reported in the article seem to suggest that risk appetite has been high recently. 6 Financial Stability Review: December 2004 – Financial stability themes and issues Financial stability themes and issues Financial Stability Review December 2004  An overview of UK financial stability:   threats and resilience 9 1 Credit risk 14 Credit risk:  key points 1 4 Introduction 15 1.1 UK household sector credit risks 1 7 1.2 UK corporate credit risks 24 1.3 The United States 29 1.4 Europe 34 1.5 Japan 40 1.6 Emerging market economies 42 2 Risks in the international financial system 49 Risks in the international financial system:  key points 49 2.1 International financial markets 50 2.2 Hedge funds and leverage 57 2.3 Major financial institutions 58 2.4 Implications for the UK financial system 60 3 UK financial sector resilience 65 UK financial sector resilience:  key points 65 3.1 The large UK-owned banking sector 66 3.2 UK non-bank financial sectors 71 3.3 Links between financial institutions 71 The financial stability conjuncture and outlook – Financial Stability Review: December 2004 7 The financial stability conjuncture and outlook  8 Financial Stability Review: December 2004 – The financial stability conjuncture and outlook  The past six months have been a relatively benign period for UK financial stability.  Credit losses suffered by the large UK-owned banks have been small and new provisions have declined (Chart 1).  Nor have there been significant pressures on liquidity or solvency in the international financial system.  In general, asset prices have been less volatile than usual and most major equity markets have risen somewhat. The immediate prospects for both the UK and international financial systems also appear broadly favourable, with major economies unlikely to experience marked falls in growth and yield curves suggesting that sharp increases in borrowers’ interest payments are not anticipated.  Market indicators of credit risk and expected interest rate volatility (Chart 2) are consistent with this near-term outlook. However, financial stability authorities focus on downside risks rather than the most likely outlook, because they attempt to identify potential threats to stability.  In that light, there are three main reasons for vigilance. First, globally, doubts about the sustainability of the current pattern of capital flows have increased, with downward pressure on the US dollar and rising uncertainty about future exchange rate movements – and about their consequences for interest rates, asset prices and activity.  That may affect the market risks faced by financial institutions and, over a longer time horizon, the creditworthiness of borrowers in any countries where growth slows sharply. Second, market indicators may partly reflect a greater appetite for risk.  The intensification of the ‘search for yield’ noted in recent Reviews continues to pose risk management challenges, not least because it may have led some financial institutions to build up positions in what could prove to be relatively illiquid assets. Third, the increase in unsecured debt for many UK households, the rapid rise in lending to the commercial property sector and The financial stability conjuncture and outlook – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 9 The financial stability conjuncture and outlook An overview of UK financial stability: threats and resilience 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 1987 89 91 93 95 97 99 2001 03 Interquartile range Median Percentage of loans Chart 1 Large UK-owned banks’ new provisions for bad and doubtful debts(a) Sources: Thomson Financial Datastream, published accounts and Bank calculations.

Lenders and borrowers may underestimate these vulnerabilities because at the moment the near-term risks seem low. Credit risk and the accumulation of debt The contrast between low near-term risks and heightened longer-term vulnerabilities is evident when the credit risk facing the UK financial sector is considered. Domestic mortgages are the single largest category of exposures of the major UK-owned banks, which have been expanding mortgage lending at a considerably faster rate than the growth in households’ disposable income (Chart 3).  In the near term, given the prospects for incomes and employment, default rates on this lending are likely to remain low.  And banks continue to benefit from substantial collateral, thanks to falls in loan-to-value ratios on new lending (Chart 4) and past rises in house prices. However, unsecured lending has recently been increasing even more rapidly than lending secured on property (although its level remains considerably lower).  It is not clear that credit pricing has taken due account of the upward drift in banks’ write-off rates on unsecured lending (Chart 5);  on the contrary, the spread between the effective interest rate charged and banks’ funding costs has fallen further since the June 2004 Review, perhaps because of increased competition.  Although banks have continued to improve credit-scoring models and stress tests, these techniques have yet to be tested by a period of pronounced economic strain.  If, in such a period, lenders attempted to lower risk by making it much more difficult or expensive for borrowers to roll over their unsecured lending, wider repayment problems might be precipitated. Credit risk from UK companies appears subdued in the near term.  Sterling corporate bond spreads have fallen a little since the June 2004 Review, and estimates of the probability of corporate default have generally declined, reflecting rises in corporate profitability and equity prices in most sectors. Nonetheless, while corporate capital gearing has continued to fall, it remains high by the standards of the past twenty years (although its equilibrium level in a low inflation environment is uncertain).  In contrast to 2002, when firms were repairing balance sheets by cutting back on dividends, lowering capital expenditure and refinancing debt, the recent easing in corporate gearing has largely reflected financial surpluses and the increase in the market value of corporate assets. Over half the new corporate lending in the year to September 2004 was to the commercial property sector 10 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – The financial stability conjuncture and outlook 0 5 10 15 20 25 1999 2000 01 02 03 04 Per cent Mortgage Other unsecured Credit card (a) Chart 3 Annual growth of large UK-owned banks’ lending to individuals Source:  Bank of England.

That raises the issue of whether lenders are sufficiently diversifying their UK corporate credit risk.  Property yields have continued to decline (including relative to other returns), and, in the light of recent weak rental growth and high vacancy rates, it is unclear whether investors’ expectations of rental income will be met. The major UK-owned banks have continued to increase their exposures to other economies.  If the major economies perform in the near term as most forecasters expect, credit risks on these exposures are likely to remain moderate.  World economic growth has been very strong this year and, as a result, there have been few pressures on domestic banking systems.  The picture in the euro area is perhaps less encouraging than elsewhere, given the downward revisions to expectations for GDP growth and concerns about the possible impact of dollar depreciation.  And some parts of the German banking system have been finding it difficult to sustain increases in profitability.  But for most continental European banks, profitability and capital remain satisfactory (Chart 7).  In the United States, the high and increasing indebtedness of the household sector is perhaps of less concern than might first appear, because a much higher proportion of household debt is at low long-term fixed rates than in the United Kingdom.  On the corporate side, the general outlook seems to have improved, but some large, highly indebted companies with big pension and health care liabilities, notably in the airline and automobile industries, still appear to be under strain (Chart 8). As far as the emerging-market economy (EME) exposures of the UK financial system are concerned, despite the rise in oil prices and uncertainty about China’s growth prospects, market confidence in EME credit prospects appears to have strengthened.  Sovereign spreads (Chart 9) have fallen considerably since their peak in autumn 2002, and by more than would be suggested by ratings agencies’ upgrades.  Low funding costs have encouraged strong foreign currency issuance of bonds and syndicated loans this year, especially by EME companies. The international financial system and the ‘search for yield’ In the past six months, the downside risks in the international financial system highlighted in the June 2004 Review have not materialised.  The increases in official US interest rates to date, from their lowest point in over forty years, were well signalled and have not triggered the sharp upward shift in market yield curves that some had feared.  And asset price volatility has been low.  But given this background, it has remained difficult to find investments with the prospective returns that many investors still expect, and so the ‘search for yield’ has been continuing.

BNP Paribas reports assets on a half-yearly basis;  assets are assumed to remain unchanged from previous half-yearly levels in the intervening quarters.  It has taken various forms, including continuing substantial flows of investors’ funds into hedge funds (Chart 10), carry trades of different sorts, the rapid development of more complex structured credit products and the growth of the leveraged loan and high-yield debt markets.  These activities have permitted greater portfolio diversification but have also entailed increases in gearing for some borrowers and more leveraged assets for some investors.  Spreads on corporate debt, especially at the high-yield end, have narrowed further (Chart 1 1), as have those on emerging-market debt, and some debt covenants have been relaxed.  Concerns have arisen that risk may be being underpriced in capital markets, potentially leading to an over- accumulation of risky exposures.  Measures of uncertainty in financial markets suggest a mixture of lower perceived risks in the near term and a greater willingness to take on risk, but in what proportion is unclear.  It is, perhaps, significant that some market contacts have expressed misgivings at the scale of investor demand for risky and potentially illiquid assets. Unexpected economic developments could trigger the attempted simultaneous unwinding of common positions, possibly leading to strains on market liquidity. Many large complex financial institutions (LCFIs)1 are developing new lines of business, in response to the low margins in many well-established financial markets and subdued demand for traditional investment banking services.  For example, structured credit markets are expanding rapidly.  The combination of relative novelty and dependence on complex pricing models poses risks in such markets.  Some LCFIs have reportedly been expanding energy and commodity trading and prime brokerage activity for hedge funds.  Against the backdrop of generally high rates of return on equity (Chart 12) and substantial capital, the risks in the short run to the LCFIs themselves appear to remain low, despite the litigatory challenges that highlight reputational risks that could, if they crystallised, threaten some lines of business.  But, in the longer run, the vulnerability of LCFIs to unexpected market developments, including episodes of illiquidity or dislocation, may be increasing, enhancing the importance of appropriate stress testing and scenario planning. The resilience of the UK financial system Overall, then, the current environment facing the UK financial sector appears favourable, but downside risks remain, particularly in the light of the build-up of debt and the continuing ‘search for yield’ .  If these risks were to crystallise in the near term, the robust profitability and capital of the major UK-owned banks should help to contain any potential systemic impact.  These banks’ return on equity generally increased in the first half of this year, with both cost-income ratios and new 12 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – The financial stability conjuncture and outlook 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 10 AAA AA A BBB BB B Sterling US dollar Euro Basis points Investment-grade Sub-investment-grade - + Chart 11 Changes in credit spreads by rating(a)(b) Sources: Merrill Lynch and Bank calculations.

And reported total and Tier 1 capital ratios rose marginally, remaining well above regulatory minima (Chart 1 3).  The continuing need to fill the gap between customer deposits and lending by raising funds in highly liquid wholesale markets has increased the importance of liquidity management, but the indications are that banks’ liquidity buffers are adequate.  In the financial system outside the banking sector, there are also few signs of stress;  even in the life insurance industry, where pressures remain, profitability has been improving.  However, in the longer term, the falling share of net interest income (Chart 1 4) suggests that the major banks may be increasing their dependence on potentially more volatile sources of income.  And interest margins, particularly on unsecured lending to households, are narrowing. In the light of the longer-term challenges set out above, the use of a wide range of scenarios in banks’ stress tests is desirable, including combinations of possible adverse shocks to profits, credit quality and market liquidity, and the exit of key counterparties from markets.  Quantitative risk modelling is becoming more widespread, which should prove helpful, but such models are largely untested by major periods of stress and may not take full account of feedbacks from the banking system to asset prices and the broader economy. Both prudential regulation and accounting standards must keep pace with financial innovation and its implications for systemic risk.  In the article Strengthening financial infrastructure below, credit risk transfer markets are identified as one area where that is becoming more pressing, and appropriate work is under way. The article also discusses some risks associated with a ‘tiered’ payment structure.  The high-value CHAPS Sterling system has relatively few banks as direct members.  Non-member banks use the CHAPS Sterling system indirectly through correspondent relationships with direct members, thereby potentially increasing inter-bank exposures.  The Bank’s recent proposed reforms to its operations in the sterling money markets should encourage a range of UK banks and building societies, in addition to the current direct members of CHAPS Sterling, to hold reserve accounts at the Bank.  The Bank hopes that some of these institutions, particularly those with significant sterling payment flows, will also choose to become direct members of CHAPS Sterling.  The article also explores whether similar risks arise from clearing and settlement arrangements between direct and indirect participants in other infrastructures important to UK wholesale financial markets – such as CREST, LCH.Clearnet Ltd and the Continuous Linked Settlement System (CLS).  This is an area where the Bank intends to do further work.

Although the immediate prospects for UK financial stability are broadly favourable, some areas of longer-term vulnerability remain as a result of which credit risks could rise significantly if the macroeconomic environment were to weaken: ● The continuing rapid growth in debt means that the UK household sector has become increasingly sensitive to any adverse shocks to employment income.  Given the MPC’s central forecast for output growth over the next two years, benign labour market conditions are likely to limit pressures on debt servicing.  But if the macroeconomic outlook were to become significantly weaker, credit risks might increase, particularly on unsecured debt; ● The non-financial corporate sector remains, in aggregate, profitable and able to weather the consequences of sudden shocks (such as the sharp rise in the price of oil).  Nevertheless, capital gearing remains high, suggesting that firms are more vulnerable to unfavourable events than on average over the past.  Pension fund deficits have continued to contribute to financial pressures for some firms, and there are signs that financial strength may not extend across the whole of the corporate sector – a significant number of (mainly smaller) firms made operating losses during 2003.  Banks’ recent domestic corporate lending has been highly concentrated in the commercial real estate sector, where property yields have continued to decline, and it is possible that some investors may have underestimated the risks associated with this lending; ● Debt-servicing difficulties arising overseas may place pressures on the UK financial system through the significant international exposures of UK-owned banks.  The economic outlook in the major overseas economies is largely favourable, although higher oil prices and downward revisions in forecasts for GDP growth in 2005 in the United States and Europe could contribute to weaknesses in some balance sheets – for instance, there is some evidence of fragility in the aviation and motor industries.  Household debt-to-income ratios have also risen in the United States and parts of continental Europe, increasing households’ vulnerability to adverse shocks in these countries.  In the event of further rises in the price of oil, higher world interest rates or a sharper-than-expected slowdown in economic activity in China, there is a risk that the economic outlook for emerging market economies (EMEs) could also weaken, though market confidence in EME credit prospects appears to have strengthened and central forecasts for global growth are still favourable. The UK banking system remains well placed in the face of these credit risks.  Mortgage arrears continue to decline and loan-to-value ratios on new mortgages have been reduced further since the June 2004 Review.  Unsecured lending to UK households and lending to the UK corporate sector, both of which appear somewhat riskier than mortgage lending, still only constitute a relatively small part of UK banks’ lending activities.  Risks from international credit exposures also appear moderate.  But there remains the possibility that lenders and borrowers may be underestimating the longer-term vulnerabilities highlighted above, at a time when the immediate operating environment appears benign.  1 Credit risk On-balance-sheet credit risk is a key part of any assessment of the risks to UK financial stability, given the size of the financial sector’s exposures to household, corporate and sovereign borrowers (see Box 1).  New provisions set aside by the large UK-owned banks against bad and doubtful debts have remained low (Chart 1.1).  Most other major banking systems have also been benefiting from relatively low losses on their lending portfolios, as the later sections of this chapter illustrate. The recent low level of banks’ provisions reflects the favourable macroeconomic environment, which has lowered credit risk by boosting households’ income and raising corporate profits.1 Output growth is expected to be robust in the large UK-owned banks’ major markets in 2004,2 and to be slightly stronger than had generally been anticipated at the time of the June 2004 Review (Chart 1.2). Credit risk has also been affected by the unexpected rise in the oil price (Chart 1.3).  As discussed in the August and November Inflation Reports, the aggregate impact of oil price increases on firms’ costs and profitability, and world output growth, is unlikely to be as great as that of the 1 970s oil price shocks;  in real terms, prices are lower and the oil intensity of production in OECD countries has fallen.  However, higher oil and commodity prices may affect the distribution of credit risk across both companies and countries.  For example, higher oil prices may benefit a small number of oil-producing countries, while reducing the incomes of a larger number of net oil importers (see Chapter 1.6). UK and US short-term interest rates rose in 2004;  this might have increased the pressures on some borrowers, despite the pickup in growth.  But past experience suggests that a given change in the level of interest rates tends to have a smaller impact on UK banks’ provisions than a similar change in output growth,3 and the debt-servicing burden for many borrowers has been lightened by the low level of short-term interest rates in large UK-owned banks’ major markets.  Short-term interest rate expectations for 2005 in the United Kingdom, United States and euro area have all fallen since the June 2004 Review.  And, in the case of the United Kingdom, market participants now expect short-term rates to remain broadly unchanged.  Ten-year US-dollar, euro and sterling government bond yields have all fallen since the June 2004 Review.

Market indicators point to lower corporate credit risk.  With the exception of Japan, equity indices in the major industrial economies have increased over the past six months.  Credit default swap premia have mainly fallen since the June 2004 Review and corporate bond spreads have declined (Chart 1.4), with the improvements greatest for sub-investment-grade companies and borrowers in emerging markets.  Although that may partly reflect investors’ higher risk appetite (see Chapter 2), corporate bond default rates have declined, suggesting that there has been some improvement in fundamentals.  Rating agency assessments have pointed in the same direction, with upgrades outnumbering downgrades over the period.  The remainder of this chapter considers the major factors affecting near-term credit risk. 16 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – The financial stability conjuncture and outlook While more than 400 banks and building societies operate in the United Kingdom, ten large banking groups undertake the majority of UK households’ and companies’ banking activities (Chart A).  The ten largest banking groups by total assets are: Abbey, Alliance & Leicester, Barclays, Bradford & Bingley, HBOS, HSBC Holdings, Lloyds TSB, Northern Rock, RBS Group and Standard Chartered.  Throughout this Review, these banks are described as the large UK-owned banking sector.  Unless otherwise stated, charts include data for these banking groups’ subsidiaries prior to merger or acquisition, while figures for demutualised building societies are included from the date that data became available. By type of borrower, households and non-financial companies in the United Kingdom and abroad together constitute the major part of the large UK-owned banking sector’s collective on-balance-sheet exposures (Chart B).  Overseas exposures account for around 40% of the total assets of the sector, although there is considerable variation across institutions.  Foreign claims have increased in recent years through acquisitions by UK-owned banks of foreign financial institutions, especially in the United States.  Since the June 2004 Review, cross-border links have been further strengthened by the Spanish-owned bank, Banco Santander, acquiring the sixth largest UK-owned bank by total assets, Abbey, in November.1 Box 1:  The large UK-owned banking sector (1) Abbey has been retained in the peer group of large UK-owned banks used in this Review, given that the acquisition occurred after the period of the latest financial results (2004 H1).

On average, it makes up around 76% of their loans to UK-resident households and private non-financial companies, and 23% of their total assets.  Any assessment of the risks to banks from the household sector needs to consider both the nature of banks’ exposures to the sector and the extent of financial pressures on households. The exposures of large UK-owned banks Secured lending The annual growth of large UK-owned banks’ mortgage lending remained rapid in 2004 H1 (Chart 1.5).  At around 10%, it considerably exceeded the growth rate of nominal GDP .  Since mid-year, there has been a slowdown in mortgage lending for house purchase.  Buy-to-let lending has continued to grow particularly quickly, but nevertheless still makes up only 7% of aggregate mortgage exposures.1 Unsecured lending The large UK-owned banking sector’s unsecured lending has continued to grow even faster than their secured lending during the second half of 2004 (Chart 1.5).  Despite its faster rate of growth, unsecured lending still makes up only 1 8% of large UK-owned banks’ lending to UK-resident individuals (Chart 1.6). Nevertheless, with growth rates exceeding those for secured lending for the past five years, unsecured lending to UK households is becoming a more substantial proportion of the large UK-owned banking sector’s exposures.  Given that many characteristics (such as loss given default, ‘draw-down’ behaviour and pricing) of unsecured lending are different to those of secured lending, the risk management challenges facing banks are also gradually changing. Financial pressures on households Growth of debt Households’ total borrowing from all banks and other lenders has increased even more rapidly than their borrowing from the large UK-owned banks.  Total borrowing growth has remained close to an annual rate of 1 5% this year (Chart 1.7), raising households’ debt to 1 40% of aggregate income (Chart 1.8).  This is above the levels in the United States and most large European countries.  But whether this leaves UK households more vulnerable than elsewhere to future adverse shocks depends on how debt is distributed in different countries across households  The financial stability conjuncture and outlook – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 17 (1) See ‘Box 1:  The buy-to-let mortgage market’ in the June 2004 Review, page 20. 5.9% 82.0% 12.1% Residential mortgages Credit card lending Other unsecured lending Chart 1.6 Large UK-owned banks’ stock of lending to UK individuals(a) Sources:  Bank of England and published accounts.

Aggregate debt would also be increased if the upward trend in the number of mortgage borrowers continues.  In the past few years, this increase has mainly reflected the rising number, and smaller average size, of households.3 In aggregate, the growth of debt has been accompanied by an increase in financial assets, reflecting both gross saving and equity price gains.  However, these assets are unlikely to be available to the most vulnerable households, as they tend only to have a small amount of financial wealth.4 Debt affordability Income gearing, which provides an indication of the burden faced by the household sector as a whole in servicing its debt, picked up modestly during the first half of 2004 (Chart 1.9). Households’ average effective borrowing rate increased further in Q3, reflecting the latest interest rate changes.  This is likely to have caused a further rise in gearing. The increase in mortgage interest repayments is likely to have been more abrupt for those households for whom short-term fixed-rate mortgage contracts have recently expired.5 The current average standard variable rate is about two percentage points higher than the average two-year fixed-rate product that was available two years ago.  Given market expectations for interest rates, a household whose fixed-rate mortgage contract expires over the next year is also likely to experience a mortgage rate increase.  Similarly, the interest rate on some households’ ‘annual review mortgages’ may increase on the next review date. 18 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) Higher aggregate debt can also signal an improvement in welfare.  Households may have been able to maintain consumption during temporary periods of lower income, or to match expectations of higher future income.  Or they may have been able to use debt to purchase expensive durable goods and housing.  See Hancock, M and Wood, R (2004), ‘Household secured debt’ , Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Autumn. (2) Slow adjustment occurs because only a relatively small proportion (averaging 10% over the past thirty years) of the housing stock changes hands each year.  See Hamilton, R (2003), ‘Trends in households’ secured debt’ , Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Autumn. (3) The increase in the number of households is likely to have raised the aggregate level of debt because there has been no offsetting reduction in the average dwelling (and thus, potentially, mortgage) size. (4) See Cox, P , Whitley, J and Brierley, P (2002), ‘Financial pressures in the UK household sector:  evidence from the British Household Panel Survey’ , Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Winter. (5) In 2002, 23% of new mortgages were taken out at a fixed interest rate, with this proportion rising to 36% in 2003. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 1988 90 92 94 96 98 2000 02 04 Per cent Chart 1.8 Ratio of household sector debt to income(a)(b)(c) Sources:  ONS and Bank calculations.

(a) Dashed lines indicate averages from 1 988 Q1 to 2004 Q2.  Changes in aggregate default risk also depend on changes in the repayment difficulties associated with a given level of income gearing.  As discussed in Box 2, the proportion of households reporting mortgage payment problems has fallen by about two thirds since the early 1 990s, largely because households are less likely to report a problem for a given level of mortgage payments relative to income. Income and unemployment Previous research has found that income shocks were the largest single determinant of household debt difficulties in the early 1 990s.1 So it is reassuring that labour market conditions remain benign.  Whole-economy earnings grew by 3.7% in the year to 2004 Q3.  Unemployment is low, at only about half its early 1 990s level (Chart 1.10).  And inflows into unemployment have also fallen, reducing the number of households experiencing a sudden loss of employment income.  As discussed in the November Inflation Report (page 41), the MPC expects the employment rate to increase marginally over the next two years, with wage growth probably rising. House prices The increase in house prices in recent years has strengthened the financial position of many homeowners by increasing their capacity to refinance debts.2 Reflecting this, a recent survey3 found that 40% of mortgage holders agreed with the statement, “My house value has risen so much that I do not worry about other debts I may have” .  Over half those sampled had remortgaged, with a number of these having taken the opportunity to consolidate other debts.  Overall, 56% of households reported looking to save money on monthly payments when remortgaging. As discussed in the November Inflation Report (pages 6–7), the outlook for house prices remains uncertain.  Any sustained fall in prices would reduce homeowners’ cushion of housing equity. This might reduce their opportunity to remortgage to consolidate other debts or to lower their monthly payments. Financing difficulties would be exacerbated if any fall in house prices were accompanied by a wider economic slowdown, although the MPC’s November central projection is for output growth to be close to trend.  Any fall in house prices might also increase the financial pressures associated with buy-to-let borrowing if it were accompanied by a reduction in rental values.

First, households with higher gearing are more likely to report payment problems;  in 2004, households with gearing over 25% of income were about twice as likely to report problems as those with lower gearing.  Second, over the past decade, households have become less likely to report payment problems for any given level of gearing.  This reduction has been particularly pronounced at high gearing levels. Shift-share analysis4 reveals that the reduction in the proportion of households reporting problems between 1 991 and 1 993 was largely due to the decline in the fraction of households with high gearing (Chart C), reflecting the reduction in interest rates. In contrast, the (larger) reduction in mortgage payment problems since 1 993 is more than accounted for by households being much less likely to report problems for any given level of income gearing.  Over this time, the distribution of gearing across households has changed relatively little, while there is now less difference in the proportion of reported payment problems among households with different gearing levels. Households’ greater tolerance of a given level of mortgage income gearing may be associated with a number of factors, including:  steady economic and wage growth;  the fall in unemployment (and inflows into unemployment);  lower and less volatile nominal interest rates and inflation;  and the increase in house prices which (for most homeowners) has raised housing equity.  Of course, should some of these factors change, the burden of debt might increase. Box 2:  Households’ perception of their mortgage burden (1) Data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) for 1 991 to 2002, and a special survey commissioned by the Bank and conducted by NMG Research in September 2004.

Personal insolvencies Personal insolvencies have continued to rise this year, and are now above their early 1 990s level (Chart 1.1 1), despite a fall in bankruptcies amongst the self-employed (which probably reflects the benign business environment discussed in Chapter 1.2). Although unemployment has fallen substantially since the early 1 990s (and there has been no increase in inactivity), the unemployed and inactive now account for twice as many bankruptcies as they did in the early 1 990s.  Any future pickup in unemployment might therefore be accompanied by a larger increase in the overall personal insolvency rate than it would have done in the past. The rise in insolvencies has largely reflected an increase in debtor, rather than creditor, petitions for bankruptcy (Chart 1.12).  This may have been partly due to the implementation of the Enterprise Act (2002) on 1 April 2004,1 which changed the penalties associated with most bankruptcies in England and Wales.  But that seems unlikely to be the whole story;  these penalties remain high and there has been a similar increase in insolvencies in Scotland over the past few years, where the legal regime has remained unchanged (Chart 1.1 3). Risks to large UK-owned banks Secured lending Backward-looking indicators continue to show little sign of stress on the UK-owned banking sector’s secured lending.  New provisions for bad and doubtful debts, for example, at around 0.35% of total loans, remain low, which is broadly consistent with what might have been expected given the macroeconomic environment.2 Mortgage arrears and write-offs remain at or near historical lows (Chart 1.1 4).  And while mortgage possessions have increased in recent months, this has been from a low base.3 Forward-looking indicators of risk, such as spreads on mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and demand for MBS issues, show little sign of investor concern.  However, these indicators should be interpreted with caution, given that spreads on MBS can be influenced by factors other than the underlying quality of the assets, such as the way in which the issue has been structured.  Lack of secondary market liquidity means that it is difficult to monitor developments in MBS spreads. The financial stability conjuncture and outlook – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 21 (1) The Enterprise Act reduced the period for automatic discharge of most bankrupts, while increasing it for those whose conduct is deemed to have been irresponsible or reckless. (2) Based on the simple model in Hoggarth, G and Pain, D (2002), ‘Bank provisioning:  the UK experience’ , Bank of England Financial Stability Review, June. (3) The increase in possession orders may be associated with recent changes to bankruptcy legislation that have limited the period in which a bankrupt’s home may be possessed to three years.

(b) The timing of insolvencies in the early 1 990s may have been distorted by the introduction of the Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act in Apr. 1 993.  Even were defaults to rise, large UK-owned banks would not necessarily face material losses, because mortgage lending is backed by collateral.  Average loan-to-value (LTV) ratios on new lending continued to fall during 2004 H1, and are now considerably lower than in the late 1 980s (Chart 1.1 5).  The mean and distribution of LTV ratios on the total outstanding mortgage stock are less easy to measure, though they are a more appropriate indicator of the risk to banks.  Many large UK-owned banks report mean LTV ratios in their published accounts, and these tend to be in the region of 40 to 50%.  This accords with a special survey of households commissioned by the Bank and conducted by NMG Research in September 2004, in which 45% of mortgage debt was held by households where the current LTV was 50% or above, and 1 6% of mortgage debt where the LTV was 70% or above.  LTV ratios on mortgage portfolios should, however, be interpreted with some caution.  In a scenario where there was a market-wide fall in the value of housing collateral, any widespread attempt by banks to realise its value could put further downward pressure on house prices. The risk of loss to banks will be greater if mortgage lending with high LTV ratios has been concentrated amongst borrowers under financial pressure.  In processing information from a sample of lenders, the FSA tracks and categorises new mortgage lending with both high LTV ratios and high loan-to-income (LTI) ratios – the latter being one indicator of financial pressure on households (Chart 1.1 6).  In 2004 Q2, the proportion of new lending falling into the combined medium and higher risk categories had moved a little ahead of the fairly narrow range within which it had fluctuated over the past couple of years. However, over a longer horizon, evidence from the Survey of Mortgage Lenders and The British Household Panel Survey suggests that in recent years fewer households than in the late 1 980s have high debt repayment commitments but little collateral to offer.1 Unsecured lending Unsecured lending is always likely to incur proportionally higher loss given default than is secured lending, given the absence of collateral or guarantees.  Indeed, although unsecured lending makes up only 1 8% of large UK-owned banks’ lending to UK-resident individuals, it has been responsible for 93% of write-offs on such lending in the past seven years (Chart 1.17). However, the overall profitability of banks’ unsecured lending depends on whether the risks they face have been reflected in the interest rates and fees charged to borrowers. 22 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) Hancock, M and Wood, R (2004), ‘Household secured debt’ , Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Autumn. 0 20 40 60 80 100 1988 90 92 94 96 98 2000 02 04 Less than 1 1 to 1.99 2 to 2.99 3 to 3.99 4 and above Per cent Chart 1.16 Loan-to-income multiples on new UK mortgage advances(a) Source:  Council of Mortgage Lenders.

(b) Adjusted to reflect one bank’s change in accounting method.  The spread between effective interest rates on unsecured lending and banks’ cost of funds has continued to fall since the June 2004 Review (Chart 1.1 8).  Market contacts attribute this to strong competition between unsecured lenders, illustrated by the increase in zero-interest credit card offers (Chart 1.1 9).1 The downward trend in unsecured lending spreads should, however, be interpreted with caution.  The average level of effective interest rates on credit cards, for example, still remains high relative to that on secured lending.  Furthermore, some unsecured lending, such as personal loans, is undertaken in conjunction with fee income. Credit losses from unsecured lending have increased marginally since the previous Review.  Annual write-off rates on credit cards rose to 3% in 2004 Q3, while rates on other unsecured lending rose to 2.1% (Chart 1.20).  Some of the rise in write-offs on credit cards could be associated with the recent increase in personal insolvencies discussed above.  However, bank contacts suggest that only around 5 to 20% of write-offs are related to bankruptcy, so that may only provide a part of the explanation. Despite their recent rise, write-off rates on large UK-owned banks’ unsecured lending still remain below rates in some other countries, such as the United States and Hong Kong. Looking forward, banks face a number of risk management challenges.  One is managing the transition to the new personal insolvency law regime, which could have a long-lasting effect if it changes debtor behaviour and thus the sensitivity of write-offs to adverse macroeconomic shocks.  Another is managing the implications of the strong growth in unsecured lending over the past five years (Chart 1.5), especially where this has occurred through lending to new customers for whom the bank has no past current account information with which to supplement a credit assessment.  Lending to customers with multiple borrowing relationships may also pose a challenge when the bank does not have complete information about the evolution of a customer’s total indebtedness over time. Banks have been undertaking measures to strengthen their risk management in the face of such problems, for example, by studying the impact of changes in insolvency regimes in other jurisdictions, such as Australia and Hong Kong.  Most UK banks already share some indicators of adverse credit history with other lenders, which helps address the challenge posed by multiple borrower relationships.  Contacts suggest that indicators that confirm borrowers have a history of timely repayment could be shared more freely in future.  In part encouraged by the introduction of Basel II, banks have also been developing their quantitative risk modelling techniques over recent years, The financial stability conjuncture and outlook – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 23 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 1999 2000 01 02 03 04 (c) Per cent Credit cards(c) Overdrafts Personal loans Mortgages Chart 1.18 The large UK-owned banking sector’s effective interest rate spread over Libor(a)(b) Source:  Bank of England.

Many of these models, however, are yet to be tested by a period of actual economic stress. If credit quality were to deteriorate, one response by banks could be to reduce their exposure to unsecured lending, by either cutting back on new lending or by raising interest margins. Although reducing lending could be an effective strategy for some individual banks, simultaneous action could exacerbate pressures on both borrowers and lenders. 1.2 UK corporate credit risks Large UK-owned banks’ lending to private non-financial companies (PNFC) represents around 8% of their total assets. Although lending to this sector accounts for only 24% of lending to UK-resident households and PNFCs, it has accounted for 35% of total domestic write-offs since 1 997 .  Furthermore, over the past five years the volatility of write-off rates on lending to this sector has been higher than that for lending to individuals.  Any evaluation of risks to banks from non-financial companies, as with risks from the household sector, will depend on both the nature of banks’ exposures and the extent of financial pressures on the sector. Exposures of large UK-owned banks The growth of large UK-owned banks’ new lending to UK non-financial companies increased to around 12% in the year to 2003 Q3.  There has been considerable dispersion in growth across sectors:  for example, the annual growth rate of lending to real estate companies is still rapid, at 20%, while that of lending to other non-financial companies is 8% (Chart 1.2 1). Lending to real estate companies accounted for 55% of large UK-owned banks’ new lending to non-financial companies in the year to September 2004, following a 65% contribution in 2003.  As a result, this sub-sector now makes up around 35% of the stock of large UK-owned banks’ lending to non-financial companies.  This compares with around 10% for the manufacturing sector, for example (Chart 1.22). Financial pressures on companies Aggregate profitability Corporate profitability continued to pick up over the first half of 2004.  This partly reflected strong profits from UK Continental Shelf companies (oil producers), due to high oil prices.  But average profitability amongst other companies also rose, with the net rate of return on capital remaining above its long-run average (Chart 1.23).  Although positive, the mean expectation of profit 24 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – The financial stability conjuncture and outlook 0 20 40 60 80 100 1997 98 99 2000 01 02 03 04 Other non-financial companies Transport, storage, communication Construction Manufacturing Real estate companies Per cent Chart 1.22 Large UK-owned banks’ stock of lending to non-financial companies Source:  Bank of England. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 1989 91 93 95 97 99 2001 03 Per cent Service sector Manufacturing sector All non-continental-shelf PNFCs Chart 1.23 Net rate of return on capital(a)(b) Source:  ONS.

The strength of profits helped the corporate sector remain in financial surplus for the eighth successive quarter in 2004 Q2. Reflecting this, PNFCs’ demand for external finance has been relatively weak for most of this time (Chart 1.24).  Bank borrowing picked up in 2004 Q3, although bond issuance remained weak and there was a net repurchase of equity. Disaggregated measures of profitability Credit risk also depends on the distribution of profitability across firms, and whether there are any pockets of unusually high vulnerability.  Data from UK companies’ accounts reveal that the dispersion of quoted companies’ profit margins has increased over much of the past twenty years (Chart 1.25).  In 2003, 38% of quoted companies made a loss – similar to the rates in 2002 and 2001, but substantially above those prior to 1 999 (Chart 1.26).  But these are primarily small companies, accounting for about 1 4% of quoted non-financial companies’ debt.  And if non-quoted companies are also considered, the proportion of companies making a loss is close to its average since 1 991.  Also reassuring is that the proportion of firms that have reported so far in 2004 that made losses is fractionally lower than in 2003,1 while profit warnings this year have been running a little below their levels over the previous three years. Since the start of the year, movements in the FTSE All-Share index have only been weakly correlated with oil price changes. However, rising oil and commodities prices are likely to have had a more marked effect on some companies than others.  For example, increased fuel costs have affected airlines, the share prices of which have fallen over the year to date. Capital gearing and balance sheet adjustment The ratio of companies’ debt to the market value of their assets – a measure of capital gearing – provides an aggregate indicator of the sustainability of their balance sheet position.  Gearing has continued to ease in 2004 (Chart 1.27), reflecting the small fall in net debt and the increase in market values.  However, by historical standards, gearing remains high and is also above the estimated ‘equilibrium level’ calculated in a recent Bank working paper.2 The financial stability conjuncture and outlook – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 25 (1) Based on the results from 401 quoted companies that have so far published accounts for 2004, about a third of the final sample. (2) The equilibrium level is calculated by offsetting the tax advantages of debt finance against the costs to the firm of financial stress, which becomes more likely at higher levels of debt.

(c) Sample includes all public quoted companies and private limited companies with over 100 employees.  There is little evidence that many firms are actively seeking to reduce gearing further by making cutbacks in dividends, lowering capital expenditure or refinancing debt.  Although average dividend payments relative to GDP in the first half of 2004 were fairly low by historical standards (particularly given the strength of corporate profitability), the fraction of highly geared quoted companies cutting their dividend fell in both 2002 and 2003.  Capital expenditure has recently been robust, growing by an average of 1.9% over the past three quarters.  And, rather than repaying debt, there was a net buy-back of equities in 2004 Q3. Consistent with this overall picture, the 2004 Q3 Institute of Directors survey revealed that a net balance of only 6% of companies believed that their gearing was too high.  There also appears to be little pressure to reduce gearing from investors;  on the contrary, corporate contacts suggest that there has been a rising appetite for debt relative to equity. Pension fund deficits have continued to add to financial pressures for some companies.  Adding these deficits to traditional balance sheet exposures increases the aggregate debt of FTSE 100 companies with defined-benefit pension schemes by 6%.1 The size of these deficits has remained little changed over both the past year and since the June 2004 Review, as favourable equity price movements have been offset by upward revaluations to liabilities (reflecting a slight fall in the long-term interest rate used to discount future payments and an upward reassessment of life expectancy). Debt servicing High profitability, together with low average borrowing rates, has ensured that aggregate corporate income gearing remains relatively low (Chart 1.28).  Liquidity ratios are at a record high (Chart 1.29), indicating that in aggregate companies have a significant buffer against any future adverse shocks.  However, discussions with companies over the past year have suggested that liquidity may in some cases be higher than desired in the long run, reflecting the expense of repaying long-term borrowing, the lack of suitable investment opportunities or precautionary motives. Market contacts have highlighted the increasing number of highly leveraged buyouts involving private equity firms.  Given the current benign conditions, it is possible that some firms have underestimated the risks of high leverage.  If so, that could cause some such deals to come under strain and thus possibly lead to a rise in debt restructuring. 26 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) Bank of England calculations as at 1 November 2004. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 1990 92 94 96 98 02 04 Per cent Net debt/capital stock (replacement cost measure)(a) Net debt/capital stock (market valuation measure)(b) 2001 Chart 1.27 PNFCs’ capital gearing Sources:  ONS and Bank calculations.

Market contacts report that, in addition to reflecting the robust profitability of the corporate sector, this may also reflect an increased willingness of financial institutions to maintain credit to distressed firms. The number of receiverships has declined in 2004, which could suggest that insolvencies will fall further.1 However, this has been accompanied by an increase in administrations (Chart 1.3 1).  The divergence between the two may partly reflect measures introduced by the 2002 Enterprise Act, which made it easier for firms in financial difficulties to enter administration. Although one aim of the Act was to provide incentives to maintain companies as going concerns, and to avoid unnecessary insolvencies, the increase in administrations over the past year is too small to explain much of the overall fall in insolvencies.  For companies that remain solvent, administrations may nevertheless ultimately lead to write-downs of debt by banks. Market indicators of corporate prospects remain benign. Corporate bond spreads are low by historical standards.  Equity prices have, in general, risen, both since the June 2004 Review and over the past year, and the dispersion in the distribution of equity returns for FTSE 350 companies is lower than on average, with significantly fewer companies suffering heavy equity price falls.  Reflecting these positive developments, the likelihood of corporate default over a twelve-month horizon (as measured by models based upon leverage, equity prices and volatilities2) has declined further during 2004. The commercial property sector Commercial property companies’ demand for finance remains strong.  Their total borrowing from all UK banks grew by 17% in the year to 2004 Q3, unchanged from the previous quarter.3 This finance has partly been used to fund the purchase of property assets from companies, who subsequently lease them back (‘sale and lease back’).  The risks associated with this debt may be low if it is secured against the rental stream from good quality tenants.  Nevertheless, quoted commercial property companies’ capital gearing has increased over the past ten years, although it remains below the early 1 990s high. Strong investor demand continues to put upward pressure on commercial property prices.  Market contacts argue that this has partly reflected better returns than from equities over the past The financial stability conjuncture and outlook – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 27 (1) Receiverships and Company Voluntary Arrangements turn into insolvencies if companies undergoing those proceedings fall into liquidation.

Reassuringly, and in contrast to the early 90s, this demand has not translated into a high level of speculative, unlet, development. Given recent weak rental growth and high vacancy rates, the increase in commercial property capital values has been accompanied by a reduction in yields (Chart 1.32), reducing the spread over money-market rates.  Some lenders may have underestimated the risks associated with these loans:  surveys point to a weakening in PNFCs’ profits growth in 2005 and it is possible that investors’ expectations of rental income and vacancy levels will not be met. Risks to banks Consistent with the fall in corporate insolvencies, the write-off rate on UK-resident banks’ lending to PNFCs has fallen slightly since the June 2004 Review (Chart 1.33).  According to the Finance Leasing Association, the fraction of balances in arrears has fallen during 2003 and 2004, suggesting that future write-offs may remain moderate. Although backward-looking indicators show little sign of recent deterioration, increased concentration of lending to non-financial companies raises challenges for the future (Chart 1.34).  In particular, lending to real estate companies accounts for a third of the large UK-owned banks’ stock of lending to non-financial companies, compared with a fifth in 2000.  This lending has also become increasingly concentrated amongst a small number of banks (Chart 1.34). Commercial property lending provides little immediate cause for concern.  Write-offs and arrears on existing lending in 2003 remained very low.  And loan-to-value ratios on bank lending for new developments remained little changed between 2000 and 2003, at around 80%.  The strength of ‘sale and lease back’ activity means that some of the growth in lending to real estate companies could merely have replaced lending to other types of non-financial companies.  However, in some cases, banks may have credit exposures to both real estate companies and the corporate borrowers that are tenants.  Also, the risks associated with unsecured lending to companies that have used property assets as collateral for other borrowing may have increased. Although the demand for commercial property investments is strong at present, any future fall in capital values could lead to breaches of loan-to-value covenants.  That would reduce the degree of protection for banks’ loans, although, in the absence of corporate defaults, losses may not crystallise. 28 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – The financial stability conjuncture and outlook 0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1999 2000 01 02 03 04 Per cent Private non-financial companies Individuals Other financial companies(a) - + Chart 1.33 UK-resident banks’ annualised write-off rates on domestic lending Source:  Bank of England.

By end-June 2004, claims1 on the United States accounted for over an eighth of the assets of the large UK-owned banks, mostly via US branches and subsidiaries.  US business is particularly important for Barclays, HBSC and the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), accounting for around a fifth of their total assets. Developments in the US household sector, in particular, are potentially important for the UK financial system.  HSBC has a major presence in the US residential mortgage and credit card markets;  while the completion in August of the acquisition of Charter One, a large US regional bank, further increased the importance to RBS of the US residential mortgage and unsecured consumer loan markets.  By contrast, Barclays undertakes little lending to US households or companies, focusing its US operations on investment banking.  More generally, developments in the US economy and financial sector are also important for UK financial stability because large US banks are major counterparties for the large UK-owned banks in both interbank and derivative markets. US growth was slightly weaker than expected in 2004 Q2 and Q3, and Consensus forecasts for real GDP growth in both 2004 and 2005 have been revised down since the previous Review. Nevertheless, the recovery is expected to remain robust, which is likely to help US borrowers to continue to service their loans. Since the June 2004 Review, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has raised the Fed Funds rate by 100 basis points, but long-term interest rates have fallen by 60 basis points and there have been downward revisions to the expected path of official interest rates. The private non-financial sector The household sector Household debt has continued to grow faster than disposable income, resulting in a further rise in the aggregate debt-to-income ratio (Chart 1.35).  The growth in mortgage debt has remained rapid despite slowing somewhat in 2004 Q2. Home equity lending, particularly home equity lines of credit, continued to grow extremely rapidly, perhaps partly in response to the substantial rise in house prices over the past few years (Box 3).  The growth of consumer credit has been fairly subdued since 2002, at least partly because of the high level of mortgage refinancing activity in the first half of 2003 (Chart 1.36). Although the household debt-to-income ratio is relatively high, the ratio of net worth to income is still higher than its average level in the 1 990s.

The growth may partly reflect the fact that house prices have risen by over one third over the past four years.  The particularly rapid growth since 2003 Q3 may also be associated with a sharp decline in mortgage refinancing in the second half of 2003. Home equity loans can be divided into two types.  The first is the traditional second mortgage (TSM), with a fixed sum repayable over a fixed period.  The second is a home equity line of credit (HELOC), which is a revolving credit line secured by housing.  A HELOC plan specifies a credit limit, a repayment schedule and interest charges.  The interest charges are typically at variable rates. HELOCs have grown significantly since 1 999.  The amount of HELOCs drawn on commercial banks and savings institutions1 has grown from 1.8% of personal disposable income to 4.9%.  In that period, the TSMs of these institutions fell relative to personal disposable income.  Given that HELOCS typically have variable rates, this may have increased somewhat the vulnerability of households to interest rate rises. However, the 1 997 Federal Reserve ‘Survey of Consumers’ found that homeowners with HELOCs have a relatively high median household income and median home equity – higher than homeowners with TSMs or homeowners with first mortgages. Moreover, despite the sharp growth in HELOC lending since the survey, charge-off rates on HELOCs have remained relatively stable.2 These remain significantly below charge-off rates on credit cards, on other consumer debt and on TSMs.  Finally, despite the rapid growth, outstanding home equity lending is still only 12% of that of first mortgages. (Table 1) gives the outstanding HELOCs of the largest ten HELOC lenders (these account for over half of the total HELOC lending by commercial banks), as well as the outstanding HELOCs of HSBC North America.  There is considerable variability in holdings relative to total loans.  HSBC North America has low holdings of HELOCs relative to total loans, while the holdings of Citizens Financial, owned by RBS, are above the industry average. Box 3:  Home equity lending in the United States (1) Commercial banks and savings institutions hold 68% of total home equity loans. (2) However, the rapid growth in HELOCs may have reduced the average age of the stock of HELOCs, reducing average charge-off rates for a while. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1991 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 2000 01 02 03 04 Home equity lines of credit Traditional second mortgages Percentage of personal disposable income Chart A US banks and savings institutions:  home equity credit Sources: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System:   ‘Flow of Funds Accounts of the United States’ , 2004 Q2, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Bank calculations and Thomson Financial Datastream.

In large part, this reflects the reductions in average effective interest rates achieved through mortgage refinancing.1 Another factor has been the use of mortgage refinancing and home equity loans and lines of credit to pay down higher-cost unsecured debt. The preponderance of long-term fixed-rate mortgages means that households’ debt service costs are much less sensitive to rises in short or long-term interest rates than in the United Kingdom. Although there has been a marked shift recently to adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs)2 (Chart 1.38), around 85 to 90% of outstanding mortgages are still long-term fixed-rate loans. Unsecured consumer debt accounts for about 20% of household debt.  Its largest component is instalment loans (for example, student loans and car loans), which typically have fixed rates; credit card debt, with variable rates, is significantly smaller. Charge-off rates on mortgages and home equity lending remain low (Chart 1.39).  This is not surprising given that mortgage debt is largely insulated from the direct effect of rising interest rates;  that the financial obligations ratio of home owners has been broadly stable;  and that the unemployment rate has fallen. Although the financial position of renters has improved over the past two years, the financial obligations ratio of this group remains much higher than for home owners.  Charge-off rates on credit cards and other consumer lending are substantially higher than for mortgages but have levelled off recently, mirroring the trend in personal bankruptcies. Only a quarter of first-lien mortgages are originated with loan-to-value ratios (LTV) of more than 80%, and the average LTV for outstanding mortgages is about 45%.  This significant equity cushion would provide protection for lenders against all but the most extreme declines in house prices.  House price increases have been above average for the past four years, with the annual rate of house price inflation reaching 9.4% in 2004 Q2, the highest for almost 25 years. The non-financial corporate sector Corporate capital gearing at replacement cost3 continued to fall in 2004 Q2, as did income gearing (Chart 1.40) – both to their lowest levels for five years.  This partly reflects strong profit growth in 2003 and continued robustness of profits in 2004. The financial stability conjuncture and outlook – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 31 (1) Home owners who refinanced in 2001 and the first half of 2002 achieved an average reduction in mortgage rate of 1.83 percentage points. (2) ARMs are similar to UK fixed-rate mortgages, with the interest rate fixed for an initial period – usually five or seven years – before switching to a variable rate.

Debt growth was sluggish in 2004 Q2, with net issuance of bonds falling sharply.  However the stock of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans grew for the first quarter since 2000 and continued to do so in the third quarter.  Recent Senior Loan Officer surveys suggest that this reflected both supply and demand factors.  Banks have been easing C&I lending standards and corporate loan demand has been increasing since the beginning of this year (Chart 1.41). Data from firms’ accounts suggest that capital gearing, as measured by the ratio of non-financial corporate debt to the book value of tangible assets, fell in 2003 in those sectors prominent in the late 1 990s boom – the high-tech and telecommunication services sectors and the utilities (Chart 1.42).  However, capital gearing increased in some of the sectors most sensitive to oil prices in 2003:  gearing rose in the auto and airlines sectors and was broadly flat in the chemicals and ‘other transportation’ sectors. Credit default swap (CDS) premia have risen for some of the major US auto and auto-parts companies since the previous Review, although they remain much lower than in late 2002.  In mid-October, Standard and Poor’s (S&P) downgraded General Motors (GM) and its GMAC financing subsidiary from BBB to BBB- (one notch above sub-investment-grade) but changed the outlook to stable.  And in November, Moody’s also downgraded GM’s and GMAC’s long-term debt ratings by one notch.  As well as a tough operating environment the auto industry also faces large unfunded pension and healthcare obligations. Rising oil prices have affected US passenger airlines.  Most major airlines remain unprofitable, with US Airways Group filing for bankruptcy on 12 September 2004.  CDS premia for most other major airlines have fallen since the June 2004 Review, but remain high.  The direct exposures of US banks are small and mostly secured on aircraft assets, providing some protection in the case of default. In the first three quarters of 2004, the annualised rate of total bankruptcies was about half of that in 2003.  The annualised rates for the transport and chemicals sectors were also lower than in recent years.  High-yield spreads in the chemical sector have fallen since the previous Review, consistent with reports that, despite higher energy costs, sales have grown. Credit quality improved further in 2004 Q2 and Q3, with the proportion of non-current C&I loans falling to its lowest level since the beginning of 2000 (Chart 1.43).  The Shared National Credit (SNC) Review1 indicated that the stock of large syndicated loan commitments fell by 6% in the year to 2004 Q2.

Loan quality improved across all industrial sectors, particularly in the telecoms and cable sector and the manufacturing sector.  Nevertheless, over 10% of outstanding commitments to the telecoms and cable sector and the oil, gas, pipeline and utilities sector remain ‘classified’ . Commercial property Lending to commercial real estate (CRE) has continued to grow rapidly.  It now accounts for almost one eighth of commercial banks’ outstanding loans and over a quarter of total loans at small US banks;  some of the latter might be vulnerable in the event of a downturn in the commercial property market.  But delinquency and charge-off rates on commercial real estate have remained surprisingly low given the high level of vacancy rates (Chart 1.43).  Demand for office space declined sharply in 2001 and, although it has picked up this year, office vacancy rates remain at a relatively high level (Chart 1.44).  Vacancy rates for industrial property also rose sharply in 2001 and remain at a historically high level. Banking Overall, the US banking sector remains strong.  Published capital ratios and profitability are high, and credit quality has improved. Since the June 2004 Review, bank share prices have outperformed the S&P 500 and CDS premia for large domestic banks have narrowed. Having fallen in 2004 Q2, the profits of US commercial banks and savings institutions recovered in the third quarter and the return on equity remained relatively high (Chart 1.45).  The Second-quarter profits were depressed by litigation charges at JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup and by lower gains on sales of securities following the rise in long-term interest rates. Trading revenues fell sharply in the third quarter to their lowest level since the autumn of 1 998.  In aggregate, US banks and savings institutions recorded a loss of $1.4 billion on interest rate exposures, largely accounted for by the largest US commercial banks.  Market contacts report that some large US banks were wrongly positioned on long-term interest rates.  Losses on interest rates exposures were partly offset by record trading revenues from ‘commodity and other exposures’1 (Chart 1.46). Net interest income continued to increase rapidly as strong loan growth offset a further narrowing of net interest margins.  The fall in net interest margins was accounted for by large banks which rely more on wholesale funding which tends to be repriced more quickly than retail deposits.

The biggest absolute increase was in exposures to Germany, which have risen above those to Hong Kong, largely reflecting a rise in holdings of public-sector debt.  The rise in exposures was due more to growth of existing businesses than to mergers and acquisitions.  But the purchase of First Active mortgage bank by RBS contributed to a sharp increase in exposures to Ireland;  these rose by a third, though remain smaller than those to Germany or France. Despite the recent increase, the share of UK-owned banks’ international exposures accounted for by Europe has risen only slightly in the past five years, and by less than the share accounted for by the United States (the share of other international exposures has fallen).  This pattern broadly mirrors the relative growth performance of the euro area and the United States.  Euro-area growth eased further in 2004 Q3, and Consensus forecasts for euro-area growth in 2005 have edged down since the June 2004 Review, suggesting lower expectations of incomes growth.  However, longer-term market interest rates have fallen since the previous Review, so the net effect on prospective debt servicing burdens is unclear.  The depreciation of the dollar and uncertainty surrounding oil prices pose some risks to activity and income, although – as in other industrial economies – oil price effects may be limited by a reduction in the oil intensity of production over the years. The private non-financial sector The household sector Euro-area banks’ loans to euro-area households account for some 1 8% of their total assets, a smaller share than the analogue for UK-owned banks.  But these exposures have risen rapidly in the past year (Chart 1.47), largely because of rising lending for house purchase, associated with rapid increases in house prices in a number of countries.  Low real interest rates have also encouraged the increase in lending to households in some countries (Chart 1.48), and consumer credit growth overall has risen in the past year.  As a result, household debt-to-income ratios have picked up in several European countries, increasing households’ vulnerability to adverse shocks to interest rates or incomes3 34 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) Defined here as the euro-area countries plus Denmark, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.

In some of those countries – particularly Spain and Ireland – some UK-owned banks have sizeable direct exposures to households via their operations overseas.  But the picture across Europe is varied, and in Germany, in particular, house prices have been weak and the household debt-to-income ratio stable.  Box 4 provides a further assessment of debt-to-income ratios across the major industrial countries. Nevertheless, income gearing seems likely to have remained moderate in most countries (Chart 1.50), reflecting continued low interest rates, stable, if high, unemployment and rising nominal earnings.  Lending growth has been most rapid where most loans are advanced at variable interest rates, perhaps because of lower initial debt servicing costs (given the slope of the yield curve in recent years).  That is likely to have increased the sensitivity of debt servicing in those countries to changes in interest rates. The likelihood of households defaulting is also affected by personal insolvency law.  Many continental European countries do not have formal personal insolvency regimes, so data are scarce.  But in Germany personal insolvencies have risen markedly (Chart 1.51), albeit from a low base, following legislation making it easier for individual debtors to petition for bankruptcy.1 That increase parallels the further rise in UK insolvencies following legislative change (see Chapter 1.1).  But household lending forms a substantially smaller share of bank lending in Germany than in the United Kingdom, and comparisons are hard to draw given that personal insolvency laws differ in the two countries. The private non-financial corporate sector Lending by euro-area banks to euro-area PNFCs accounts for some 1 5% of total euro-area banks’ assets, a higher share than lending to domestic companies accounts for in the United Kingdom, reflecting the generally greater reliance of continental companies on bank finance.  Lending growth has edged up since the June 2004 Review, though the ECB’s euro-area bank lending survey suggests continued subdued corporate loan demand, largely reflecting weak investment demand, greater use by companies of market-based finance and increasing availability of internal funds.  The same survey also points to a slight net easing of credit standards in 2004 Q2 and Q3, in response to increased competition among both lenders and other investors.  Gross issuance in the corporate loan markets has been robust, in large part reflecting the refinancing of debt on cheaper or easier terms.  But capital gearing has edged down in the past 1 8 months, as equity prices have risen (Chart 1.52).

A high level of aggregate debt in a country or sector may, when combined with other information, help to provide an early warning of increasing aggregate default risk.1 Estimates of the aggregate G122 sectoral debt-to-income measures were compiled using recently published OECD data3 based on the System of National Accounts 1 993, which was designed to provide consistent but not exhaustive guidance on the compilation of national accounts.  Table 1 highlights the range of movements across countries for ‘debt-like’ liabilities. Countries do not provide data on a completely uniform basis.  For example, countries differ as to whether they provide consolidated (at the sector or sub-sector level) or unconsolidated data. Differences in method are more pronounced for total liabilities than for ‘debt-like’ liabilities,4 as the former include shares and other equity and the insurance technical reserves classes, for which there is greater scope for variations in measurement and institutional treatment. The liabilities measured are predominantly on-balance-sheet, thus excluding some potentially large liabilities, such as unfunded pension schemes and financial derivatives.  The data are only available annually from end-1 995 to end-2002 so far.  While of limited use for current surveillance, they do provide an insight into the broad trends. ‘Debt-like’ liabilities are more likely to be relevant for financial stability than are total liabilities.  Chart A shows the ratio of ‘debt-like’ liabilities to GDP at market value for each of four sectors aggregated across the G12 countries.  The financial corporations sector has the most liabilities, as, in carrying out financial intermediation, it acts as counterparty to each of the other sectors. Box 4:  International debt-to-income ratios (1) Aggregate debt-to-income ratios do not, though, provide an insight into the distribution of debt across agents in the economy, and a given aggregate ratio can be consistent with quite different levels of aggregate default risk if that distribution differs.  Some Bank work has adopted a micro-level approach, using agents’ financial accounts to analyse the indebtedness of both households and companies.  For example, the number and type of households accumulating debt have been investigated (see Tudela, M and Young, G (2003), ‘The distribution of unsecured debt in the United Kingdom:  survey evidence’ , Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Winter) while company accounts have been compared across countries (See ‘Box 3:  Comparing the leverage of US, UK, French and German firms’ , in the December 2003 Review).

The number of corporate ratings downgrades has fallen back, broadly to match the number of upgrades (Chart 1.53), and corporate credit spreads have in general fallen further.  Equity prices have risen since June and equity price volatility has fallen, implying, other things equal, a fall in default risk.  And the equity prices of some sectors that had weakened since the start of the year – in particular airlines and technology – have recently recovered somewhat.  Corporate income gearing is likely to have remained broadly stable in the euro area, as interest rates have remained low.  Corporate earnings are estimated to have increased in 2004, probably reflecting the beneficial effects of The financial stability conjuncture and outlook – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 37 Chart B plots the G12 ‘debt-like’ liabilities non-financial sectoral averages, together with those for the United Kingdom, and shows the recent rise in households’ liabilities in the United Kingdom and the G12 as a whole.  Chart B suggests that there has been a more rapid growth in the level of indebtedness of the UK household and non-financial sectors as a share of GDP than in the G12 as a whole.  UK non-financial corporations’ debt increased significantly faster than GDP after 1 998, whereas the rapid growth in household debt started in 2001.  The UK general government ‘debt-like’ liabilities appear to mirror movements in the corresponding G12 aggregate measure, though at a lower level. Chart C shows short-term ‘debt-like’ liabilities;  data are only available for a smaller sample of countries.  While Chart A shows that aggregate ‘debt-like’ liabilities grew as a share of GDP in 2002, this is only apparent in the financial corporations sector in Chart C, possibly suggesting a switch from short-term towards long-term liabilities in other sectors. The increase in ‘debt-like’ liabilities as a share of GDP over the sample period, together with the rise in financial corporations’ total and ‘debt-like’ liabilities, also suggests that financial activity has been playing an increasingly important role in the economy. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 1996 97 98 99 2000 01 02 Non-financial corporations General government Households and NPISH Per cent Chart B UK and G12 ‘debt-like’ liabilities as a share of annual GDP(a)(b)(c) Sources: OECD, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Bank calculations.

Consistent with market indicators, the incidence of large-scale corporate failures has been low in the past year; sub-investment-grade corporate bond default rates have fallen further (Chart 1.54).  And the number of corporate insolvencies generally seems to have stabilised or fallen during 2004. German corporate insolvency numbers have risen further, however, perhaps reflecting the effect of weak domestic demand on smaller companies, which are typically more dependent on domestic markets than are larger companies. The financial sector Non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) On-balance-sheet claims on NBFIs account for only 3% of euro-area banks’ total assets, although this may understate the potential for contagion from NBFIs to banks, and particularly bancassurers, given that they often operate in the same markets. Ratings agencies report an improved performance among European insurers during 2004 and a continued stabilisation in the ratings outlook, suggesting that the risks facing these institutions have moderated. Banking sectors1 Over half of UK banks’ consolidated international exposures to borrowers in the rest of Europe are to banks, a much higher share than for exposures to the United States.  The profitability of large European banks has continued to recover (Chart 1.55), because of further reductions in costs relative to incomes and a fall in provisions (due primarily to a fall in large-scale corporate failures).  However, the recovery for German banks has remained patchy, with two of the largest four banks reporting negligible profits or a loss in Q3.  Interest income as a share of total assets has tended to edge down further.  The ECB’s euro-area bank lending survey suggests that interest margins on new household lending have been falling, partly because of strong competition and partly perceived improvements in the creditworthiness of households.  In Germany, some large banks have sold non-performing loans to third parties, which may boost those banks’ net interest income in future. As discussed in previous Reviews, indicators of profitability suggest that German banks have significantly lower buffers than the European average (Chart 1.56).  That may partially reflect structural factors, such as the extent of state involvement in the banking sector.

BNP Paribas reports assets on a half-yearly basis;  assets are assumed to remain unchanged from previous half-yearly levels in the intervening quarters.  five years has been around a third that of UK-owned banks.  The removal of explicit state guarantees for German public banks scheduled for July 2005 is likely to add to pressures for consolidation within the German banking sector.  In particular, ‘shadow ratings’ suggest that ratings for Landesbanks will be on average four notches below those under guarantee.1 Some banks have already responded by consolidating and pursuing greater specialisation, and in aggregate Landesbanks have reduced their overseas operations, including those in the United Kingdom. Contacts suggest that Landesbanks have been building up liquidity while state guarantees are still available, providing a cushion for adjustment, but they are likely to need to diversify their sources of financing over the longer term. Market indicators suggest some improvement in the performance of European banks and a reduction in the risk of default;  CDS premia have narrowed further overall since the June 2004 Review (Chart 1.57).  Solvency ratios have remained satisfactory overall, and picked up in the first half of 2004 for those large banks with the weakest solvency ratios.  That, together with increased profitability, indicates an improvement in the financial health of European banks overall. However, some have pointed to continued risks to banks in a number of European countries from high concentrations of balance-sheet exposures to individual companies.2 The failure of Parmalat revealed that, in that case at least, risks had been widely dispersed, although subsequent proceedings have shown that European banks are not immune to litigation risk. Household lending has accounted for a smaller share of euro-area banks’ write-offs and write-downs in recent years than has corporate lending, and in general euro-area banks charge a higher rate of interest on household lending.  Nonetheless, the rapid pace of household lending growth may have been associated with increased credit risks in some countries;  for example, the Banco de España has recently warned lenders in Spain against lending at high loan-to-value ratios.3 In aggregate, European banks continue to have a customer funding gap (Chart 1.58), as do their UK counterparts (Chapter 3).  That gap has been filled by market-based sources of finance, which are generally more expensive than customer deposits and may be more prone to changes in market sentiment.

For example, the yen is involved in 20% of global foreign exchange (FX) transactions and 29% of over-the-counter FX derivatives turnover.  These counterparties – especially Japan’s major banks – are in turn exposed to risks from domestic borrowers, which are mainly corporations and the government. Japan’s non-financial sector The household sector Despite the recovery of output and consumption, growth in employees’ real compensation has been modest.  However, consumer confidence is close to its highest levels in a decade, supported by improved employment prospects.  Consistent with this, the number of personal bankruptcies has fallen further since the previous Review.  The household sector’s financial surplus has fallen, but in stock terms households remain large net creditors, and much household borrowing is at long-term fixed rates. The private non-financial corporate sector As higher demand has not been accompanied by rising labour costs, profits have continued to improve;  in the six months to September, listed firms recorded a 2 1% year-on-year rise in net profits, and raised their profit forecasts for the year to March 2005 by 17%.  Higher profits have allowed PNFCs in aggregate to fund investment while continuing to repay loans and increase financial surpluses (Chart 1.60).  Thus, income gearing and the ratio of debt to operating cashflow (Chart 1.6 1) have fallen.  Small firms remain more heavily indebted than large ones, but the gap has narrowed somewhat. This improved financial position has been reflected in a steep fall in both the number and liabilities of failed businesses in the six months to September (Chart 1.62).  A flurry of recent rating agency upgrades2 suggests a continued upward trend in perceived credit quality, at least of larger companies. Japan’s banking system Non-performing loans (NPLs) have continued to fall at the major banks (Chart 1.63).  With the Japanese Financial Services Agency (JFSA) target of halving NPL ratios from their peaks by 40 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – The financial stability conjuncture and outlook 10 8 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 10 1991 93 95 97 99 2001 03 Percentage of GDP - + Financial surplus Equity issuance Other securities Loans Chart 1.60 Sources of corporate finance(a) Sources:  Bank of Japan and Bank calculations.

(a) June 2004 Review.  March 2005 looming, several banks reported higher-than-expected write-offs and provisioning for loans to troubled borrowers in the six months to September.  Other borrowers were upgraded, benefiting from restructuring or the recovery in corporate profits. The downward trend in banks’ outstanding corporate loans has continued since the June 2004 Review.  Banks have responded by increasing their holdings of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) – now 1 5% of total bank assets.1 The duration of these holdings appears to be short, somewhat mitigating the increase in exposure to the JGB market.  The major banks have further reduced equity holdings since the previous Review. Operating profitability at the major banks remains weak, although they have made some progress in raising fee income over the past year.  Interest margins remain low on corporate lending, and are lower still on the banks’ short-duration bond holdings.  Lending to individuals, which has higher margins, is growing but still accounts for only 1 5% of bank assets. Nevertheless, lower loan-loss charges and smaller valuation losses on securities than in recent years have allowed major banks to raise Tier 1 capital levels and increase capital quality by crystallising deferred tax assets2 (Chart 1.64). Deposit insurance on demand deposits will be capped from April 2005.  Improved bank balance sheets, the official crisis management system for banks and exemptions for settlement accounts should contain the risk of large-scale withdrawals. In July, UFJ and MTFG announced plans for a merger, which now looks likely to be completed by October 2005.  Merging two very large3 and very different banks successfully will be challenging. UFJ’s capital base, depleted by provisioning for NPLs that it had tried to conceal from JFSA inspectors, was strengthened by a capital injection from MTFG in September. Reflecting the sustained improvement in the quality of the major Japanese banks’ assets and capital over the past two years, CDS premia have continued to decline since the June 2004 Review and Moody’s recently raised the bank financial strength ratings4 of SMFG and UFJ from E, the lowest possible level, to E+, and Mizuho’s rating from E to D-.  However, the banks remain poorly capitalised by comparison with their international peers, and low operating profits mean that any negative shocks would erode these capital buffers.

In contrast, lending to Latin America fell (Chart 1.65).2 Borrowing from abroad by EMEs is also intermediated through financial markets.  There has been further large bond issuance by EMEs and bond spreads have fallen in recent months (Chapter 2.1).  And, according to the Institute of International Finance (IIF), total net private sector (bank and bond) debt flows to EMEs this year are expected to be around US$90 billion – the second successive year of strong borrowing (Table 1.A). The external environment facing EMEs has remained benign, in large part, since the previous Review.  World output growth is likely to reach a thirty-year high this year and world interest rates, and thus EME external funding costs, remain low despite the tightening of US monetary policy since the summer.  And a number of EMEs have also benefited from the continued strength of (non-agricultural) commodity prices. Consequently, private sector and IMF forecasts of output growth for this year in all the main EME regions have been revised upwards, to over 5% according to Consensus Economics (Chart 1.66).  There have also been a number of sovereign credit rating upgrades in recent months, including of some large international borrowers such as Brazil and Turkey. Only a modest slowdown is generally expected in world growth next year and so the external outlook facing EMEs remains favourable.  There are, though, a number of downside risks.  On the one hand, a combination of sustained higher oil prices, a sharp rise in world interest rates and significantly lower world growth (and non-oil commodity prices) would hurt many EMEs. If, on the other hand, the external environment remains benign, there is a risk that some EME governments or private sectors may borrow more than their future capacity to repay over the longer term. This section explores these issues in more detail. 42 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) EMEs are defined here as countries in central and eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and Asia (other than Japan). (2) Non-Japan Asia accounts for the lion’s share of UK banks’ exposures to EMEs.

Sustained high oil prices The price of Brent crude oil has risen to around $40 per barrel from $35 at the time of the June 2004 Review and less than $30, on average, last year.  If prices remain high, this could have a large impact on EMEs, by switching income from oil-importing countries towards a smaller number of oil-producing economies. This would be more likely to be harmful in aggregate if driven by a reduction in world oil supply rather than continued buoyant world demand. The main gainers would be concentrated in OPEC countries and a few non-OPEC producers, in particular Russia.  In the short run, the rise in oil prices has significantly improved the external and government financial balance sheets of these countries. However, in the longer term, it may, in some cases, delay structural reform and output diversification and build up underlying vulnerabilities that would become apparent if oil price increases were reversed. Net oil importers are more numerous;  economies in Asia and, to a lesser extent, in emerging Europe (other than Russia) would be affected most.  So far at least, the impact has been cushioned, to some extent, because the rise in oil prices partly reflects the fast growth of the Chinese and US economies.  This has boosted non-oil exports, particularly from the rest of Asia, and, through raising prices, the export earnings of EME metal producers. The latter has benefited economies in Latin America and the former Soviet Union in particular (Chart 1.67).1 In addition, most Asian economies have built up strong external positions in recent years by running current account surpluses and building up foreign currency reserves.  Some emerging European economies would appear to be more vulnerable, since they are starting from a position of current account deficit (Chart 1.68). The increase in oil prices is also likely to have a bigger domestic impact on EMEs than on developed countries, since the former tend to be much less efficient in using oil.  To the extent that oil price rises are being passed on to consumers, inflationary pressures are building up.  Across most EMEs, price inflation has been edging up during this year and some countries, such as Brazil, Poland and Thailand, have responded by increasing interest rates. A number of EMEs, though, subsidise oil, shifting the cost of higher oil prices on to the government’s budget instead.  This has increased the burden on some already highly indebted governments such as India and Indonesia. The financial stability conjuncture and outlook – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 43 (1) According to IMF estimates, the increase in non-energy commodity prices this year has boosted the net exports of EME oil importers by almost 0.5% of GDP , on average (IMF World Economic Outlook, September 2004, Table 1.17 , page 67). 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Brazil Venezuela Latvia Belarus Estonia Czech Rep.

(a) Oil balance comprises the sum of crude and refined products, 2003 data. (b) Calculated by multiplying the 2003 oil balance by the percentage increase in oil prices (2003:  $29 per barrel).  The change in the oil balance is shown as a percentage of forecast 2004 GDP (2003 current account balance percentage of GDP shown below bars).  The interest rate environment Sustained higher oil prices and/or a marked slowdown in the world economy would weaken EMEs more if combined with an unexpectedly sharp rise in US interest rates associated with, for example, a rise in inflation expectations or marked downward pressure on the US dollar.  That would increase EMEs’ external funding costs and, in extremis, could prevent some borrowers obtaining external finance altogether. Earlier Bank work suggests that, everything else equal, a 100 basis point rise in US policy rates would result in about an 80 basis point rise in the average EME spread from the current level.1 However, in practice, the sensitivity of EME spreads to changes in US interest rates would also be affected by the cause of the increase and on general market sentiment at the time.2 For example, the 100 basis point rise in official US interest rates since June has been associated with a fall rather than a rise in spreads in most EMEs (Chart 1.69). But as discussed in previous Reviews, many EMEs have reduced their immediate vulnerability to a reversal in market sentiment. A number of EME sovereigns have taken the opportunity of low external funding costs not only to finance their needs for this year but to begin prefinancing for next year.  Some have also continued to lengthen the maturity of their debt structures and reduce the proportion of debt linked to foreign currency.3 Nonetheless, some large EMEs, especially in emerging Europe (other than Russia), have large and growing external financing requirements (Chart 1.70). Conversely, if world interest rates remain low, there is a risk that some EME governments or private sectors will borrow more than their future capacity to repay.  Some EMEs with very large government debt-GDP ratios, such as Brazil and Turkey, are currently running large primary surpluses and thus have somewhat reduced their debt burdens since the end of last year. But, despite current robust GDP growth, some EME governments have maintained high debt burdens or increased them further, by running only small primary surpluses or deficits (Chart 1.71). These fiscal positions would look less favourable still if current strong GDP growth were not maintained. 44 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) See Ferrucci, G (2003), ‘Empirical determinants of emerging market economies’ sovereign spreads’ , Bank of England Working Paper 205, October.

(a) Bars to the left of the axis denote rises in spreads, falls in equity prices and depreciation of the exchange rate.  Data on EMEs’ private sector debt are less readily available.  But EME foreign currency corporate bond issuance this year has been strong (Chart 1.72).  This has been most pronounced in Asia and Russia.  To the extent that this represents borrowing brought forward from next year to take advantage of cheap financing costs, this has reduced EMEs’ funding costs.  But it could also reflect lenders moving down the credit quality spectrum in search of higher returns.  Moreover, unlike sovereigns, many corporate borrowers are unrated with limited public information on their creditworthiness.  In Russia, whereas the government’s outstanding external debt is falling, the private sector’s is rising quickly, albeit from a low starting point.  And to the extent that recent corporate issuance in Russia is rated, most of it is sub-investment-grade (Box 5). However, from a UK perspective, although UK-owned banks’ exposures to EMEs have increased strongly in the past two years, the average quality of these exposures, proxied by the sovereign rating of the borrower, has increased (Chart 1.73). As discussed in the June 2004 Review, bank lending to households is growing strongly in emerging Europe (Chart 1.7 4). And in some countries sizeable loans are being made in foreign currency.  This seems to have been partly financed over the past year by strong interbank borrowing from BIS-area banks in foreign currency (Chart 1.7 5).  There is a risk that household borrowers in some EMEs do not fully realise the foreign exchange risk they are taking on.  This could materialise as a credit loss to the lending banks. Slowdown in China In China, the rapid growth in output over the past decade and continuing economic liberalisation mean that its economic conjuncture and policies are now having a significant impact upon the wider world economy and financial system. There was a steady slowdown in the Chinese economy in the first half of the year, confined to the domestic corporate sector.  But more recent data give conflicting evidence of whether the slowdown has continued since. The annual growth in bank lending has been on a steady downward path during this year, from 20% in March to 1 3% in October – well below the authorities’ 1 6%–17% target range. There are also reports of a severe shortage of credit in some sectors.  But the annual rate of growth in investment and industrial production stopped falling in June (having declined rapidly earlier in the year).  Companies are probably financing spending, to some extent, from outside the official banking system.  The growth rates in retail sales and exports remain buoyant (Chart 1.76).  Moreover, although annual consumer price inflation has fallen since the June 2004 Review, to 4.3% in The financial stability conjuncture and outlook – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 45 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 1997 98 99 2000 01 02 03 04 Private non-bank companies Private banks Public sector companies Unclassified Sovereign/government US$ billions(a) Chart 1.72 EME external bond issuance January 1997- October 2004  Source:  Dealogic.

In the aftermath of the crisis, net debt flows to emerging market economies (EMEs) dried up, but have again grown strongly over the past two years (Chart A).  Moreover, gross issuance of foreign currency debt – bonds and syndicated loans – during this year has returned to levels last seen in 1 997 (Chart B). External equity issuance has also been strong, although less so than debt. This renewed borrowing by EMEs in the past two years partly reflects an improvement in fundamentals.  Many EMEs have accumulated sizeable foreign exchange reserves, improved debt structures, adopted more flexible exchange rate regimes1 and – in Asia and Latin America at least – are running current account surpluses.  Therefore, the level of debt that EME borrowers can sustain has probably increased.  The demand for EME debt has also been buoyed by low global interest rates.  Moreover, longer-term structural inflows by pension funds from developed economies seeking to diversify their portfolios have increased the amount of funds available to EMEs. Nonetheless, there is a risk that some emerging market governments or companies may borrow more than is sustainable in the medium term should the current benign conditions not continue.  This would especially be the case if the strong output growth witnessed currently in many EMEs and high (non-agricultural) commodity prices are not maintained. For governments, high indebtedness could lead to a future sovereign debt crisis.  For companies, excessive leverage, especially if combined with a currency mismatch between assets and liabilities, could lead to widespread defaults on bonds and loans.  The Asian crisis, in the second half of the 1 990s, showed how a fast build-up of corporate debt can contribute to vulnerabilities in the financial system as a whole. On the sovereign side, recent fiscal performance has improved in some highly indebted EMEs.  For example, Brazil and Turkey are targeted to run primary fiscal surpluses of 4.5% of GDP and 6.5% of GNP respectively this year, while some other countries, such as Romania and Chile, have decided to cancel planned external debt issuance altogether.  And a number of EMEs have accumulated sizeable foreign currency assets.  However, the ratio of government debt to GDP , on average, in EMEs is estimated to Box 5:  Are there risks of emerging market debtors over-borrowing? (1) According to the IMF (IMF World Economic Outlook (September 2004)), the proportion of emerging markets with fully floating exchange rates has risen from under 20% in 1 998 to 40% today.  0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Jan.

(a) Estimate for 2003, forecast for 2004.  The financial stability conjuncture and outlook – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 47 have risen by 6.5% of GDP since 2001.1 Moreover, despite strong output growth, a number of EMEs (for example, the large new member states of the EU) continue to run primary fiscal deficits. Although gross foreign currency debt issuance by both EME sovereigns and companies has been close to record levels this year, corporate sector issuance has increased particularly rapidly. Unlike sovereign debt, the majority of corporate issuance has been unrated, especially in Asia (Chart C), so lenders are increasing their exposures particularly to borrowers in EMEs about whom there is likely to be limited information on creditworthiness.  One of the lessons of the Asian crisis is that lending to relatively untransparent borrowers carries the risk of not being able to identify potential vulnerabilities.2 Corporate bond and syndicated loan issuance has risen particularly rapidly in Russia this year – by 52% in the year to mid-November over the same period last year.  Most of this issuance has been sub-investment-grade (Chart C) but half has been made by oil and gas (related) companies which should be able to generate strong foreign currency earnings (if energy prices remain high).  However, metal producers, banks and telecommunications companies have also been undertaking large amounts of issuance.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that investors, particularly from Europe, are buying Russian debt to benefit from the generally improved macroeconomic outlook there.  Given that the government has reduced its external debt (and built up a large cushion of foreign exchange reserves), investors instead have switched their exposures to companies.  Although external private sector debt in Russia is low by EME standards, it has increased rapidly of late – from 1% to 9% of GDP in the two years to end 2003 (Chart D).  Banks from the BIS area as a whole increased their international claims on Russia by 36% (US$46 billion) in the year to 2004 Q2.  UK-owned banks alone increased exposures by 80%, mainly to the non-bank private sector, but this level of exposure remains small, at around 1% of UK-owned bank exposures to all EMEs (Chart E). Overall, as yet, there is no widespread evidence of EMEs increasing indebtedness sharply.  But there is evidence in some countries of strong borrowing by unrated or low-rated firms. Given the lack of transparency of many companies, and the role that corporate defaults have played in previous financial crises, this trend deserves continuing monitoring.

October, annual goods inflation is strong and still rising (9.6% in September) and real interest rates remain negative on some measures.  In response to these renewed risks of overheating, the authorities increased interest rates by 0.27% points at the end of October – the first rise in interest rates in nine years. A ‘hard landing’ would increase further the fragility of the Chinese banking system, where non-performing loans, estimated at US$200 billion (1 4% of GDP), represent a large contingent claim on the government.  But there is recent evidence of improvement, at least amongst some of the bigger banks.  The non-performing loan ratio of the major banks1 fell, on official figures, by 3.3% points during 2004 Q2, while the NPL ratio at the Bank of China – one of the largest state-owned banks – fell to 4.6% in October and its capital adequacy ratio is now above the Basel minimum.  And the recent liberalisation of capital controls is likely to result in an inflow of foreign investment, thus strengthening some Chinese banks further.2 A marked slowdown of the Chinese economy would not only increase domestic vulnerabilities but also would reduce export and GDP growth in the rest of Asia, especially in the Newly Industrialised Economies and Japan.3 World commodity prices too might fall, hurting commodity-producing EMEs further afield;  between 2001 and 2003, China’s imports of raw materials and fuels increased by 55% and 67% respectively. The most tangible impact of any slowdown in China on the UK financial system would probably be via Hong Kong, where UK-owned banks have large exposures.  However, currently at least, the Hong Kong economy continues to witness a strong and broad-based recovery.  Although output growth moderated in the third quarter, it remained robust – real GDP rose by 7 .2% year-on-year (and by 1.9% during quarter).  Despite the hard currency peg, substantial liquidity in the money market has meant that bank lending rates in Hong Kong have risen by less than the increase in US rates.  Consumer prices have stopped falling.  The banking sector has also strengthened further.  Asset quality has improved, with credit card delinquency rates falling to 0.55% in the third quarter – the lowest since the survey started in 1 996 – and the mortgage delinquency rate falling to 0.4% in October (Chart 1.77).4 48 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – The financial stability conjuncture and outlook 0 20 40 60 80 100 Jan.

The financial stability conjuncture and outlook – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 49 2 Risks in the international financial system: key points Financial market developments since the June Review have been consistent with favourable macroeconomic conditions.  Global economic growth has remained robust and inflation expectations contained.  Large complex financial institutions (LCFIs) have benefited from high rates of return on their equity and hold substantial cushions of capital.  The downside risk that market yield curves might rise sharply in response to the recent increases in US official interest rates, prompting wider asset price volatility, did not materialise;  and measures of realised and expected asset price volatility are generally lower. But despite the benign operating environment, there remains the possibility that financial market participants may be underestimating key vulnerabilities and mis-pricing market risks.  In particular: ● Financial intermediaries and investors appear to have continued their ‘search for yield’ in a wide range of markets, holding positions that could leave them vulnerable to instability in the pattern of global capital flows and exchange rates, credit events or sharper-than-expected interest rate rises.  A number of market participants have also discussed the possibility that risk is being underpriced.  In the event of an adverse shock, any over-accumulation of exposures from the mis-pricing of assets may result in an abrupt, and costly, adjustment of balance sheets; ● Hedge funds continue to experience strong inflows from investors.  Given the relatively modest returns on many hedge fund strategies, some are increasing their involvement in less liquid markets.  LCFIs face a number of challenges.  These include low margins and subdued demand for traditional investment banking services, which has prompted expansion into other activities, including commodity markets and provision of prime brokerage services to hedge funds.  LCFIs may also need to tackle the consequences of regulatory investigation and litigation, as well as manage their participation in the rapidly growing structured credit markets; ● Large UK-owned banks have also been active in international financial markets, and their gross inter-bank exposure to foreign-owned financial institutions, including LCFIs, is sizeable.  This leaves them exposed to potentially significant counterparty credit risks.  And they face market risk, through both their trading books and banking books.  2 Risks in the international financial system 2.1 International financial markets The market environment At the time of the June 2004 Review, economic data suggestive of a stronger global cyclical upswing, particularly in the United States, had prompted upward revisions to financial markets’ expectations of the path of official interest rates. Perhaps the major near-term challenge preoccupying financial intermediaries and traders was their exit strategies from a variety of positions characterising the ‘search for yield’ described in previous Reviews.1 In the event, while increasing official interest rates by 25 basis points four times during this period, the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has repeated “that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured” .2 The effect of this on financial markets, together with generally less strong economic data in the summer and early autumn, particularly in the United States, and rising oil prices, seems to have been to support the view that US official interest rates will not rise as far, or as soon, as anticipated in the spring (Chart 2.1). Partly against that background, government bond yields have fallen back at longer maturities (Chart 2.2);  credit spreads have continued to narrow;  and equity markets are for the most part higher.  Actual volatility, and expected volatility implied by options, has declined in many markets (Chart 2.3).  More generally, financial intermediaries and investors have maintained many of the strategies characterising the ‘search for yield’ . The current pattern of financial asset prices is, for some market participants, consistent with a benign economic outlook – a view which emphasises actual and expected global growth, well-anchored inflation expectations, and generally stronger corporate and emerging-market sovereign balance sheets. The sustainability and the possible longer-run implications of the ‘search for yield’ continue, however, to be widely discussed. Concerns centre on two possible adjustment mechanisms, which could have an impact on the stability of the financial system.  In the shorter term, there could be an asset price correction at some point in particular markets, perhaps with spillovers to other parts of the system.  A second risk is of credit problems over a 50 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) See the June 2004 Review, pages 47–48, and the December 2003 Review, pages 17–1 8.

In this context, many commentators and market participants have contrasted the apparently benign outlook implied by financial asset prices with the range of uncertainties and sources of downside risk that they continue to perceive.  Those enumerated by practitioners include:  concerns about the sustainability of the current pattern of global capital flows;  the possibility of more aggressive tightening of official interest rates than is currently implied by yield curves;  risks to global growth from higher oil and other industrial commodity prices;  and, perhaps, an event that precipitates a more general repricing of credit risk.  On this view, low implied volatility in some markets is a puzzle, and may reflect implied volatility largely tracking realised volatility – which has declined in many markets – rather than being forward-looking. Some possible downside risks Foreign exchange markets For much of the period, the major exchange rates were relatively stable, and implied, as well as actual, volatility fell.  This encouraged a re-emergence of carry trades, with short positions against the US dollar funding long positions in, for example, the Canadian dollar, the euro and, early in the period, sterling. Later in the period, the US dollar depreciated (by 5.9% on an effective basis over the period as a whole):  the euro and some Asian currencies appreciated.  Currency implied volatilities, which had fallen earlier in the period, rose (Chart 2.4).  In part, this appeared to reflect renewed market concerns about the stability of the current pattern of international capital flows, given the large external financing needs of the United States. Foreign portfolio flows – including official flows – have tended in recent years to be more concentrated in US debt markets:  as well as US Treasuries, these have included the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) and US corporate bonds (Chart 2.5).  A potential risk, therefore, is that any reduction in the share of foreigners’ saving going into these assets could affect their required return, with actual returns adjusting via some combination of a fall in dollar exchange rates and falls in the dollar price of these assets. The June 2004 Review noted that the exchange rate policies and investment strategies of a number of Asian authorities would be relevant to developments in currency and interest rate markets. Recent price movements in the renminbi non-deliverable forward market suggest that market participants have increased their expectation of a change in China’s exchange rate policies (Chart 2.6).  Some commentators have described the current arrangements as akin to a de facto second ‘Bretton Woods’ system.1 Market contacts have suggested that the stability The financial stability conjuncture and outlook – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 51 8.5 9.0 9.5 10.0 10.5 11.0 11.5 1 3 6 12 Per cent Maturity of the option contract (months) June 2004 Review  Dec. 2004 Review  End of Aug. 2004 0.0 Chart 2.4 Term structure of implied volatility for the US dollar/yen bilateral exchange rate(a) Sources:  RBS Markets and Bank calculations.

To the extent that the official policies on which this anticipation of stability is based proved to be less durable than markets generally appear to expect, there is a risk of potentially abrupt movements in currency and interest rate markets.  For some currency pairs, for example dollar/yen, any large adjustment might be complicated by hedging in options markets, notably in relation to so-called power reverse dual currency notes, as discussed in previous Reviews.2 Interest rate markets Near-term uncertainty in the market about the course of monetary policy has apparently fallen since the spring (Chart 2.7).  However, a risk that policy rates in the major economies could rise further and sooner than markets currently anticipate has been identified by a number of market participants.  Indeed, the published results of a number of large US banks reveal that they had been positioned accordingly in the first half of the review period, particularly on the US yield curve, sustaining losses on those positions (Chart 2.8) (see also Chapter 1.3).  Proprietary survey data were also consistent with many asset managers having expressed the same view (in the sense of being short relative to their interest rate duration benchmarks).  The closing of outright short, or short-of-duration-benchmark, positions in US fixed-income markets has been suggested as one factor amplifying the decline in US yields.  At the same time, market contacts have suggested that others – particularly perhaps in the official sector – may have been lengthening the duration of their portfolios. It is hard to know the extent to which financial intermediaries have hedged their exposures to interest rate risk.  Some have suggested that hedging was one element in large interest rate options trades seen on US and UK exchanges in the autumn. However, were the risk of sharply higher yields to materialise – as anticipated by some in the spring – it is possible that financial intermediaries would face quite a challenge in managing the various strategies that constitute the ‘search for yield’ , with potential knock-on effects to, for example, swap and credit spreads. Equity markets Equity markets in the major industrial economies have for the most part risen since the previous Review (Chart 2.9).

One category of downside risk that some market participants have identified is a shock to global oil supply, resulting in oil prices rising significantly higher than recent levels, and so potentially sufficient both materially to reduce global growth and to raise inflation expectations.  While this would represent a material downside risk to global equity markets, options-derived skews on major equity indices have become slightly less negative over the review period (Chart 2.10). High corporate profitability in some of the major economies has resulted in companies returning cash to shareholders in the form of higher dividends and share buy-backs.  As well as releveraging balance sheets, this may, at least in the short run, have added further liquidity to the ‘search for yield’ by investors as the cash is redeployed. Risks from the corporate sector Another downside risk is a credit event that resulted in a, perhaps abrupt, repricing of risk.  Potential sources of such risk might include a crystallisation of difficulties in a particular sector – possible examples are automobile manufacturing or the aviation industry – that resulted in a significant credit ratings downgrade, or even administration, for a particular firm. Alternatively, regulatory or judicial investigations and actions might have a sufficient impact in particular industries to result in significant movements in the prices of their debt and equity. The insurance sector has been a recent focus for the markets in this respect, with the price of default protection rising markedly for a brief period (Chart 2.1 1). The global insurance industry has also been confronted with an unusually high frequency of natural catastrophes since the previous Review, notably the US hurricane season.  Losses will be mostly borne by US primary insurers.  Global reinsurers were little affected, partly because the losses were spread over a number of discrete events, rather than one large event. Less liquid markets The risks outlined above have been the subject of stress tests by a number of financial intermediaries.  Should any of them crystallise, a degree of comfort can be taken from the depth and liquidity of the major traded markets, and indeed from the generally strong balance sheets of the large complex financial institutions in particular.  Market participants have, however, suggested that some other markets, which have experienced recent rapid growth associated with the ‘search for yield’ , but which remain less liquid, could be vulnerable to less orderly adjustment. An example of this was apparent in late summer when there were reports of large-scale sales of Japanese and other Asian The financial stability conjuncture and outlook – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 53 10 5 0 5 10 15 20 25 EMEs(b) Japan Euro area United Kingdom United States World In local currency In US dollars Per cent + - Chart 2.9 Regional equity index performance(a) Sources: Morgan Stanley Capital International, Bloomberg and Bank calculations.

This appears to have been prompted by falls in the mark-to-market value of convertible bonds as implied equity volatility declined, perhaps exacerbated by retail investors effectively selling volatility by purchasing structured notes with embedded optionality.1 Commodity markets The sharp rise in commodity prices has drawn new capital into these markets.  Data on speculative positioning bear this out to an extent (Chart 2.12).  Many have associated the sharp single-day fall in some industrial metals prices in the autumn with speculative activity (Chart 2.1 3).  At the same time, investors are turning their attention to commodity markets, as part of a wider trend towards increasing their portfolio allocations to so-called ‘alternative asset classes’ .2 In many cases, their exposures to the commodities sector appear to take the form of investments in products linked to commodity indices;  or of investments in, for example, those hedge funds that trade commodity markets. Emerging market economies (EMEs) Just as the widening of credit spreads in the spring was particularly pronounced for emerging market sovereign and corporate debt, so too has been the subsequent spread narrowing.  EME equity prices have also risen strongly, especially in emerging Europe and Latin America. Low funding costs have resulted in strong foreign currency issuance of bonds and syndicated loans this year, especially by EME companies (see Chapter 1).  Some contacts have drawn attention to record high sales of heavily over-subscribed issues of Russian corporate bonds, despite concerns about property rights highlighted by the Yukos case and difficulties in the banking sector.  More generally, the narrowing of sovereign spreads since their peak in autumn 2002 suggests a significantly larger perceived reduction in credit risk than do ratings agencies’ credit upgrades, especially among lower credit quality sovereigns (Chart 2.1 4).  However, models of spreads based on fundamentals suggest that EME spreads remain higher than predicted. Market contacts report that the ‘search for yield’ in EMEs, in particular via carry trades, has re-emerged.  However, there have also been suggestions that recent flows into EMEs, which have 54 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) See ‘Box 5:  Convertible bond arbitrage’ in the June 2001 Review, page 73;  and Rule, D, Garratt, A and Rummel, O (2004), ‘Structured note markets:  products, participants and links to wholesale derivatives markets’ , Bank of England Financial Stability Review, June.

Hedge funds and institutional investors are reported to be showing interest in EMEs on a longer-term basis than in the mid-to late-1 990s.  It is difficult to evaluate such judgments, since they are not dissimilar from those made in the mid-1 990s. A protracted period of stability, with more modest returns than during the recent rally, may be necessary to embed these holdings in long-term portfolios. Credit markets Since the relatively brief repricing of risk and tightening of credit conditions in the spring, many of the trends in credit markets described in the June 2004 Review have re-emerged, and in some cases may have intensified (Chart 2.1 6).  A general narrowing of credit spreads is consistent with an improved outlook for corporate credit risk;  only a few troubled sectors, such as airlines and the automobile industry, are exceptions. With generally modest demand for net external finance, spreads have fallen to equilibrate the demand for credit risk exposure with supply.  The questions are whether risk is being priced properly, and to what extent the search for yield is leading to excessive leverage – for example in the leveraged buy-out and structured credit markets.  Issuance by sub-investment-grade companies has remained relatively high, which in the past has been a precursor of an increase in defaults (Chart 2.17). In the syndicated loan market, contacts report lengthening maturities and further weakening in terms and conditions.  This is particularly the case for leveraged loans, for which demand has continued to be strong in the United States and Europe (Chart 2.1 8).  Leverage multiples are reported to be near late-1 990s highs (including examples of over six times equity), and covenants have been relaxed.  However, the market may now be less concentrated by industry sector than in the late-1 990s (when the focus was the technology, media, and telecommunications sector), although refinancing of cable companies has been one pocket of concentration in Europe.  It also seems that risk transfer may be aided by a greater share of loan issuance being taken up by non-banks, including, for the moment, hedge funds;  and by greater syndication of loans bridging to high-yield debt issuance – although it remains to be seen to what extent these developments will persist if credit conditions tighten. Risk transfer also increasingly occurs via the structured credit markets, which have continued to expand very rapidly.  One driver is said to have been European and Asian regional banks seeking to increase their international credit exposures synthetically, apparently on the view that they could build a higher quality and more diversified book more easily that way than in the cash loan markets.

The structured credit markets have, indeed, made it possible for more investors to diversify and leverage credit portfolios – in other words, some previously missing markets now exist. Recently, the renewed compression in corporate bond spreads has spurred greater and more complex use of leverage – for example, so-called CDO-squared (and, more recently, CDO-cubed) – as dealers seek to assemble tranches of portfolios that meet investors’ return, risk and credit rating criteria while also yielding expected profits for the arrangers (Chart 2.1 9).  But the ‘search for yield’ may well have driven spread compression too far.  For example, some of the largest declines in credit spreads this year have been in companies with wide credit spreads given their credit rating.  In addition to the influence of economic fundamentals, declines in the spreads of these companies are said, by many practitioners, also to reflect their inclusion in structured credit portfolios.  This is because their relatively wide spreads allow the arranger to increase yields without affecting the ratings of the tranches. When dealers arrange tranches of credit portfolios for investors, the investor effectively sells credit protection, leaving the intermediary with an unhedged position where they have effectively bought protection.  Dealers typically aim to (delta) hedge by selling sufficient protection – in the single-name credit default swap (CDS) market, or using the DJ iTraxx credit indices – to offset their exposure to movements in credit spreads.  If the tranches are leveraged, the size of the hedge will be a multiple of the tranche size.  Market contacts say that the scale of these hedging flows has put downward pressure on CDS premia, which at times have fallen below the spread over Libor on an issuer’s bonds.  In this way, investor demand for portfolio tranches feeds through into narrower spreads on corporate bonds.  Until the markets become fully liquid and efficient, it is possible that this could occasionally drive a wedge between fundamentals and market prices. The distinguishing features of the commodity, EME and structured credit markets described above have been strong increases in participation by financial intermediaries and end-investors;  relatively strong recent returns;  and relative illiquidity.  While developments in these markets may be warranted by fundamentals in each case, it is possible that they may also be characterised by a degree of exuberance.  If so, they may be a component of a gradual overaccumulation of exposures brought about by any material mispricing of risk;  or they may be vulnerable to a nearer-term adjustment which, in the presence of leverage, could potentially be quite abrupt. 56 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – The financial stability conjuncture and outlook 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 United States US LBO Europe European LBO US$ billions 1998 99 2000 01 02 03 04(a) Chart 2.18 Leveraged loan issuance Sources:  Loan Pricing Corporation and Bank calculations.

(c) June 2004 Review.  2.2 Hedge funds and leverage Inflows into hedge funds have continued at record levels, despite the relatively modest returns of many strategies recently (Chart 2.20 and Chart 2.2 1).  Low volatility and an absence of directional trends in many major markets for much of the year have contributed to an environment which many funds have found difficult.  To generate returns, as described above, some have been increasing their involvement in less efficient markets, where mispricing – and so positive risk-adjusted returns – may conceivably be more likely.  This has been especially marked in credit markets, where hedge funds have become more active in lending (for example second-lien tranches of syndicated loans) and distressed debt as well as CDO tranches.  Consistent with this, some hedge funds have moved into private-equity-like strategies;  and some private equity firms have set up hedge funds.  In a separate development, it seems that a few hedge funds have now established vehicles to write catastrophe reinsurance.  To some extent, such strategies obtain a return for illiquidity. As previous Reviews have noted, a combination of leverage, relatively illiquid assets and, in many cases, model-based approaches to trading and valuation may, in the event of material asset price shifts, exacerbate stressed conditions.  In such circumstances, much would depend on the maturity structure of funds’ liabilities.  Evidence here is mixed.  A number of the largest and most high-profile funds appear to have succeeded in lengthening – or maintaining – the lock-ins they are able to impose on their investors.  Others (perhaps particularly those reliant on investments by funds of hedge funds) appear still to offer their investors monthly, or quarterly, liquidity – and are thus potentially more at risk of sharp withdrawals of funds in the event of a change in sentiment.  Some intermediaries may offer more frequent liquidity to clients who invest in hedge-fund-linked products. Previous Reviews have highlighted the difficulty in measuring leverage in the hedge fund sector.  In part this is because of the absence of directly observable measures.  But it is also because leverage can take many different forms:  individual investors and funds of funds may be leveraged, as well as the funds themselves; and hedge funds may have ‘economic leverage’ , via derivatives or via assets that themselves embody leverage.1 Crude proxies for funded leverage, for example lending to the Cayman Islands, where many funds are domiciled, have continued to show strong increases (Chart 2.22).  Notwithstanding public reports of significant trading losses at individual large funds, market contacts have suggested that, taken as a whole, the fund sector is The financial stability conjuncture and outlook – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 57 (1) As discussed most recently in ‘Box 5:  Hedge fund industry leverage’ in the June 2004 Review, page 53. 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 1996 1995 1994 US$ billions + - Chart 2.20 Cumulative flows of capital into hedge funds(a) Source:  TASS Research.

Nevertheless, given strong growth and the apparent increase in ‘economic leverage’ , it seems plausible to believe that potential leverage in the hedge fund sector may have been increasing in recent years.  An important question is therefore whether investor expectations of hedge fund returns are moderating in line with the greater efficiency in markets potentially resulting from increased hedge fund activity and investment bank product innovation. 2.3 Major financial institutions Large complex financial institutions The large complex financial institutions (LCFIs)1 as a whole continue to be financially strong, although a number of challenges have become more apparent since the June 2004 Review.  In aggregate, the group continues to be highly profitable (Chart 2.23).  Judging from market-based indicators, there has been a moderate reduction in concern over both creditworthiness and profitability.  The price of protection against an LCFI default has fallen since the previous Review. Profitability has varied significantly across business lines. Traditional activities such as investment banking, particularly for the US LCFIs, have been subdued until recently.  In part this reflects conditions in primary financial markets, most notably mergers and acquisitions, and initial public offerings of equity. To maintain high profitability in aggregate, the LCFIs have relied on revenues from trading activities (Chart 2.24).  More recently, markets that have traded in tight ranges, and low and falling volatility, have been reflected in lower trading revenues.  In response, LCFIs in aggregate have increased their exposure to market risk (Chart 2.25), as measured by value-at-risk (VaR).2 Some, however, reduced their VaR.  But a fall in VaR does not necessarily indicate a reduction in the size of trading positions; it could simply be a mechanical effect of lower historical volatility being reflected in updates of the data sets that are used in many market risk systems. The LCFIs face a number of challenges.  First, as recent experience has emphasised, there is a risk of regulatory investigations and litigation.  As well as direct costs such as legal expenses (Chart 2.26) and the absorption of senior management’s time, there can be reputational consequences. Questions have been posed about the challenges inherent in 58 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) The December 2001 Review page 81 described the criteria used to determine an LCFI peer group.  It comprises:  ABN Amro, Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Société Générale and UBS. (2) VaR is an aggregate measure of downside risk, defined as the maximum loss over a target horizon such that there is a low, pre-specified probability that the actual loss will be larger.

These risks are not confined to the banking sector but can extend to some of the LCFIs’ most important counterparties, including two of the US Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs), Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and some global insurers. As noted above, the recent marked widening for a brief period of some insurance companies’ CDS premia illustrated the effect that regulatory and judicial investigations can have on their perceived credit standing.  For some, who are active as risk-taking intermediaries in global capital markets, maintaining a very high credit rating is intrinsic to their business model. Second, the rapid growth in structured credit markets has brought challenges.  Dealers’ back offices seem to have struggled to keep pace with front offices, with backlogs of unconfirmed trades.  There are questions about the models used, which have known limitations and are untested in stressed market conditions.  More generally, it is unclear to what extent these new markets would remain liquid in a less benign credit or trading environment.  On the one hand, active two-way markets with a wide range of participants now exist in most investment-grade single name CDSs and in the standardised CDS indices and index tranches.  Dealers are planning regular price fixings in these instruments to provide greater transparency, including reference prices for more complex derivatives.  And arbitrage between the portfolio and single-name credit markets, and between CDS, bond and loan markets, should help to underpin liquidity throughout the credit markets – for example, dealers could quickly move to exploit any misalignment between CDS premia and required returns on CDO tranches by structuring synthetic CDOs.  On the other hand, the markets remain untested in the face of a sharp widening of credit spreads or a sharp increase in default correlation.  The rapid growth of the structured credit markets, the narrowing of credit spreads and the wider ‘search for yield’ have drawn in many new participants during a period when modelling and operational infrastructure are still developing.  It is unclear how they would respond in stressed market conditions. Finally, LCFIs continue to adapt business models as competition reduces risk-adjusted returns in some markets.  In some products, firms compete primarily to gain market share and league table ranking.  For some while now, this has been most obvious in equity market block trades, often undertaken at narrow discounts, as highlighted in previous Reviews.1 As time passes, this seems to be part of a broader pattern of equity market intermediation involving more risk taking, making it slightly The financial stability conjuncture and outlook – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 59 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Q1 Q3 Q1 Q3 Q1 Q3 Q1 Q3 Q1 Q3 Maximum-minimum range Interquartile range Median 2000 03 Per cent 04 01 02 Chart 2.26 Professional fees paid by US LCFIs as a percentage of net revenues(a)(b) Sources:  Company reports and Bank calculations.

Notably, a number of LCFIs are increasing their involvement in commodity markets, either through adjustment of the composition of their trading risk (Chart 2.27) or through the purchase of commodity trading operations. Perhaps the most significant developments, under way for a while now, centre around the servicing of hedge funds.  In particular, competition to provide prime brokerage services has intensified (Box 6).  Some LCFIs have taken further steps into the hedge fund sector, for example through the outright purchase of funds. Such acquisitions, together with a more explicit focus on in-house hedge funds at some LCFIs, may simply be an extension of their asset management business and so bring further revenue diversification.  But experience suggests that to avoid costly mis-steps, acquisitions and expansion needs to be in line with long-term business strategy, and that appropriate risk management and controls need to be put in place and maintained. 2.4 Implications for the UK financial system Large UK-owned banks too are active in the international financial markets discussed above, through their trading, funding, underwriting, and investment activities.  Indeed, in the past three years some UK banks have increased their market activities as reflected in global league tables (especially bonds, syndicated loans, and foreign exchange).  Although volatile, dealing profits of large UK-owned banks have also grown noticeably as a proportion of total income (Chart 2.28).  This could be interpreted as another indication of greater financial market involvement.1 Counterparty credit risk UK banks have significant counterparty exposures to foreign-owned financial institutions, including the LCFIs discussed above.  Around a fifth of large UK-owned banks’ foreign on-balance-sheet claims are international claims against foreign banking sectors.2 Foreign-owned banks are also significant participants in the London unsecured interbank market (Chart 2.29), although the size of this participation has not changed materially since the June 2004 Review. 60 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) Dealing profits should, however, be interpreted with some caution.  Some banks, for example, include the net interest income earned on the dealing book as dealing income. Net interest income on the dealing book can be influenced by factors other than short-term financial market activity.  For example, if the yield curve is upward sloping and dealing positions are being funded at the short end of the yield curve, this will provide positive net interest income to dealing income. (2) See ‘Box 2:  UK-owned banks’ international exposures’ in the June 2004 Review, page 28. 10 12 14 16 18 1998 99 2000 01 02 03 04 Range Interquartile range Median Per cent 8 6 4 2 0 2 + - Chart 2.28 Large UK-owned banks’ dealing income as a percentage of operating income(a) Sources:  Published accounts and Bank calculations.

The financial stability conjuncture and outlook – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 61 As noted on pages 58–60, one of the challenges facing LCFIs is to continue to adapt their business models as risk-adjusted returns are apparently declining in some markets.  For many, this has included placing increased empasis on servicing hedge funds.  Competition among major banks and securities houses for prime brokerage mandates remains strong.  Prime brokerage in this context is a portmanteau term for a range of hedge fund services that may comprise many or all of:  extension of (mainly secured) credit;  securities lending;  trade executions;  cash management;  clearing and settlement;  custody;  reporting, accounting and other fund administration services;  technology platforms; and capital introduction (introducing potential investors to hedge fund managers).1 The core of the prime brokerage relationship is financing of hedge funds’ positions and clearing and settlement of their trades. Three broad categories of prime brokerage can be identified, although there is some overlap between them and delineations may not in practice be clear-cut: ● Equity prime brokerage, sometimes referred to as ‘traditional’ prime brokerage, comprises, for the most part, secured financing of long equity positions, securities lending to cover short positions and associated custody services. ● Synthetic prime brokerage is a more recent development and typically involves enabling hedge funds to take positions using contracts for differences or total return swaps.  The funds might otherwise have taken these positions by buying or selling short the underlying securities.  The broker may hedge its resulting positions by trading in the underlying securities, or finding offsetting positions in the rest of its book.  For new entrants to the industry, this may be part of a strategy to become an additional prime broker to the fund’s main broker: this way, they can get funds’ business without offering administrative and ancillary services. ● Fixed-income prime brokerage is targeted at macro and relative value fixed-income funds.  It combines elements of the two categories above, and involves providing a service covering some or all of bonds, repo, over-the-counter derivatives (such as swaps), foreign exchange and futures clearing.  The exchange-traded derivatives and over-the-counter derivatives aspects of both fixed-income and traditional prime brokerage are sometimes referred to as derivatives prime brokerage.  As part of this service, the prime broker may clear over-the-counter derivatives with other dealers by interposing itself between the fund and the dealer;  that way, the prime broker has the potential counterparty exposure to the dealer. Challenges for prime brokers Risk management by prime brokers is generally thought to have improved in the past few years and many hedge funds – particularly among the largest – have themselves been increasing their own risk management capabilities.  Market contacts, both in major banks and securities houses and in hedge funds, have suggested that there is a general determination in the industry ‘not to repeat the 1 998 experience’ .  Nevertheless, and particularly in the context of competition among prime brokers, a number of challenges remain. Concerns have been expressed that competition is resulting in initial margin requirements (applied by prime brokers to hedge funds’ positions) being relaxed.  This is perhaps especially the case in synthetic and fixed-income prime brokerage, where much of the value comes from selling derivatives to hedge funds .  The challenge for prime brokers is therefore to maintain an appropriate balance between the interests of the firms’ trading desks and those of prudent credit control. Prime brokers need to assure themselves that they have sufficient scope to ensure that their margin requirements are adequate in changing circumstances.  Some prime brokers have reported pressure from hedge funds to give a commitment that margin terms will remain constant for a defined period, or to relinquish so-called ‘termination events’ that allow the prime broker to demand repayment of borrowing if the net asset value of the fund falls below Box 6:  Prime brokerage (1) See ‘Box 5:  Prime brokerage’ in the June 2004 Review, page 56.  Regulatory ‘large exposures’ returns submitted to the FSA1 capture both on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet instruments.  They show that large UK-owned banks have material counterparty exposures to LCFIs, investment banks, and other internationally active financial institutions.  Furthermore, collectively these exposures are of the same order of magnitude as their exposures to other large UK-owned banks (Chart 2.30). Exposures to Japanese and German financial firms (excluding LCFIs) are more modest. UK banks’ wholesale market activities also result in counterparty exposures to non-financial companies.  One channel is through UK banks’ increasing share of syndicated lending (Chart 2.3 1), which is predominantly to non-financial firms.  Another channel is via their role as sponsors in the asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) market, where their participation has grown 62 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – The financial stability conjuncture and outlook a certain trigger level – provided the hedge fund continues to meet its obligations to the prime broker in that period.  From the point of view of the funds, the motivation is to help them manage their liquidity risks, especially in stressed circumstances.  But prime brokers need to weigh that against their own need for flexibility to provide themselves with an adequate margin cushion in circumstances when market volatility increases. As prime brokers expand the range of instruments in which they can provide a service, so the number of positions across which they can offer margin offsets, based on past covariances in the positions (so-called VaR-based margining) increases.  While the motivation for this is based on prudent risk management principles, prime brokers will need to be sure that the terms they apply reflect their potential exposures in stressed conditions;  and that their ability to net their exposures to funds in the event of default, potentially across different legal jurisdictions, is enforceable. A related point, noted in the June 2004 Review, is that many funds – particularly the larger – have a number of prime brokers.  From the funds’ perspective, this is a prudent attempt to diversify their sources of liquidity. But individual prime brokers need to consider the implications for them of hedge funds having multiple prime brokers, and their risk management approach where they lack a comprehensive picture of a fund’s overall leverage and any concentration of its positions. As discussed in the main text, hedge funds are said to be increasingly involved in less liquid and more ‘exotic’ markets, where positions may be taken in bespoke structured derivative instruments or in illiquid securities or loans, such as distressed debt. Prime brokers need to judge on what terms to provide financing for these positions.  Considerations include whether the fund’s leverage and the quality of its capital (for example the lock-in arrangements that apply to investors) are appropriate given the illiquidity of its assets. These less liquid markets tend to be relatively specialised, and there may only be a small number of banks and securities houses actively participating and so providing liquidity.  In this context, a few banks and dealers are conducting ‘major player exit’ stress tests to try to calibrate the effects on their positions – including exposures within their prime broker operation – of another bank or dealer (or large hedge fund) leaving particular markets.  Other banks and securities houses may wish to consider, and similarly attempt to model, their own exposures in this context. (1) For regulatory purposes, ‘large exposures’ are defined as the largest twenty exposures equal to or under one-year maturity that are both larger than £250 million in size and over 5% of the Large Exposures Capital Base (LECB), plus any other longer-term exposures that equal or exceed 10% of LECB.  LECB is defined as Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital less any regulatory deductions. 29% 37% 4% 1% 29% UK-owned Non-UK owned LCFI Other German Japanese Other Chart 2.30 Large UK-owned banks’ ‘large exposures’ to financial firms, September 2004 Sources:  Bank of England and FSA regulatory returns.  significantly in recent years.  In both cases, however, the ultimate risk to UK banks will depend on the extent to which exposures have been hedged or sold on, which is difficult to assess. Market and liquidity risk Some UK banks allocate a material proportion of their economic capital to cover market risk (although less than that allocated to credit risk).  Market risks are typically classified as being in the ‘trading’ or ‘banking’ book, an accounting distinction also used by banking regulators. The trading book The largest UK-owned banks all disclose market risk in the trading book using a value-at-risk (VaR) method.  Interest rate (or yield curve) risk continues to make up the majority of their VaR, with the rest consisting mostly of foreign exchange and equity risk.  Average VaR as a percentage of quarterly earnings was little changed for UK banks in the six months to 2004 H1, following falls during 2003.  VaR remains low for most UK banks when compared with US and European LCFIs (Chart 2.32). However, it is well recognised that standard measures of VaR should be interpreted with some caution.  They provide no information on the nature of potential losses beyond the reported confidence threshold, and for trading positions in particularly illiquid markets (such as distressed debt, high-yield credit and Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) arbitrage strategies) the assumed holding period may not provide a sufficient time to liquidate positions.  To address these types of issues, in their internal risk management banks tend to use a range of different VaR assumptions, and supplement VaR analysis with both stress tests and scenario analysis of market prices and market liquidity. The banking book Although increasing marginally, large UK-owned banks’ trading books still make up the minority of total assets (Chart 2.33).  But UK banks also take market risk in their banking books, to the extent that they run mismatches between the maturities and interest rate terms of their deposits and lending. Disclosure of market risk in the banking books of UK banks is made according to Financial Reporting Standard 1 3 (FRS1 3), which requires that net liabilities open to repricing at different maturities are reported.  However, as discussed in the June 2004 Review, this measure has a number of pitfalls, including a focus on contractual rather than behavioural maturities (which may differ because of factors such as mortgage prepayment and current accounts not being repriced regularly). Reflecting such weaknesses, for internal purposes UK banks use a number of alternative methods of measuring market risk in the banking book, including VaR, stress testing and scenario analysis.

The financial stability conjuncture and outlook – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 65 3 UK financial sector resilience:  key points The UK financial system remains robust.  The profitability and capitalisation of UK-owned banks has improved further since June, and their buffers of capital and high-quality liquid assets remain above the regulatory minima, strengthening the capacity of banks to manage the risks outlined in this Review.  The operating environment for non-bank financial intermediaries, particularly for those in the life insurance sector, has also improved. Some aspects of the operations of UK financial institutions, nevertheless, have implications for systemic stability should key market and credit risks crystallise.  In particular: ● The growth of UK-owned banks’ lending to households and firms continues to outpace the growth of funding from these sources.  Although the ensuing ‘customer funding gap’ has stabilised following a steady increase between 1 998 and 2003, it continues to be financed, in part, by short-term borrowing from foreign-owned banks in the interbank market.  While UK-owned banks are developing alternative, longer-term, sources of funding, liquidity management could become more challenging should any individual bank come under financial pressure; ● A growing proportion of UK-owned banks’ income is being derived from non-interest income.  Although there are benefits from diversifying income sources, non-interest income could be more volatile than interest income and may be more susceptible to market risk; ● The trading and funding relationships between financial institutions, as well as the direct counterparty exposures of banks to each other, mean that shocks in one sector can rapidly spread across the financial system as a whole.  These shocks can be amplified if there is a shared dependence on the liquidity of certain markets. ● Attempts to manage exposures linking financial institutions (for example, through off-balance-sheet exchange-traded derivative transactions) need to be pursued carefully to avoid excessive concentration of risks building up within particular parts of the financial system.  Exposures between banks through the payment and settlement system also need similar management.  Continued efforts to mitigate risks in the financial infrastructure important to UK wholesale financial markets – such as CREST, LCH.Clearnet Ltd and the Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) system – are important in this regard.  3 UK financial sector resilience As discussed in Chapters 1 and 2, the past six months has been a relatively benign period for UK financial stability.  Credit losses suffered by large UK-owned banks remain subdued:  new provisions have fallen;  mortgage arrears and write-off rates remain at or near historical lows;  and the number of UK corporate insolvencies has fallen further.  World economic growth has been very strong in 2004.  And financial asset price volatility has been subdued. However vulnerabilities still remain:  UK banks’ credit card and commercial property lending growth have been particularly rapid;  UK household indebtedness continues to increase relative to income; and there are still risks in the external environment.  In international financial markets, some intermediaries and investors have continued their ‘search for yield’,  leaving them vulnerable to credit events, sharper-than-expected interest rate rises and instability in the pattern of global capital flows. 3.1 The large UK-owned banking sector1 Market assessment Market indicators suggest that there are few concerns amongst market participants about the resilience of large UK-owned banks.  The FTSE 350 Bank Index has risen by around 5% since the June 2004 Review, broadly in line with the FTSE 350 Index. The expected volatility of UK banks’ share prices, as derived from option prices, has remained relatively low (Chart 3.1).  And the implied probability of default of UK banks – inferred from a model based on the behaviour of bank equity prices – has fallen further since the June 2004 Review, touching its lowest level since April 1 998.2 That is consistent with more direct measures of the credit risk associated with UK banks.  Credit default swap (CDS) premia for large UK-owned banks, for example, have fallen since the June 2004 Review, and remain low compared with those for US and European banks and UK non-bank companies (Chart 3.2).  However, market indicators should be interpreted with caution.  As discussed in Chapter 2, some of the recent 66 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) This analysis of the UK banking sector concentrates on the ten largest UK-owned banks, which together take 85% of deposits from UK-resident households and private non-financial companies.  In November, Abbey National, the sixth largest UK-owned bank, was acquired by Banco Santander, the largest Spanish-owned bank.  Abbey has been retained in the peer group of large UK-owned banks used in this Review, given that the acquisition occurred after the period of the latest financial results (2004 H1).  The June 2005 Review will revisit the criteria used to select a peer group of banks for UK banking sector surveillance. (2) This refers to a Merton-style model in which the underlying value of a bank’s assets is assumed to follow a stochastic process estimated from the market value of the bank’s equity price and other outstanding liabilities.  For the purpose of the model, non-equity liabilities are assumed to comprise only customer deposits. 0 20 40 60 80 Jan. Apr. July Oct. Jan. Apr. July Oct. Jan. Apr.

(b) June 2004 Review.  general reduction in spreads and implied volatilities may be due to lower risk premia, perhaps associated with investors’ ‘search for yield’ , as well as improvements in economic fundamentals. Credit rating agencies’ evaluations provide another indicator of the perceived strength of banking sectors; in principle, these should not be affected in the same way by changing risk premia. Financial Strength Ratings reflect an assessment of a bank’s strength on a stand-alone basis.1 These ratings remain high for large UK-owned banks, in line with those in the mid-1 990s and with current ratings for most foreign-owned large complex financial institutions (LCFIs) (Chart 3.3).2 Profitability and capitalisation The large UK-owned banking sector’s profitability and capitalisation remains high by the standards of the past 1 5 to 20 years, as shown in Box 7 .  Reported profits and capital for the sector have also increased since the June 2004 Review. Profitability The median return on equity of large UK-owned banks rose to 27 .3% in 2004 H1, from 24.1% in 2003 (Chart B, in Box 7).  The dispersion of profitability across the large UK-owned banking sector narrowed – the single large UK-owned bank that made losses in 2002 and 2003 returned to profit in 2004 H1. Pre-tax profit margins for the sector rose in the first half of the year, because of reductions in both the aggregate cost-income ratio and new provisions (Chart 3.4):  the former fell from 54.0% for the full year in 2003 to 51.4% in 2004 H1, and the latter fell to around 0.35% of total loans (Chart A, in Box 7).  Indeed, profitability in 2004 H1 was either above or near the upper end of Consensus forecasts for the majority of the large UK-owned banks. The increase in overall profit margins, however, masked a continued change in the composition of income (Chart 3.5). Net interest income grew by just 1.7% in the first half of 2004, compared with total income growth of 7%.  Net interest margins have experienced a steady decline over the past 20 years (Chart 3.6), and fell further in the year to 2004 H1.  The impact on net interest income was offset in 2004 H1 by rapid lending growth (see Chapter 1).  A reduction in this lending growth would put downward pressure on UK banks’ income.

They exclude consideration of government support to the rated bank, and hence reflect an assessment of strength on a stand-alone basis.

The ten banks have on average since the beginning of 2001 held 98% of UK-owned banks’ assets and 87% of all households’ and companies’ deposits.  However, the choice of a static peer group based on the current structure of the banking system is not well suited to undertaking long-run comparisons (given changes in the composition of the group over time).  Some of the ten largest banks at the end of 2004 H1 were converted building societies and had been involved in mergers and acquisitions. This box introduces a new dynamic peer group designed to permit longer-term comparison of UK banks.  It comprises the ten largest UK-owned banks at each year end.  Annual re-selection has the advantage that the peer group reflects changes in the structure of the banking system and banks’ organic growth.  The peer group has been constructed between 1 986 and 2004 H1 (with the start date reflecting Thomson Financial’s coverage of banks’ annual accounts information).  The 1 9-year period includes a range of different economic developments, including the banks’ recognition of losses made in the 1 980s Less Developed Country (LDC) debt crisis,1 the early 1 990s recession and the more recent benign economic environment. The peer group can be used to investigate the current resilience of large UK-owned banks in a longer-term context.  The first major development evident in the dataset was several large UK-owned banks’ recognition of losses made in the 1 980s LDC debt crisis.  This is reflected in the increase in the upper quartile of the new provisions ratio in 1 987 and 1 989 (Chart A).  The recession of the early 1 990s was felt more broadly, with the median and interquartile range of the new provisions ratio increasing to a peak in 1 991–92.  The subsequent recovery in economic activity saw a fall in new provisioning and increase in profitability.  The large banks’ return on equity has remained relatively high ever since, reflecting the favourable macroeconomic backdrop and the absence of other major shocks (Chart B).  Since the UK banking regulator’s implementation of the Basel Accord from end-1 989, the large banks’ Tier 1 ratios have increased steadily and in 2004 H1 stood well above the 4% minimum (Chart C).

Growth in non-interest income, however, has remained strong, at around 1 5% in the first half of 2004.  This could reflect a change in strategy in the light of falling interest margins, or a change in pricing structure – setting lower interest margins but imposing higher non-interest charges on customers.  Net fees and commissions rose by 5% in the year to 2004 H1, while dealing income rose by 17%. Capitalisation The large UK-owned banks’ published total and Tier 1 capital ratios rose marginally in 2004 H1, and remain well above regulatory minima.  So-called ‘prime Tier 1’ capital – which excludes components of Tier 1 capital that carry debt-servicing obligations – is also reported to be high (Chart 3.7).1 UK banks with life insurance subsidiaries (bancassurers) face a potential change in accounting rules that is likely to reduce the level of capital reported as Tier 1.  Bancassurers are currently permitted to recognise an estimate of future profits from their life insurance businesses as an asset for accounting purposes.  In July, the UK Accounting Standards Board published Financial Reporting Exposure Draft (FRED) 34, which proposes to restrict this practice.2 Funding and liquidity The characteristics of a bank’s funding and other liabilities influence its potential vulnerability to liquidity risk.  To remain robust, banks require a sufficient stock of liquid assets to meet calls on liquidity as they arise. Funding As noted in recent Reviews, the growth of most large UK-owned banks’ lending to households and non-financial companies (or ‘customers’) outpaced the growth of funding from these sources between 2001 and 2003.3 The resulting ‘customer funding gap’ has been filled by issuing debt securities and borrowing in the interbank market (Chart 3.8).  A sizeable proportion of the large UK-owned banking sector’s net borrowing in the interbank market is obtained from foreign-owned banks.  In times of market-wide stress, such short-term wholesale liabilities could prove more vulnerable to sudden withdrawal, and therefore pose greater liquidity risks. The financial stability conjuncture and outlook – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 69 (1) Previous Reviews have argued that some forms of capital are likely to be more effective than others in helping banks absorb losses should they arise.  Some forms of capital, such as subordinated debt, protect depositors but, from the perspective of system robustness, carry debt-servicing obligations that could prove difficult to defer in times of stress.  Other types of capital, such as shareholders’ equity, provide the flexibility for banks to hold back payments to capital holders and instead use the funds as a buffer. (2) If enacted, it is unclear whether FRED 34 would be applied first for the accounting period ending December 2004 or later.

Over the past year, however, the growth rates of deposits from customers and of customer lending have converged (Chart 3.9). The customer funding gap was therefore broadly unchanged in 2004 H1.  Nevertheless, the existing gap still requires funding. Some UK-owned banks have continued to develop alternative, long-term, funding sources.  Since the June 2004 Review, there has been further UK covered bond issuance, bringing the total issuance to €1 4.25 billion (£9.8 billion) since the first UK covered bond issue in July 2003.1 Net flows of securitisations remain a small proportion of the sector’s overall funding, only representing around 1.1% of total assets in the year to September (Chart 3.10).2 Liquidity Banks hold a buffer of high-quality liquid assets to remain robust against the liquidity risk inherent in their funding sources and other liabilities.  In the UK, the regulatory minimum for liquid assets is determined by the sterling stock liquidity ratio (SSLR). Since the June 2004 Review, SSLRs have remained above the regulatory minimum of 100%.  Excluding holdings of other banks’ certificates of deposit (CDs) – which, as ‘inside’ rather than ‘outside’ assets, may not help the banking system as a whole in the event of a system-wide liquidity shock – the median SSLR has also remained above 100% (Chart 3.1 1). The SSLR is based on sterling outflows.  An alternative indicator is the ratio of liquid assets to those liabilities (in whatever currency) that might be classified as vulnerable to sudden withdrawal, as derived from data in published accounts. According to this indicator, most large UK-owned banks hold roughly the same level of ‘liquid assets’ as their stock of ‘vulnerable liabilities’ , although the ratio has fallen in recent years (Chart 3.12).  This measure encompasses assets and liabilities in all currencies, but it has other limitations.  It is dependent on the exact definition of ‘liquid assets’ and ‘vulnerable liabilities’ used, and is not based on empirical estimates of potential outflows. 70 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) As discussed in the June 2004 Review, the recent development of covered bond issuance represents an extension of the UK mortgage-backed securities market.  UK covered bonds are structured in a broadly similar way to the well-established German pfandbriefe market:  long-term securities (with 5-to 1 5-year maturities), backed by pools of mortgages, issued in euro (with foreign exchange risk to the bank hedged as a matter of course), and offered to European investors. (2) In September 2004, the FSA sent a letter to the British Bankers’ Association outlining depositor protection issues that arise from covered bond issuance, highlighting that the regulatory treatment of covered bonds was under review.  These securities could weaken the position of depositors in an insolvency, as covered bond holders have a preferential claim to the assets pledged to the covered bond pool. 5 0 5 10 15 20 25 2000 01 02 03 04 Loans to banks Loans to customers Deposits from banks Deposits from customers Percentage change on a year earlier - + Chart 3.9 Large UK-owned banks’ asset and funding growth Sources:  Published accounts and Bank calculations. 50 70 90 110 130 150 170 190 210 1999 2000 01 02 03 04 Interquartile range without CDs Median SSLR Median SSLR without CDs Per cent 0 Chart 3.11 Large UK-owned banks’ sterling stock liquidity ratios Source:  FSA regulatory returns. 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 Dec. 1997 Dec. 98 Dec. 99 Dec. 2000 Dec. 01 Dec. 02 Dec. 03 Sep. 04 Lending to non-financial companies Unsecured lending to individuals Secured lending to individuals Per cent Chart 3.10 Annual net flows of loan transfers and securitisations by nature of underlying loan, as a percentage of total assets(a) Source:  Bank of England.

Considering only UK-resident activities, the article concludes that a number of non-bank financial sectors are potentially important for financial stability, including securities dealers, non-life insurers, life insurers, pension funds, and ‘other finance providers’ .1 Although UK-resident, some of the non-bank financial intermediaries described above – such as securities dealers and non-life insurers – are largely foreign-owned.  Global market price indices are one indicator of the perceived robustness of these intermediaries.  Since the June 2004 Review, equity prices of global non-bank financial sectors have risen (Chart 3.1 3).  CDS premia also remain low for most global non-bank financial firms, suggesting their perceived resilience to shocks remains strong. The risks to these global intermediaries are discussed in Chapter 2. In autumn 2002 and spring 2003, UK life insurers were adversely affected by sharp declines in UK equity prices, in some cases prompting capital injections by their owners.  But this year, the operating environment of UK life insurers has improved. Aggregate profits of the five largest UK-owned life insurers increased by 26% in the year to 2004 H1.  The Association of British Insurers (ABI) also reports a 5.5% annual increase in new sales of products in 2004 Q3, although sales still remain 10% below 2002 peaks (Chart 3.1 4). ‘Other finance providers’ – such as mortgage credit companies, factoring companies, credit grantors and leasing corporations – play a material role in lending to UK households.  The majority of secured lending by these finance providers is undertaken by companies that are subsidiaries of UK banking groups.  As such, the strength of this sector is captured, in part, in large UK-owned banks’ consolidated group accounts, discussed above. 3.3 Links between financial institutions Aggregate indicators of the strength of the financial sector are insufficient by themselves to provide a full assessment of the ability of the sector to withstand adverse shocks.  Links between financial institutions create the potential for shocks that hit individual intermediaries, or particular parts of the financial The financial stability conjuncture and outlook – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 71 (1) Corder, M (2004), ‘Assessing risks from UK non-bank financial sectors’ , Bank of England Financial Stability Review, December. 0 10 20 30 40 50 Banks Life insurance Asset managers Total market June 2004 Review Dec. 2001 Review Per cent Securities dealers Non-life insurance Chart 3.13 Percentage change in global equity price indices(a) since previous Reviews Sources: Thomson Financial Datastream and Bank calculations.

Funding and trading exposures Financial institutions are linked through a number of channels, including funding activities in interbank markets and trading relationships in financial markets. Financial market liquidity and concentration Large UK-owned banks and other financial institutions – such as LCFIs, securities dealers and hedge funds – are active in a number of financial markets, and so are exposed to market risk, as discussed in Chapter 2.  Although measures of large UK-owned banks’ value at risk (VaR) relative to income are low compared with US and European LCFIs, VaR calculations usually assume that markets do not become illiquid or disorderly.  Hence they do not reflect links via banks’ shared dependence on the liquidity of markets.  Some of these markets are highly concentrated, with a relatively small number of intermediaries, each with a large market share. On-balance-sheet counterparty exposures Counterparty links within the banking sector are particularly important given the high degree of interconnection in wholesale banking markets.  As a result, even though the large UK-owned banking sector is a net borrower in the interbank market (as discussed earlier), gross unsecured interbank loans and advances are a large category of interbank exposure, amounting to more than two and a half times Tier 1 capital (Chart 3.1 5).  By contrast, on-balance-sheet exposures to non-bank financial sectors are less material.  The largest on-balance-sheet exposure is via secured lending to securities dealers, which are predominantly US-owned (Chart 3.1 6). Off-balance-sheet counterparty exposures Counterparty links also occur through off-balance-sheet activities, including both over-the-counter (OTC) and exchange-traded derivatives.  According to the recently published Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Triennial Survey, the volume of global OTC currency and interest rate derivatives turnover has more than doubled in the past three years.  The resultant risks are primarily managed through netting and collateral agreements.  As a result, large UK-owned banks’ net exposures via OTC derivatives remain small compared with exposures through gross unsecured interbank loans (which by contrast are not netted against interbank deposits) (Chart 3.1 5). Exchange-traded derivatives provide another avenue for banks to reduce counterparty exposures to each other.

House (LCH), for example, plays an integral role in clearing securities and derivative transactions, as illustrated by the initial margin deposited with LCH by its members (Chart 3.17).  The central counterparty must itself meet high standards of risk management.1 Payment and settlement exposures Large UK-owned banks participate in payment and settlement systems both in the United Kingdom and overseas.  The two largest UK payment systems by value, CREST for sterling securities settlement and CHAPS sterling for cash settlement, are real-time gross settlement systems, which do not give rise to credit exposures between settlement banks (Chart 3.1 8). However, exposures of settlement banks to non-members, arising while those customers’ payment instructions are being processed, still need to be managed.2 The Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) system, which was launched in September 2002, helps reduce foreign exchange settlement risk between system users by settling their transactions on a payment-versus-payment basis.  With a few exceptions due to seasonal declines in market activity, values of foreign exchange transactions settled in CLS have continued to increase (Chart 3.1 9), but a significant amount is still settled outside CLS.3 The Hong Kong dollar, Korean won, New Zealand dollar and South African rand are due to be included in the CLS system by early 2005, increasing the number of settled currencies to 1 5. In October 2003, CREST broadened the range of securities that it settles to include money market instruments.  Since then, there has been rapid growth in the value of US dollar settlement in CREST.  The resulting US dollar obligations between settlement banks are not settled in real time over the Bank of England’s accounts.  Settlement instead takes place over accounts in the United States, with exposures between pairs of settlement banks persisting until those bilateral payments have been made.  The settlement banks and CREST, with the support of the Bank of England, are exploring ways of reducing the credit risk that this process entails. As well as minimising settlement exposures between banks, well designed payment and settlement systems can reduce the threat of system-wide disruptions.  Measures to strengthen these key elements of the financial infrastructure are among the issues covered in the following article in this Review.

Analysing how regulatory arrangements can improve the resilience of the financial system in the face of such risks is one strand of the Bank’s work on strengthening financial infrastructure.  A second strand seeks to ensure that payment and settlement systems are designed in a way that helps to prevent financial difficulties from spreading between financial institutions. Disintermediation and the future reform of prudential regulation The traditional business of banking is to intermediate between depositors and borrowers.  In recent years, there has been a pronounced trend towards financial disintermediation; examples include securitisation, growth of corporate bond markets and credit risk transfer through loan sales or credit derivatives.  The resulting increased dispersion of financial risks has many benefits.  The development and deepening of markets for a wide range of risks (interest rate, credit and volatility, for example) create welfare gains from a more efficient allocation of capital, and benefits financial and macroeconomic stability through the greater dispersion of risk.  As US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has commented,1 the benign nature of the 2000 economic downturn may in part be attributable to this phenomenon.  But these benefits are put at risk if financial regulation or accounting standards fail to keep pace with financial innovation.  Outdated regulation or standards that fail to recognise the economic substance of transactions can slow the growth of markets for risk, either by reducing the benefits that flow from risk transfer or by diverting resources towards the non-productive exploitation of arbitrage opportunities. The Basel I standards for capital adequacy, for example, do not make fine distinctions between the level of credit risk on loans to different borrowers. While the introduction of internationally-agreed minimum capital standards greatly strengthened banking systems, this lack of risk sensitivity also created an incentive for banks to retain higher risk exposures in the banking book, while securitising or hedging exposures to lower risk borrowers.  This arbitrage distorted the market for credit risk, because a bank’s choice of which exposures to retain and which to hedge was, in part, driven by the cost of the disproportionate level of regulatory capital that had to be held against better quality credit risks, relative to the expected returns on those risks. Prudential regulation of credit risk The Basel II framework has made great progress in bringing prudential regulation of credit risk in the banking book up to date.  The new framework seeks to link capital requirements more closely to risk and to achieve a degree of neutrality of treatment of on and off-balance-sheet exposures.  In this way, the framework supports sound and efficient credit risk management within banks.  And both objectives, address distortions of the type discussed above. For example, the framework contains a new treatment of securitisation of assets.  Securitisation is a well-established form of disintermediation.  But one of the newer developments in the market for credit is the growth of credit derivatives.  Products such as The continued stability of the financial system relies on robust infrastructure.  In particular, effective regulation of financial institutions and strong risk management within payment, clearing and settlement systems reduce both the likelihood and severity of episodes of financial instability.  This article describes recent developments on these fronts. Strengthening financial infrastructure (1) Speech to the Conference on Bank Structure and Competition, Chicago, Illinois, 8 May 2003.  credit default swaps now complement more traditional guarantees and insurance contracts in facilitating the transfer of credit risk to those agents able to bear and manage it most efficiently. In principle, the growth of the market in credit derivatives is beneficial for both economic welfare and financial stability.  However, it presents multiple challenges for prudential regulation.  One of these challenges is part of a wider issue, which is how to assess the risks that arise in the trading book when it acts as the conduit for the dispersion of risks. Trading of all forms of derivatives creates counterparty credit exposures which persist for the life of the contracts; credit derivatives, while often a tool for reducing concentrations of credit risk, may also create direct credit exposures.  And the inclusion of illiquid positions in the trading book – for example certain tranches of collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) or loans temporarily warehoused ahead of securitisation – brings with it market and credit risks which do not fit comfortably within the current market risk regime.  The Basel II framework concentrates on the banking book, so these issues are being treated in a separate Trading Book Review. This Review is being undertaken jointly by the Basel Committee and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which is a welcome recognition of the need to integrate the prudential regulation of both commercial and investment banks. The second challenge is to devise a prudential treatment for loans or other credit exposures in the banking book that are hedged by credit protection. This is an area in which the mid-year text of the Basel II framework currently applies the ‘substitution’ approach, which essentially assumes that a hedged exposure becomes a direct exposure to the provider of credit protection.  This is a conservative treatment, because it does not take account of the ‘double default’ effect:  in order for a bank to suffer a loss on a hedged loan, both the original borrower and the provider of credit protection must default.  So, with the exception of the special case where the two defaults are perfectly correlated, the hedged loan is less risky than a direct exposure to either the original borrower or the protection provider.  The question of when to recognise the double default effect has been included in the remit of the Trading Book Review, although it clearly applies primarily to banking book exposures. It is in principle attractive to recognise the double default effect in capital requirements for a broad range of transactions.  It would increase risk sensitivity and establish neutrality between the different forms that credit protection can take, and so avoid retarding or distorting the development of the market in credit risk.  However, a substantial degree of conservatism must be embedded in the treatment adopted, and this inevitably will limit the scope and degree of recognition.  Neither supervisors nor firms can robustly estimate the values under stressed conditions of the correlations that are required as parameters of a quantitative estimate of double default effects.  There must therefore be substantial margins for error in the estimates of correlation used. And the scope of recognition must also exclude those transactions where it is not possible to rule out, with a reasonable degree of certainty, that there is no material economic link (direct or indirect) between borrower and protection provider:  in those cases, it is only prudent to use the substitution approach. There are also systemic concerns over introducing too broad a scope for recognition of double default effects at this stage in the development of what cannot yet be considered a mature market.  Some credit risk transfer will redistribute risk to other regulated financial firms:  policymakers need to be sure that any reduction in aggregate system capital reflects the actual reduction in aggregate risk to the financial system that has occurred.  And some of the risk transfer will be to non-financial firms, representing complete disintermediation.  Policy makers will continue to need to be sure that this represents a genuine transfer of credit risk:  that non-financial providers of credit protection will be able to meet their obligations under stressed circumstances. Notwithstanding any reform of the regulatory treatment, accounting standards do not currently deal well with the hedging of credit risk.  Specifically, the hedge accounting rules of IAS 39 impose strict criteria which may prevent some credit derivatives which are being used as hedges, from being accounted for as such.  In these cases, the derivative and the loan would probably not be measured on the same basis.  There are two possible consequences to this, both of them undesirable.  Firms that are concerned about volatility of reported profits or asset values may be reluctant to engage in credit risk transfer, despite the economic benefits.  That could Strengthening financial infrastructure – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 75  slow the growth of the market, and delay the resulting welfare gains.  Alternatively, firms that do hedge credit risk may transfer illiquid credit exposures, together with full or partial credit hedges, to the trading book, where they can be marked to market. Such a practice creates a problem that will be discussed in the next section.  This example illustrates the need for both prudential regulation and accounting standards to evolve in parallel if the benefits of financial innovation are to be fully realised. The trading book boundary The issue facing the Trading Book Review that potentially has the most far-reaching consequences for the future development of regulation is the treatment of the non-traditional assets, characterised by low liquidity, that are increasingly allocated to the trading books of banks. The Basel II framework defines the trading book as consisting ‘of positions in financial instruments and commodities held either with trading intent or in order to hedge other elements of the trading book.’ However, banking regulators have noted a trend towards the inclusion in banks’ trading books of a widening range of instruments and positions, some of which may be relatively illiquid.  This trend may have a number of causes, including the focus by some banking organisations on an investment banking business model, increased trading book hedging of traditional banking book positions, and risk management or capital incentives for placing positions in the trading book as opposed to the banking book.  It is also in part motivated by accounting standards that place artificial constraints (in the sense that they are unrelated to economic substance) on the extent to which fair value can substitute for historical valuation, and so encourage the reassignment of assets to different parts of the balance sheet.  The implications of hedge accounting rules in IAS 39 have been discussed above. An example that works in the opposite direction is the US accounting interpretation EITF Issue 03-1 on asset impairment:  before recent amendments, this might possibly have had the consequence of encouraging the switching of liquid, marketable securities (eg US Treasuries) into the held-to-maturity book, in order to avoid certain impairment charges. Securities regulators, meanwhile, note that while investment banks traditionally book most of their exposures in the trading book, some of these positions may be relatively illiquid.  More generally, market developments since the 1 996 Market Risk Amendment to the Basel I Accord (such as continued strong growth in OTC derivatives markets, especially in ‘exotic’ products) have probably contributed to illiquid assets accounting for a higher proportion of firms’ trading books.  And even instruments that are normally liquid can become illiquid if a large position is held by a single firm.  The final section covers these and other broader liquidity issues, and considers the need for responses by firms and authorities. The immediate issue that faces the Trading Book Review is the correct combination of valuation adjustment and Value-at-Risk (VaR) holding period to apply to an illiquid position, in order to provide a realistic estimate of the loss that might be incurred in the process of selling or hedging that position.  It will be important to achieve an improved treatment for exotic derivatives whose risk profile is not accurately captured by standard VaR, but this task is outside the scope of what the Review can achieve in the time available. Looking beyond the work of the Review, it is not clear where to draw the dividing line between trading and banking books:  that divide is increasingly an artefact of regulatory and accounting treatments, rather than the reflection of an underlying economic reality. Seeking to sustain it in the long term risks the growth of perverse incentives.  What underlies the need to define a treatment for illiquid positions or exotic derivatives in the trading book is the growing unreliability of the neat identifications that, broadly speaking, capital adequacy standards make of banking book with credit risk and trading book with market risk.  The challenge for the future reform of regulation is to recognise credit and market risk wherever they occur in one firm or, indeed, in the financial system as a whole. Implications for liquidity These trading book developments have implications not only for market and credit risk but also for liquidity risk.  There are implications for liquidity in two senses:  market liquidity – the ability to transform assets into cash without a significant price discount or ‘one way’ markets developing;  and institutional liquidity – the ability of firms to provide payment when contracts are due, whether routinely from management of cash flows and access to money 76 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – Strengthening financial infrastructure  markets or, in times of pressure, from a cushion of liquid assets. As Sir Andrew Large outlined recently,1 the greater holding of illiquid assets (as part of the search for yield) is just one of the recent developments that may have heightened market liquidity risk.  Trading strategies based on a similar rationale could increase the prospect of one-way markets developing and market liquidity evaporating across a variety of markets in response to a given shock;  and with new products and globalisation, the complexity of markets has increased, raising questions about the robustness of liquidity in the face of shocks.  Such issues can crystallise by impacting upon financial institutions’ balance sheets and impairing their ability to make payments. Market developments offer firms more flexibility in managing their liquidity risk and it is clear that approaches to managing risk in funding structures are evolving.  But firms, their regulators, and central banks increasingly will need to take account of the potential for liquidity problems.  Many have done so in a domestic context, for example, in the United Kingdom, the FSA’s new systems and controls requirements and the Bank’s reform of its operations in the sterling money markets.2 However, while many of the issues identified are international, there is currently no international agreement on requirements.3 There is a clear case for public authorities and market participants to direct more attention to the concept of liquidity management. Tiering in infrastructures The Bank has sought to ensure that the most systemically important UK payment systems satisfy the risk management standards set out in the Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems published by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS).  The UK’s large-value payment systems, CHAPS Sterling and CHAPS Euro, and the embedded payment mechanism in CREST, satisfy the Core Principles relating to the control of credit and liquidity risk.  For example, all three systems enable transactions to be settled intraday over accounts at the Bank of England, so that the settlement asset is risk free.  And they have also been designated under the Financial Markets and Insolvency (Settlement Finality) Regulations, so that these intraday payments enjoy protection against legal challenge under insolvency law. Relative to large-value payment systems in some other developed countries, however, relatively few banks settle directly at the central bank.  In the United Kingdom these banks are sometimes described as ‘first-tier’ or ‘settlement’ members. Other banks form a ‘second tier’ and use one of these settlement members to receive and make payments. A tiered payment structure of this sort can give rise to several types of risk relative to a structure in which all banks are settlement members: ● Credit risk: Credit exposures arise when settlement banks offer their customer banks overdraft facilities when making outward payments on that customer’s behalf.  Conversely, when customer banks hold positive intraday balances at their settlement bank, the customer bank is exposed to the settlement bank. ● Operational and liquidity risk: When payment activity is concentrated in a limited number of settlement banks, an operational disruption affecting one of them could affect a large number of other banks. On the other hand, a non-tiered structure increases dependency on the single central infrastructure. ● Legal risk: In some cases, for example a payment between two second-tier banks settled across accounts at the same CHAPS settlement member, the payment would not enter the large-value payment system and so would not enjoy the additional protection against legal challenge to its finality that is granted in systems designated under the Settlement Finality Regulations. A tiered structure can however offer benefits.  For example, it may not be cost efficient for banks which make small volumes of payments to pay the infrastructure and other costs associated with settlement membership.  These include the indirect Strengthening financial infrastructure – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 77 (1) Large, A, ‘Why we should worry about liquidity’ , Financial Times, 1 1 November 2004.

There may also be some risk management benefits from tiering.  Second-tier banks often rely on uncollateralised intraday credit lines from their settlement banks.  To retain access to these credit lines some second-tier banks might be induced to maintain higher risk management standards than they would otherwise.  More generally, except where the associated risks have clear systemic consequences, it would be wrong for the public authorities to seek to curtail tiering and thereby constrain banks’ commercial provision of payment services. The next two sections focus on the risk implications of tiering in CHAPS Sterling and CREST Sterling.  The final section explores whether similar risks arise in LCH.Clearnet Ltd and the Continuous Linked Settlement System (CLS), two other key infrastructures for UK wholesale financial markets. CHAPS Sterling Twelve1 commercial banks and the Bank of England are settlement members of CHAPS Sterling.  This is small relative to the number of UK-resident banks, making the UK large-value payment system one of the more highly tiered in the G10 countries (Table 1).2 Survey evidence suggests that payments made on behalf of customer banks account for more than half of the £200 billion of payments which are on average settled in CHAPS Sterling each day.  But not all high-value, same-day interbank payments in the United Kingdom go through CHAPS.  When both the payer and the payee have accounts with the same settlement bank, these payments are ‘internalised’ and settled across the books of the settlement bank. Survey data from 2003 collected by the Bank suggest that around 30% of all same-day payments are internalised correspondent payments (Chart 1). The risk exposures that arise between settlement and customer banks depend on the size of credit positions.  Some customer banks are not offered intraday credit by their settlement bank.  Where intraday overdrafts are offered, these are typically subject to credit limits.  Survey data reveal, however, that these exposures of settlement banks to their customer banks can be large, even if they are often short-lived.  The highest recorded intraday peak exposure to a single second-tier customer bank (averaged across the sample period of the survey) was between £3.5 and £4 billion.  And, in general, these overdrafts are unsecured:  the survey revealed few examples of collateralisation. The survey showed that intraday overdraft facilities offered to customer banks were far higher than overnight credit limits.  In stressed situations, however, a settlement bank may find itself unable to avoid an intraday overdraft becoming an overnight exposure.  And, unlike overnight or longer-term credit 78 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – Strengthening financial infrastructure (1) Counting the memberships of National Westminster Bank and The Royal Bank of Scotland separately. (2) In some countries, banks with direct access to large-value payment systems sometimes use other settlement banks rather than their own central bank accounts to make payments.  This means that figures in the table may understate the degree of tiering in routine circumstances.

Comparing the survey evidence on intraday exposures with settlement banks’ capital, it appears that under normal circumstances the exposures to a single second-tier bank are not large enough to threaten the solvency of settlement banks.  In a stressed situation, these exposures may rise considerably however.  In addition to the potential overnight exposure of the settlement banks to the second-tier bank, the second-tier bank could find its ability to continue to make payments highly dependent on the provision of credit from the settlement member.  At the same time, the settlement member might be under pressure to cut rather than extend credit. Concentration of customer bank payments also tends to increase the potential impact of operational disruption at one of the settlement banks.  This operational risk can be offset by investment in information technology infrastructure and contingency arrangements.  Research carried out by the Bank has found that operational problems at individual CHAPS settlement members would not in general prevent the remaining banks from making payments to each other.  Nonetheless, the operational failure of a key node bank would still disrupt all of its own customers and those to whom they were making payments.1 Customer banks can reduce this risk by holding accounts with more than one settlement bank. The Bank’s proposed reforms to its operations in the sterling money markets, announced in summer 2004, may encourage some banks to become settlement members of CHAPS Sterling.2 As part of these reforms, UK banks and building societies will be offered access to reserve accounts at the Bank remunerated at the Bank’s repo rate.  The intention is that these reserves could be available to support intraday payments in CHAPS Sterling and the Bank hopes that, as a consequence, more banks will join as direct settlement members. In parallel, the Bank is analysing the fee structures in CHAPS to assess whether these may pose a potential barrier to new members.  The direct costs of joining CHAPS are not the main costs of direct membership, and are a less significant factor than, for example, the cost of maintaining an appropriate liquidity management team.  But the current CHAPS fee structure falls more heavily on banks with small volumes than those in other countries, including G10 ones (Chart 2).3 Beyond that, it might be worth considering whether further regulatory or prudential policies could be used to strengthen incentives to mitigate the risks associated with payment tiering.  For example, closer monitoring of the intraday exposures which arise on the balance sheets of settlement banks may help improve risk management. CREST Sterling There are two ‘legs’ to each transaction in securities settlement systems:  a payment leg and a securities leg.  There is some degree of tiering in both legs. In the payment leg, tiering in the UK securities settlement system, CREST, is similar to that in CHAPS. Thirteen commercial banks are settlement members of CREST Sterling (including all of the twelve CHAPS Sterling settlement members), settling their own and their CREST customers’ sterling securities transactions across accounts at the Bank.  CREST has over 41,000 other members, however, including 2,000 banks and brokers.  CREST members make and Strengthening financial infrastructure – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 79 (1) James, K (2003), ‘A Statistical Overview of CHAPS Sterling’ , Bank of England Financial Stability Review, June; and Bedford, P , Millard, S and Yang, J (2004), ‘Assessing Operational Risk in CHAPS Sterling:  a Simulation Approach’ , Bank of England Financial Stability Review, June.

Settlement banks often allow their customers to run overdrafts on their accounts when purchasing securities.  The resulting exposures raise similar risk issues to those in CHAPS.  As in CHAPS, some settlement banks use uncollateralised debit caps to control their exposures to other CREST members. But in CREST there is the additional option of collateralising the exposure by taking a charge over the securities purchased.  The Bank intends to study further the scale and nature of these exposures. CREST itself extends no credit to its members – in line with best risk management practices, as described in the Standards for Securities Clearing and Settlement Systems issued recently by the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) (October 2004).1 The ESCB-CESR Standards also address the issue of protection of securities purchased by customers – that is, custody risk.  All CREST members hold securities accounts.  But a subset of less than 300 act as securities custodian for counterparties that are not CREST members.  They represent an inner tier in the securities settlement process.  This degree of tiering in the securities leg is not, however, peculiar to the United Kingdom. Other systems CHAPS and CREST Sterling systems are designed to prevent credit exposures arising between settlement members.  In addition, neither CHAPSCo nor CRESTCo is itself a counterparty to transactions with settlement members.  LCH.Clearnet Ltd (LCH), on the other hand, is a central counterparty to transactions and takes on credit exposures, which are fully margined, to its clearing members.  CLS is a settlement agent rather than a counterparty to foreign exchange transactions, but it can still incur exposures during the settlement process if the positive value of a member’s account is eliminated by exchange rate variations.  These potential exposures of the infrastructure itself to the inner-tier members mean that there are arguments for restricting membership to institutions that meet certain credit quality and liquidity management standards. Trading exposures between LCH and members are managed through the collection of margin, both at the start of the day and, potentially, intraday.  There is some tiering in the provision of clearing services, with clearing members acting on behalf of non-members.  In the case of General Clearing Members (GCMs), the separation in an omnibus client account of segregated client positions from the GCM’s own or ‘house’ positions facilitates the protection of segregated clients in the event of a default by the GCM caused by losses on the house account.  The GCM, however, retains some credit exposure to its customers.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that GCMs manage such exposure in a variety of ways, with strict access criteria and margin calls on customers (often the pass-through of LCH margin calls) the tools most commonly employed.  To the extent that there is a timing mismatch between the customer’s trade and the payment of margin, some daylight exposure may remain. Exposures can also arise as a result of LCH’s payment arrangements.  There are exposures between LCH and the Protected Payment System (PPS) banks (depending on which party is in credit), between the PPS banks and the banks that on behalf of LCH concentrate payments in each of the key currencies (LCH’s concentration banks) and between the PPS banks and other members while margin payments are collected and disbursed.  A project is under way to consider whether the Bank of England could become LCH’s concentration bank in Sterling and Euro, thus eliminating potential exposure to the risk of concentration bank default. The project also considers the introduction of tighter timetables for collection and disbursement of margin payments that could help reduce potential exposures further. CLS had 53 settlement members at end-October 2004, of which around a third were providing third-party services to about 1 80 indirect or third-party users.  Settlement members can be exposed to third-party users, or vice versa, depending on whether currency balances owed are paid before or after currency balances owing.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that, for the largest providers of CLS third-party services, the intraday credit exposures are typically incurred by the settlement members rather than by third-party users.

In November 2004, the central banks of the Group of Ten countries and the Technical Committee of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) published risk-management Recommendations for Central Counterparties, and guidance for assessing central counterparties’ implementation of these recommendations.2 Box 1 also details progress on a number of initiatives intended to strengthen the UK financial infrastructure.

Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) and foreign exchange settlement risk – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 85  86 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) and foreign exchange settlement risk G10 CENTRAL BANKS set out a strategy to reduce foreign exchange settlement risk in the 1 996 Allsopp Report.1 One strand of this strategy was a call for action by private sector industry groups to provide risk-reducing multi-currency settlement services.  The successful launch of CLS in September 2002 has been the banking sector’s main response to that requirement.2 This article explores how far CLS’s market coverage has expanded, and examines which sectors of the market have not so far taken up the risk-reduction benefits offered by CLS.  For sectors and institutions not participating in CLS, central banks and supervisors continue to be interested in the magnitude of settlement exposures and how the consequent risks are being managed.  For those participating in CLS, different risk management issues arise.  The article considers how the liquidity needs of CLS settlement membership are managed through the Inside/Outside swap mechanism – at the cost of reintroducing a limited amount of settlement risk – and reviews how CLS controls the operational risk inherent in a single system linking multiple financial markets. CLS market coverage Chart 1 shows that volumes and values of transactions settled in CLS grew strongly in the first year of its operation and have continued to increase over the past year.  In 2004 Q3, total sides settled averaged US$1.4 trillion – representing turnover of US$0.7 trillion given that each transaction has two sides.  It is not possible to measure precisely CLS’s share of the global market for foreign exchange settlement because up-to-date figures for the market as a whole are not available.  However, the results of the latest BIS Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity indicated that total daily turnover in the foreign exchange market averaged some US$1.9 trillion in April 2004.3 Although the two sets of figures are not directly comparable, the survey results suggest, when taken together with the CLS settlement data, that a substantial share of global foreign exchange transactions is still being settled outside CLS.  Which types of transactions are not settled through CLS and which counterparties remain exposed to foreign exchange settlement risk are questions of interest to central banks and supervisory authorities. Gaps in CLS market penetration Since there are costs as well as benefits for institutions from participating in CLS,4 transferring settlement of foreign exchange business into CLS will not be appropriate for every company trading foreign exchange, particularly for those with a low volume of Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) and foreign exchange settlement risk David Sawyer, Market Infrastructure Division, Bank of England CLS – the international foreign exchange settlement system – was successfully launched in September 2002.  Two years on, the volumes and values of transactions settled in CLS continue to grow.  However, well over half of global foreign exchange settlement still appears to take place outside CLS, especially for transactions involving non-bank financial institutions such as investment funds and hedge funds.  The G10 central banks and banking supervisors have made clear their interest in how banks manage settlement risk in such transactions.  They continue to monitor whether enough has been done to reduce this risk, and to consider what further action might be necessary. (1) Bank for International Settlements, ‘Settlement Risk in Foreign Exchange Transactions’ , March 1 996.  The Report was produced by a Steering Group chaired by Peter Allsopp of the Bank of England. (2) CLS removes the risk of loss of principal in a foreign exchange transaction by ensuring simultaneous, or payment-versus-payment, settlement of both sides of the transaction.  This process and other features of the CLS system are described in more detail in Box 1. (3) Fifty-two central banks and monetary authorities participated in this survey.  They collected data on turnover in traditional foreign exchange markets – spot, outright forwards and foreign exchange swaps – and in over-the-counter (OTC) currency and interest rate derivatives. (4) Settlement members of CLS must purchase a shareholding in CLS Group Holdings, as well as meet the system set-up and operational costs of settling transactions in CLS.  A per-item fee is charged for each transaction settled.  Costs for third-party users are subject to agreement with their settlement member.  business or making transactions of small aggregate value.  However, the BIS Triennial Survey data, together with discussions with current settlement members of CLS,1 suggest that there are institutions with significant volumes and values of business which continue currently to settle outside CLS. Participation by such institutions in CLS, either as members or as third-party users, could reduce risk to these institutions, their counterparties and the system as a whole. Despite the absence of comprehensive statistics on CLS’s share of the individual sectors of the market for foreign exchange settlement, CLS’s own studies indicate three main gaps in its market penetration.  CLS has managed to capture a significant portion of the foreign exchange transactions between the world’s largest banks.  There has, however, been less success, so far, in extending its services to other banks, to non-bank financial institutions and to non-financial companies. Banks The list of members and third-party users in CLS at end-October 2004 gives some insight into use of CLS in the inter-bank foreign exchange market.2 All of the 55 members are commercial or investment banks, while close to 80% of around 1 80 third-party users are also banks.  In the G10 countries, most major banks active in the foreign exchange market are settlement members or third-party users of CLS.3 The BIS Triennial Survey found that 53% of trades were between reporting banks, representing a turnover of around US$900 billion.  Taken with the value of transactions settled in CLS, this suggests that the larger part by value of total inter-bank trades are settled in CLS. As the home authority, the Bank of England has a particular interest in the sterling business settled in CLS.  The average daily value of sterling transactions settled in CLS in April 2004 was equivalent to some US$1 47 billion.  This compared with an average sterling turnover estimated by the BIS at some US$320 billion equivalent.  A raw comparison of figures for the sterling market suggests that a marginally higher share of sterling business is settled in CLS than the share for all currencies combined. Nevertheless, that still leaves well over half of all sterling business settled outside CLS. Four of the major UK-owned clearing banks (Barclays, HSBC, RBS and Standard Chartered) joined CLS as shareholders and became settlement members from the outset.  A few UK-owned banks which are significant, but not among the largest, traders in foreign exchange, are absent from the current list of CLS settlement members and third-party users.  The most significant of these are in the process of becoming third-party users.  Nevertheless, participation in CLS by UK institutions still contrasts with some other countries – for instance Switzerland, where many banks, including some with only a small presence in the foreign exchange market have chosen to participate in CLS, usually as third-party users. Non-bank financial institutions and non-financial corporations The most obvious gaps in CLS’s current coverage are in the area of non-bank financial institutions and non-financial corporations.  This is perhaps not surprising given that regulatory pressure for the reduction of foreign exchange settlement risk was directed in the first instance at banks. There are less than 30 non-bank financial institutions already participating in CLS.

(2) These data are provided and updated regularly by CLS on its website:  www.cls-services.com (3) Most large Canadian banks are not yet participating in CLS, but have indicated that they intend to begin submitting trades for settlement in 2005.  One possible reason why Canadian banks have not so far used CLS is that it does not yet have the capacity to settle same-day value trades in Canadian/US dollars. CLS is investigating the feasibility of introducing additional (later) settlement sessions in which some same-day trades could be settled, including those involving the Canadian dollar.  survey found, however, that foreign exchange trading between reporting banks and their (non-reporting) financial customers had risen markedly since the 2001 Survey, accounting for one third of total turnover in April 2004.  The survey suggested that this may to a large extent reflect a significant increase in activity by hedge funds and commodity trading advisers, as well as the robust growth of trading by investment/fund managers.  Very few such institutions currently participate in CLS. CLS has worked with user groups to enable investment/fund managers to settle foreign exchange deals in CLS via custodian banks that are CLS settlement members or have arrangements with a settlement member.1 In due course, this may help encourage greater participation by such institutions. For funds with a higher risk appetite, for example some hedge funds, the additional costs of using CLS may however exceed the value that they attach to eliminating settlement risk incurred when trading with large banks, making them unlikely future third-party users. The presence of a few major non-financial companies in the list of third-party CLS users indicates that there is a business case for participation in the system by some non-financial firms.  Besides risk-reduction and the potential savings from netting of liquidity requirements, third-party participation can offer scope for savings in processing costs. The number of non-bank institutions participating in CLS as third-party users seems likely to grow over time, although the extent and speed of that growth are not yet clear.  One way for banks to encourage counterparties who remain outside CLS to join would be to use differential pricing, or lower trading limits, for non-CLS participants to reflect the extra risk of dealing with these counterparties.  But for counterparties which remain outside CLS, banks need to employ other ways of managing and containing foreign exchange settlement risk. Managing foreign exchange settlement risk outside CLS Banks, and their supervisors, have an interest in ensuring that they measure, monitor and control foreign exchange settlement risk.  The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published supervisory guidance on principles and methods for reducing foreign exchange settlement risk in September 2000.2 The guidance expects banks to measure foreign exchange settlement exposures accurately and set settlement limits for all counterparties.  Collateral arrangements and legally sound netting arrangements are identified as other possible ways of reducing risk.  The guidance envisages action by supervisors where they determine that a bank’s settlement risk management is not adequate or effective.  It notes that if settlement exposures remain at levels considered by supervisors higher than necessary, tools such as large exposure limits or additional capital requirements could be used. Extending CLS to new currencies Adding new currencies to the CLS settlement process could provide another way of extending CLS’s risk reduction benefits.  Currently, CLS can settle foreign exchange transactions that involve any two of eleven currencies.  Four more currencies are scheduled to start settling by early 2005 (these are listed in Box 1). Figures from the BIS’s 2004 Triennial Survey suggest that trade in the currencies outside these 1 5 currently accounts for only around 5% of total turnover in the global foreign exchange market. Given that there are fixed costs to CLS and its settlement members of introducing new currencies, this may weaken the business case for adding further currencies to CLS.  At the same time, simple comparisons of values and volumes for these currencies with those for currencies already settled in CLS do not give an accurate measure of the relative risk-reduction that could be achieved.  Besides the size of the currency exposure, the probability of non-receipt also needs to be taken into account. Members and prospective users of CLS, as well as central banks and other regulators, may consider that risk-reduction benefits warrant the inclusion in CLS of other currencies. For a currency to be included in CLS, it must meet certain risk-related eligibility criteria.  These include: ● a sufficient number of liquidity providers (their role is described in Box 1) in that currency; 88 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) and foreign exchange settlement risk (1) The work included agreement on an industry standard coding for SWIFT messages to help identify the fund counterparty in a foreign exchange transaction. (2) Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, ‘Supervisory Guidance for Managing Settlement Risk in Foreign Exchange Transactions’, September 2000.  Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) and foreign exchange settlement risk – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 89 CLS is a complex system and it is not possible in this short article to give a full account of its rules.  The following is therefore a summary of its main features. Legal structure, participation and oversight The Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) system is designed to eliminate principal risk on the foreign exchange transactions that it settles.  The service is provided by CLS Bank International (CLS Bank), a US-incorporated special-purpose bank with a sister operations company (CLS Services Ltd) in the United Kingdom.  Its parent company (CLS Group Holdings AG, incorporated in Switzerland) is currently owned by 69 of the world’s largest financial organisations (mainly commercial banks).  CLS Bank operates as a settlement agent for foreign exchange transactions;  it does not become a counterparty to its users’ transactions. Participation in the CLS system can take two main forms, as a member or as a third-party user.1 A settlement member’s foreign exchange transactions are settled directly across its accounts at CLS Bank, while those of a third-party user (which has no direct relationship with CLS Bank) are settled by a settlement member on its behalf. CLS is overseen on a co-operative basis by the central banks which issue the currencies settled in the system, under the leadership of the Federal Reserve.2 The framework for this oversight is that of the Principles for Co-operative Central Bank Oversight of Cross-border and Multicurrency Netting and Settlement Schemes set out in the ‘Lamfalussy Report’ published by the BIS.3 The settlement and funding process CLS currently settles transactions involving eleven ‘eligible’ currencies.  These are the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Danish krone, euro, Japanese yen, Norwegian krone, Singapore dollar, sterling, Swedish krona, Swiss franc and US dollar.  Four more currencies – the Hong Kong dollar, the Korean won, the New Zealand dollar and the South African rand – are due to be admitted by early 2005. CLS Bank uses the large-value payment systems of the currencies that it settles to make and receive payments to and from members, so CLS’s daily settlement process takes place over a short (five hour) period during which these systems are concurrently open (although not all are open for the full five hours).  In Central European Time (CET), this is 07 .00 to 12.00 (one hour earlier in UK time). Each settlement member holds a multi-currency account at CLS Bank, with balances in each currency (these balances are normally zero at the start and end of the settlement day).  Settlement of a foreign exchange transaction is effected on a gross basis by simultaneous credits and debits across the accounts of the two parties to the transaction in the relevant currencies, subject to the risk management controls outlined below being met.  This ensures that principal risk is eliminated for each transaction. However, there is a clear distinction between settlement and the funding process.  To ensure an efficient use of liquidity, members have to fund only their net short currency positions for the day, and CLS Bank pays out to members the amounts corresponding to their net long currency positions. Furthermore, the system minimises the liquidity impact on members and local payment systems of the funding requirements by allowing each settlement member to spread its funding over several instalments (‘pay-ins’), subject to a minimum schedule issued at the start of each day to each member for each currency.  Net long currency positions are also paid out to members in instalments (‘pay-outs’) as long balances in the appropriate currencies become available.  There is no schedule set at the beginning of the day for a member’s pay-outs since it is not possible to forecast the exact time at which members will make their pay-ins. Box 1:  Main features of the CLS System (1) There are two forms of membership:  settlement membership and user membership.  The transactions of a user member, like those of a third-party user, are settled across a settlement member’s account.  Unlike those of a third-party user, they are submitted directly to CLS Bank.  Currently, there is one user member of CLS. (2) The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is also the supervisor of CLS Bank. (3) Bank for International Settlements, ‘Report of the Committee on Interbank Netting Schemes of the Central Banks of the Group of Ten Countries’ , November 1 999.  90 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) and foreign exchange settlement risk Risk controls Transactions submitted by members are queued at the beginning of the day.  The settlement of each transaction proceeds in turn from 07 .00 CET as long as certain risk controls are satisfied once the transaction is settled.  These are: 1. Members can run debit balances in individual currencies but these cannot exceed given limits. These are called Short Position Limits, or SPLs – although a better name might be short balance limits.  The SPL for a given currency is the same for all members, and is a function of the liquidity available in that currency from liquidity providers to CLS Bank (the role of liquidity providers is explained below). 2. The aggregate of each member’s short balances across all currencies cannot exceed a specified limit – the Aggregate Short Position Limit, or ASPL – for that member.  This is calculated as a function of, amongst other criteria, the member’s credit rating. 3. Each member must retain net positive value overall on its account across all currencies at all times during the settlement process.  This ensures that short balances in currencies are collateralised by long balances during the settlement process, and that CLS Bank (and by implication other members) is not extending credit to the member on its account.  Haircuts are applied to a member’s currency balances to help protect the account’s overall positive value against exchange rate variations. Failure management: liquidity providers CLS has a range of additional measures to limit the impact of a payment default by a member on other members.  Liquidity providers are banks that commit to provide liquidity in a given currency to CLS Bank to enable it to make timely pay-outs to members in these currencies in certain scenarios in which other members fail to meet their pay-in requirements.  Such a scenario could occur, for example, if a member fails to meet one of its scheduled pay-ins for a currency after all transactions have settled across members’ accounts at CLS Bank,1 leaving the member with a short balance in that currency on its account.  CLS Bank could then be left with a liquidity shortfall in that currency, preventing it from completing the pay-outs to other members.  The liquidity provision mechanism involves CLS Bank selling some of the positive balances that the non-paying member retained on its account in other currencies to a liquidity provider in exchange for the required amount of the currency expected from the non-payer. The transaction initially takes the form of an overnight foreign exchange swap, so it is reversed the following day, on the assumption that the problem experienced by the non-paying member is temporary and the non-payer will by then have funded its currency shortfall.  If, however, the member’s problem proves to be more serious and it continues to fail to pay in the missing amount, CLS Bank will eventually convert the foreign exchange swap with the liquidity provider into an outright purchase of the currency. The commitments available from liquidity providers in a given currency are sufficient to ensure that, even in the event of the failure of the liquidity provider with the largest commitment to meet its obligation, the other liquidity providers’ commitments will be enough to cover the short balance of the non-paying member. Loss sharing arrangements Despite the extensive facilities from liquidity providers (which have, at the time of writing, not been used by CLS since the start of its operations), exceptional circumstances could still lead CLS Bank to record a loss.  This would be the case if, for example, exchange rate variations were sufficient to exceed the volatility haircuts on the balances on the failing member’s account and cause its overall value to become negative.  CLS Bank would then have insufficient positive balances to fund the swap transactions with liquidity providers.  In this case, CLS would allocate these losses to the surviving members according to a loss allocation scheme.  There are several stages to this, including an initial pro rata allocation of losses to members who had dealt with the failing member and then a further allocation to all surviving members if the first allocation raised insufficient funds. (1) Settlement is normally completed, with finality, by 09.00 CET.  ● satisfaction that the currency’s relevant large-value payment system meets CLS Bank’s operational requirements, including that it provides Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) or equivalent; ● adequate access to liquidity in that currency; ● acceptability to CLS Bank of any restrictions or conditions on the transferability of the currency; ● acceptability to CLS Bank of any restrictions on convertibility; ● an assessment satisfying CLS Bank that volatility in the currency can be managed with practicable haircuts; ● receipt of a satisfactory legal opinion on the finality of settlement instructions between members and the finality of payments made to and received by CLS Bank in the subject currency. These criteria are designed to ensure that the inclusion of currencies achieves the intended settlement risk reduction benefits without introducing risks of disruption to CLS users, or to other currency areas and their payment systems connected to each other via CLS. To accommodate a wider range of currencies without unacceptable additional risk of disruption to the settlement process, CLS has worked with its members, liquidity providers and central banks over the past two years to develop a revised Framework for Eligible Currencies.  The framework complements the currency eligibility criteria by providing a clear articulation of the CLS system’s risk design components for existing and new currencies.  It includes provisions to mitigate the potential credit and currency risks faced by liquidity providers.1 These include, for example, the possibility of assigning a Short Position Limit (Box 1) of zero to a ‘deteriorating’ currency (one for which the relevant sovereign credit rating has fallen below the equivalent of BBB), so that an instruction involving that currency can settle only on a cash basis. Like the eligibility criteria, the revised framework seeks to ensure that any new currencies do not increase the operational, liquidity, legal, market or credit risks to CLS settlement members, liquidity providers and other stakeholders beyond acceptable levels.  The framework thus makes it possible for a wide range of currencies to be considered for inclusion in the CLS system. The new risk-management challenges of continuous linked settlement Principal risk has been eliminated in the foreign exchange transactions settled through CLS.  But successful settlement requires management of some other risks by settlement members and by CLS itself. Meeting potentially large timed pay-in requirements depends on reliable liquidity management.  The settlement process also involves new operational interdependencies – with operational failures potentially having a wide cross-border impact.  The success of CLS therefore also depends on robust operational risk management. Liquidity management and the Inside/Outside swap mechanism CLS reduces the size of members’ liquidity needs by requiring them to pay to CLS Bank amounts corresponding to only their net short currency positions.  However, as Box 1 explains, CLS also requires members to make their pay-ins according to a minimum schedule.  Members therefore still need to ensure that they have sufficient liquidity in place to meet this minimum schedule.  Inside/Outside (I/O) swaps are a mechanism that allows settlement members to trade down their short net currency positions in CLS Bank through bilateral trades in an effort to ease the time-specific liquidity pressures generated by their CLS pay-in requirements.  The swap consists of an ‘in’ leg settled in CLS, in which the two members buy some or all of their respective short currencies and sell some or all of their respective long currencies, and an ‘out’ leg for the same amounts and currencies in the opposite direction settled outside CLS where time pressures for settlement and liquidity are less intense. A certain amount of principal risk is reintroduced by the I/O swap mechanism since one leg of each swap must be settled outside CLS.  Members expected the mechanism to form an essential tool for alleviating the liquidity pressures caused by possible large imbalances between their ‘inside’ and ‘outside’ CLS positions.  It was thought, however, that as the Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) and foreign exchange settlement risk – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 91 (1) Box 1 describes the CLS settlement process and the role of liquidity providers.  number of users of the system grew these imbalances would diminish and members’ ‘in’ positions would gradually resemble their overall foreign exchange market positions, reducing the need for the I/O swap mechanism.  Chart 2 shows that the value of I/O swaps as a percentage of the total values settled in CLS did indeed fall sharply in the first few months of CLS’s operations, reflecting increases in the system’s netting efficiency as settled values grew. However, the share has since stabilised at around 6% and the average absolute value of I/O swaps has in fact increased slightly. Given that CLS aimed to eliminate principal risk, central banks have needed to consider whether it is appropriate that CLS incorporates a mechanism that re-introduces a proportion of principal risk into foreign exchange market positions.  The Bank’s meetings with UK members of CLS indicate that they see the reintroduction of a small proportion of foreign exchange principal risk as an acceptable cost of reducing the liquidity risk that could otherwise result from having to make large pay-ins by tight deadlines.  Like many payment and clearing systems designed to reduce credit risk, CLS can make new demands on liquidity management.  There is a trade-off between reducing credit risk and minimising liquidity risk.  For the time being, the extent of the trade-off in CLS seems in the Bank’s view to be acceptable.  However, the role and impact of the I/O swaps mechanism will be kept under review as the values settled by the system increase.1 Operational risk Operational risk is widely recognised as an important and growing risk within the financial system, and one that can be particularly concentrated in payment and settlement systems.  Given the potential cross-border impact via CLS of an operational failure, appropriate management of operational risk in CLS is given a high priority by regulatory authorities and CLS itself.  The central banks that co-operatively oversee CLS (Box 1) have therefore worked closely with CLS and its settlement members to ensure that the system maintains a high level of resilience. CLS’s infrastructure is designed to provide for a high availability of service.  CLS has processes to mitigate the risk from key dependencies on both its own systems as well as on various external parties, including SWIFT, the RTGS systems through which it receives and makes its currency payments, settlement members and their nostro agents, and its liquidity providers.  The unavailability of CLS’s own operations centre or primary processing system can be recovered from quickly.  CLS has also agreed a set of contingency arrangements with each RTGS system provider to cope with an RTGS outage or with the loss of links to an RTGS system, and settlement members have to satisfy high operational requirements set by CLS.  Contingency arrangements are regularly reviewed and tested with all members. Conclusion CLS is still evolving, recruiting new users and introducing new currencies.  This increased use of CLS will contribute further to the reduction of foreign exchange settlement risk.  But large parts of the foreign exchange market are not yet settling through CLS and it is not clear that CLS will reach all these parts.  The central banks that oversee CLS continue to monitor the success of the overall G10 strategy and to assess what further action might be necessary to ensure its success.  One option may be to review whether there is a need for greater use of the supervisory tools identified in the Basel Committee guidance. 92 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) and foreign exchange settlement risk 0 200 400 600 800 1,000 1,200 1,400 1,600 1,800 Sep.

(a) The chart compares the value of Inside/Outside swaps with the values of sides settled in CLS.  It also shows the percentage of principal risk reintroduced outside the system by the Inside/Outside swap mechanism. (1) CLS itself is endeavouring to find ways to reduce the extent to which settlement risk is reintroduced by I/O swaps.  This includes investigating the feasibility of introducing additional (later) CLS settlement sessions, in which some of the current out legs of I/O swaps could be settled, thus eliminating the principal risk currently reintroduced by these legs.  Securities settlement systems:  assessing their relative riskiness – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 93 SECURITIES SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS1 (SSSs) provide a means of transferring the ownership of securities. This occurs through three, normally linked,2 steps: (a) the securities are delivered to the buyer, usually through entries on the SSSs’ books;  (b) the funds are paid to the seller, on the books of either the central bank or a commercial bank;  and (c) the legal record of ownership is updated. Settlement is an essential part of the post-trade process and as such its resilience is fundamental to the efficient functioning of financial markets.  But institutions using SSSs face a number of risks, or potential ‘settlement shocks’ .  Broadly speaking, settlement shocks can be mitigated in two ways: either ex ante by decreasing the likelihood of the risk crystallising, or ex post by reducing the impact of the risk once it has occurred.  Table 1 summarises the risk mitigants relevant for each type of shock. For example, participants in settlement systems could encounter operational risks, which might cause delays and affect market liquidity.  An ex ante approach to mitigating operational risk is to ensure that systems and controls meet minimum requirements.  The impact of operational risks can be reduced by ensuring that there are effective ex post contingency plans to continue a system’s operations at alternative sites. There is also financial risk, or the possibility of insolvency of the SSS.  This arises if the SSS takes credit risks, either by acting as principal in lending or implicitly through the operation of a net settlement process.3 Other financial shocks could be caused by a severe loss of revenue or a significant increase in costs. The likelihood of financial failure can be reduced by ensuring the system has an adequate capital base and by adopting credit risk controls.  Procedures to replace a failed system rapidly with a safe and efficient substitute are an example of an ex post mitigant. There are several other types of risk which affect members of SSSs.  Participants using a commercial bank to finalise payment obligations face settlement bank risk, or the possibility of a failure of that bank.  This risk can be mitigated ex ante by using central bank accounts to settle the cash leg of a securities transaction. Members of an SSS also face principal risk:  the risk that DvP arrangements are inadequate and assets are delivered to a defaulting counterparty before receipt of payment (or vice versa).  Replacement cost risk is the risk that securities are not delivered by the seller on the due date and the buyer has to replace the transaction at the current market price.  Shortening the length of the settlement cycle, the time between the execution of a trade and its settlement, reduces the time in which a counterparty default or delivery failure could take place.4 (1) For the purposes of this article, a SSS is defined as the central securities depository or international central securities depository in each country. (2) Linking these steps ensures ‘delivery versus payment’ (DvP) – the principle whereby final delivery of securities occurs if and only if payment of funds also occurs. (3) In net settlement systems, credit can effectively be provided by the SSS as agent for other participants in the system.  In the event of a failure of a participant with a net debit position, the remaining participants could face a shortfall in funds or securities. (4) Although shortening the settlement cycle has ex ante benefits for a counterparty default, it is possible that it could lead to an increase in the likelihood of an operational shock if there are delays and inefficiencies in processing trade information. Securities settlement systems: assessing their relative riskiness Will Kerry, Market Infrastructure Division, Bank of England Securities settlement systems are a fundamental piece of the financial infrastructure of an economy. The Bank therefore has an interest in ensuring that adequate risk mitigation techniques are employed by the securities settlement systems most used by UK market participants. In this article, we identify these systems and propose a framework for assessing the quality of their risk controls.  Settlement also entails important legal risks:  losses can arise if the legal framework is incompatible with the practices in an SSS or its implications are uncertain. This article does not consider legal issues further as the associated risks are not readily quantifiable. The settlement shocks in Table 1 could have the potential to disrupt financial markets and the wider economy, particularly if the shock was prolonged.  For example, central banks use SSSs to take delivery of collateral used by banks to obtain intraday liquidity in payment systems and in market operations to implement monetary policy.1 The UK financial system is exposed to systems in other countries.  First, UK market participants trading in foreign securities use the relevant system(s) in that country.  They access the foreign SSS either directly by becoming a remote member, or indirectly – through a custodian, international central securities depository, or via links with the UK SSS – CREST. Second, the increasing consolidation and interoperability in the securities market infrastructure mean that problems in foreign systems can affect the UK SSS.2 Third, disruption in foreign securities markets could affect UK payment systems, as UK banks can obtain intraday credit based on collateral held in both CREST and foreign SSSs.  The Bank accepts foreign collateral for its intraday credit operations, either through the accounts with the international central securities depositories or via the Correspondent Central Banking Model.3 For a comprehensive assessment of the settlement process, all of the arrangements used to settle securities across borders, such as custodians and links between SSSs, should be considered.  Furthermore, the final impact of any settlement shock might include disruption to the wider economy if the shock causes a SSS member to default on commitments with its counterparties.  But, as a first step, this article focuses only on the initial impact of shocks in SSSs on UK market participants, ignoring other entities involved in the process and these potential second- round effects on the financial markets. Method The framework outlined here analyses a country’s SSSs according to ‘SSS relative riskiness’ (SRR), an estimate of the impact of disruption in SSSs on UK markets. SRR is defined as the product of the impact and probability of a settlement shock, and can be proxied 94 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – Securities settlement systems:  assessing their relative riskiness (1) The implications for monetary policy are not discussed further. (2) An example of consolidation is the merger of CRESTCo and the Euroclear group in September 2002.  Interoperability can be achieved by the use of links between SSSs in different countries. (3) The Correspondent Central Banking Model is a mechanism whereby securities held in a SSS in one country can be used to collateralise intraday credit in another country.  European Central Bank (2003) provides more information.

(a) The risk mitigants in this table are similar to the recommendations published by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the Technical Committee of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) in 2001.  A working group of the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) and the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) recently developed EU standards from these recommendations.  The figures in brackets are the numbers of the relevant recommendations in CPSS and IOSCO (2001) and the standards in ESCB and CESR (2004). (b) Counterparty default and replacement cost risk can also be mitigated by the use of a central counterparty (CPSS and IOSCO recommendation 4).  In a few cases, the SSS also acts as a central counterparty. (c) The timing at which a transaction is finally settled affects the impact of a counterparty default or the replacement cost.  System participants that know the effect of the default early in the day will be able to resolve any problems more quickly than participants with information late in the day.  by the product of ‘exposure at settlement shock’ (EAS) and a ‘settlement system rating’ (SSR): SRRi = EASi × SSRi where i denotes each of the countries assessed (around 90 in total). EAS is an estimate of the UK financial system’s exposure to a system;  it is assumed that the impact of a shock is proportional to this exposure.  SSR is an overall assessment of the quality of the ex post and ex ante risk mitigants used in a SSS, and thus is related to the probability and impact of a settlement shock. This method is similar to that devised by Buckle, Cunningham and Davis (2000), which ranked countries according to ‘expected default loss’ , the product of the size of credit exposures of UK lenders to borrowers in each country and the credit risk attached to them.  But in that study ‘expected default loss’ was derived from the market assessments of default risk embodied in credit ratings and credit spreads. ‘Exposure at settlement shock’ Investors are more exposed to settlement shocks the greater the volume of securities that they settle, so it would be desirable to measure the UK financial system’s exposures using the volume of UK market participants’ securities settlement in each SSS around the world.  However, this information is not publicly available.  The approach taken here is to proxy exposures using the Co-ordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).1 The CPIS includes statistics on the level of the UK’s foreign portfolio investment (equities, debt and money market instruments) by country. There are three main caveats to consider when interpreting these data.  First, as country data on flows are not published, figures on the volume of securities settled are estimated using data on the level of securities owned.  This implicitly assumes that investors with larger holdings settle securities more frequently.  However, this may not necessarily be the case.  For example, pension funds and unit trusts hold large stocks of securities, but probably need to settle these securities less frequently than banks and securities firms, which tend to trade more often. Calculating the change in the level of exposure over a given period would not measure the relevant settlement activity either.  The change in the net value of purchases and sales made is not the same as the total gross value of securities settled, and would include any revaluations following changes in asset prices. Second, the CPIS allocates data to countries according to the location of the issuer, rather than the system in which the securities are settled.  This means that UK investment in bonds issued by a French company, but settled in the international central securities depositories, Euroclear Bank or Clearstream Banking Luxembourg, is allocated to France, not Belgium or Luxembourg.  The UK exposures to Belgium and Luxembourg are likely to be significantly under-estimated by the CPIS data. Third, the CPIS excludes direct investments, defined as a holding of 10% or more of the ordinary shares or voting power of an enterprise.  This means that merger and acquisition activity is not included. Exposures to the UK SSS are estimated using data on the UK economy’s domestic portfolio investment. These statistics are published by the Office for National Statistics each quarter. The resulting data are heavily concentrated (Chart 1). Over half of the total exposures of the economy to settlement systems are with the UK SSS.  Almost one-third of total exposures are with other developed countries in Europe;  approximately 1 5% of exposures are with non-European developed countries and offshore centres;  and only around 3% of exposures are with developing countries.2 Settlement system ratings How are the ex ante and ex post risk mitigants used to reduce the probability and impact of various settlement shocks to be addressed? Again, precise data are not available.  But one way of quantifying Securities settlement systems:  assessing their relative riskiness – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 95 (1) IMF (2002) explains this survey in more detail.  Only end-year data are published in the CPIS.  Quarterly estimates can be produced by extrapolating forward from the latest annual data using the growth rates implied by the data on UK banks’ consolidated external portfolio investment claims.  These quarterly estimates are grossed to the UK’s total foreign portfolio investment, published by the Office for National Statistics. (2) Although these results are calculated for the end of 2004 Q2, they would not change significantly if different dates were chosen.  them is to use the ‘Risk Exposure Assessments’ (REAs) produced by Thomas Murray as part of the Capital Market Infrastructure Risk Ratings service. The REAs assess the risk exposures of market participants using the SSSs in different countries. The REAs consider six types of risk and their mitigants, which are similar to those identified in Table 1: ● Operational risk includes the impact of an operational error and a system’s ability to resume processing following disruption.  The factors assessed are equivalent to the mitigants used to counter operational shocks. ● Financial risk contains an assessment of whether a SSS’s capital and financial resources are sufficient. Capital is a risk mitigant for financial failure shocks. ● Counterparty risk includes an evaluation of the DvP procedures used by the system, a mitigant for counterparty default shocks. ● The process and timing of final securities and funds settlement and the length of the settlement cycle are used to determine asset commitment risk. These items are comparable to the risk mitigants for settlement bank, counterparty default and replacement cost shocks. ● Liquidity risk comprises an assessment of a failure to deliver securities or cash on time.  The factors considered are similar to the risk mitigants for replacement cost shocks. ● Finally, a consideration of the risk of losses associated with the processing of corporate actions (eg the handling of dividends) determines asset servicing risk. The system rating is calculated as a weighted average of the first five REAs outlined above.1 The full Capital Market Infrastructure Risk Ratings were not used, for two reasons.  First, asset servicing risk is excluded, as the handling of corporate actions is not part of the settlement process.  Second, certain shocks have a greater impact on financial markets than others.  The weights used in the calculation are selected to reflect the relative potential importance of these settlement shocks to the financial system.  The highest weighting is given to operational and financial risk (as these affect all system participants), followed by asset commitment and counterparty risk (as these only affect some system participants – for example, those trading with a defaulting participant or those using a failing bank for settlement of funds) and liquidity risk (this only affects the participant expecting the delivery of assets).2 The settlement system rating is defined as: where rj and wj are the REAs and their weights, respectively, j denotes each of the settlement shocks and i is the country being assessed. The ratings are presented using the scale developed by Thomas Murray (Table 2).3 A lower risk exposure assessment implies that there are higher quality risk mitigants in that system.

(a) Data are for the end of 2004 Q2. (b) Country groups are those defined by the BIS. (1) The Bank has not independently verified these assessments. (2) A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the precise value of these weights.  The overall ranking was not significantly affected when the weights were changed. (3) The REAs are published using the alphabetic ratings scale (Table 2).  These ratings are converted to a numeric scale to calculate SSR.  However, the alphabetic ratings scale is still used for presentation.  The system ratings are less skewed than the exposure data, with just under a quarter of the systems studied receiving a rating of ‘AA-’ (very good risk mitigants) or above (Chart 2).  Most of these SSSs were located in developed countries.  The majority of systems (54%) have an ‘A’ rating (good risk mitigants).  Around one-fifth of systems were rated ‘BBB’ (acceptable risk mitigants) to ‘B’ (rather poor risk mitigants).  Virtually all of these systems were located in developing countries (the only exception was a system in one of the offshore financial centres).  No systems have a rating of ‘CCC’ (poor risk mitigants) or below. Results Chart 3 considers exposures to SSSs (EAS) and the rating (SSR) of systems together.  The systems most used by UK market participants have either ‘very good’ or ‘good’ risk mitigants (right-lower quadrant). Furthermore, the systems with ratings below BBB (‘acceptable risk mitigants’) are not used significantly. The ordering implied by the SRR statistics is driven by the relative importance of the UK’s exposures to the systems rather than the quality of risk mitigants. Unsurprisingly, the domestic SSS (CREST) is clearly the most important system in terms of UK impact (Table 3);  on the SRR metric, it is around six times more important than the system ranked second. Following this, there are three groups of systems, ranked similarly, that are more significant for UK markets than the other SSSs studied.  The first group comprises the SSSs in the United States and Germany;  the second, the systems in the Netherlands, France, Italy and Belgium;  and the third, the SSSs in Switzerland, Luxembourg and Japan.

Belgium and Luxembourg should probably have a higher ranking, as exposures to the international central securities depositories are likely to be greater than estimated by the method of this article.1 The remaining SSSs are less important;  just over half of the systems studied have a ranking statistic below 0.1 (ie these SSSs are estimated to be approximately one thousand times less important than the domestic system). These results are unlikely to change significantly over time, unless there is an important change in a SSS’s procedures (eg major alterations to processing systems or a change in the DvP mechanism) or a substantial reallocation of portfolios to different countries.  For example, a decision by UK market participants to increase considerably the amount of trading in developing countries’ securities would raise their exposures to settlement systems with lower ratings. Conclusions This article has presented a framework for identifying which SSSs are most important for UK markets.  It finds that the domestic settlement infrastructure is much more important than foreign systems.  This explains why the Bank concentrates on developments in UK market infrastructure, for example, in Strengthening financial infrastructure in the Bank’s Financial Stability Review. This analysis also suggests, however, that SSSs in around ten foreign countries are important for UK markets.  The Bank, therefore, has an ongoing interest in ensuring that adequate minimum requirements for mitigating risks continue to be met by foreign SSSs. This has been achieved to date through the implementation of recommendations such as CPSS and IOSCO (2001) and G30 (2003).  The standards in ESCB and CESR (2004) are intended to be used for the regulation and oversight of EU systems in the near future.  The Bank will be participating in the work to implement these standards. It is possible that, in the near future, minimum risks standards for SSSs could be placed on a statutory basis.  The EU Commission (2004) recently stated that ‘high-level principles for the authorisation, regulation and supervision of securities clearing and settlement systems’ should be included in a directive.  If a directive is drafted, the Bank will work to ensure that any such requirements are set at an appropriate level, given the potential settlement risk both domestic and foreign systems pose to UK financial stability. 98 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – Securities settlement systems:  assessing their relative riskiness (1) As explained in the third page of this article, the CPIS data are based on the country of issuer, not the country of settlement.

Collateral posting decisions in CHAPS Sterling – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 99 BANKS wishing to make real-time sterling payments either on their own behalf, or on behalf of their customers, use the CHAPS Sterling payment system.1 The total value of payments settled is very large, with CHAPS Sterling handling on average approximately £200 billion of payments every day (Chart 1). CHAPS Sterling is used to make various types of payments.  For example, a consumer may use it to buy a house, or a bank may use it to repay an overnight interbank loan.  A disruption to the smooth functioning of CHAPS Sterling would affect the ability to make timely payments, which in turn might lead to the disruption of economic activity that depends upon timely payments being made (such as the interbank loan market). The possible consequences of such a disruption have led researchers at the Bank of England to examine the resilience of CHAPS Sterling to events that temporarily prevent a member bank from making payments.2 These studies have found that CHAPS Sterling is highly robust to such disruption.  This robustness arises in large part because CHAPS Sterling member banks individually post more collateral with the Bank of England than they generally need to support their payment activities. While the fact that member banks behave in this manner is undoubtedly good for system robustness, why they behave in this way demands explanation.  In this article we explore why CHAPS Sterling member banks choose to post the amount of collateral they do. The role of collateral in CHAPS Sterling CHAPS Sterling is a Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) payment system.  In the CHAPS Sterling system, a given member bank A can make a payment of £x to another member bank B only if its available cash at the time at least equals £x.  If a member bank can make the payment, it is made immediately – the The smooth functioning of payment systems, and in particular large-value payment systems, is important to maintaining financial stability.  In the UK, the CHAPS Sterling system allows banks to make real-time sterling payments on their own behalf or on behalf of their customers.  CHAPS Sterling member banks support their payments activity in CHAPS Sterling by borrowing intraday from the Bank of England.  A member bank can borrow from the Bank of England if it posts collateral.  But member banks post much more collateral than they appear to need to support their payment activity.  As a result, CHAPS Sterling should be robust to operational incidents that temporarily prevent a member bank from making payments.  A possible explanation for member banks posting more collateral than they need is that the costs of posting collateral are less than the cost of failing to make timely payments.  The empirical evidence is consistent with this explanation. (1) Although there are only twelve banking groups that are direct members of CHAPS Sterling, all UK resident banks (and so their customers) have access to CHAPS Sterling through (direct or indirect) correspondent relationships with member banks.  Payments between CHAPS Sterling member banks and banks that are not direct members, and payments between banks that are not direct members but have a correspondent relationship with the same member, are settled across the accounts of CHAPS Sterling members rather than in the CHAPS Sterling system itself.

Each payment instruction is settled sequentially and in gross terms (ie payments from A to B and from B to A made at the same time are not netted against one another). A member bank’s available cash at a given time T equals the sum of the value of (eligible) securities it has repoed to the Bank of England before T and net payments the member bank has received by T.  As a shorthand, we use the term ‘posting collateral’ to describe the process by which a member bank puts cash into its CHAPS Sterling account by repoing securities to the Bank of England.1 To illustrate:  if at T a member bank has £100 of collateral posted, and if in the period between the start of the day and T it has made payments of £50 and has received payments of £7 5, then its available cash at T equals £100 + (£7 5 – £50) = £125.  It follows that at T, the member bank could make payments with a value up to £125.  If it did so, it could not make any further payments until either it posted further collateral with the Bank of England or it received a payment from another member bank. As a member bank’s available cash is the sum of the collateral it posts and the net payments it receives, a member bank can use incoming payments to provide the cash it needs to make its payments.  A member bank need only draw upon the cash it obtained by posting collateral to make payments at a given time if the value of payments it has made up to then is more than the value of payments it has received. The difference between the value of payments received and the value of payments made is equal to the member bank’s settlement account balance at the Bank of England.  So, the amount of collateral a bank must post to enable it to make its payments on a given day will equal the maximum overdraft on its settlement account during that day.  When we say that banks post more collateral than they use, we mean that the amount of collateral that a bank posts exceeds the maximum overdraft on its settlement account. To illustrate:  consider the following pattern of incoming and outgoing payments.  At T1, the bank receives a payment of £50 and does not make any payments of its own.  At T2, the bank makes a payment of £25 leaving it with £25 in its settlement account.  At T3, the bank receives another £100 payment leaving it with £125 in its settlement account.  At T4, the bank wishes to make a payment of £200.  Making it will result in an overdraft on the bank’s settlement account of £7 5.  For this payment to go through, the bank must have posted at least £7 5 of collateral before T4;  if not, it would have lacked the amount of cash it needed to make the T4 payment. As payment activity redistributes cash across member banks, it is at least possible for a significant proportion of total system cash to end up at a single member bank at some point in time.  During normal times, interbank payment flows tend roughly to balance out, so if net payment flows to bank A had been high prior to time t, then net payment flows from A would tend to be high after time t.  However, if A were to suffer an operational problem that prevented it from making payments at a time when it had absorbed a significant proportion of total system cash, this redistribution could not occur through this normal payment activity.  Without additional postings of collateral, the remaining member banks would have to support their payment activities with the (smaller) amount of cash they had in their accounts.  If the amount of cash remaining in the accounts of the functioning banks were too small, the flow of payments may be disrupted.  For example, consider the extreme case in which a single bank has received payments from the remaining banks that equal all of their available cash and then suffers from an event that prevents it from making payments.  In this case no other member bank could make a payment until the problem bank made a payment, or until the other member banks posted additional collateral. The probability that a member bank finds itself with insufficient cash to enable it to make its payments decreases as the amount of collateral it posts increases.  In the limit, if a bank were to post collateral equal to the total value of payments it wished to make, then it would have the available cash needed to make all those payments, even if no other 100 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – Collateral posting decisions in CHAPS Sterling (1) To post collateral, a CHAPS Sterling member bank will repo eligible securities to the Bank of England, and the Bank of England will in turn credit the bank’s account with an amount equal to the value of the repoed securities (minus a haircut).  The repoed securities serve as collateral for the account deposit, ensuring that payments made are backed by good funds.  The repo is unwound at the end of the day, and the Bank of England acts as the custodian for the securities overnight.  The process can then be repeated the next day.  bank sent a payment to it.  If a member bank posts more collateral than it needs given normal conditions, it will have a cushion of available cash that it can use in the case of an operational event that temporarily reduces the flow of incoming payments from other member banks. For example, to return to the illustrative case above, suppose that an operational disruption prevented the bank from receiving the £100 payment in T3.  In this case the maximum overdraft on its settlement account, if it made all its payments, would be £17 5.  If the bank had posted collateral just equal to the £7 5 it needed in normal times (no operational disruption), it would not have been able to make its T4 payment unless it posted additional collateral.  However, if the bank had initially posted enough collateral over and above what it needed in normal circumstances (say £200), then the operational disruption that prevented the T3 payment from arriving would not hinder the bank’s ability to make its T4 payment. Banks in CHAPS Sterling generally post more collateral than they use.  Chart 2 shows the ratio of the maximum level of collateral used to the maximum level of collateral posted during the day for the average CHAPS Sterling member bank.  This ratio averages about 0.6.1 That is:  on average, banks use only 60% of the collateral they post.2 Chart 3 shows overall collateral usage in CHAPS Sterling by plotting total collateral for all member banks and total collateral used for the system as a whole.  Again, total collateral posted exceeds total collateral used.3 Charts 2 and 3 suggest that CHAPS Sterling could continue to function smoothly even in the face of an operational event that temporarily deprived banks not directly affected of incoming payments.  Bedford, Millard, and Yang (2004) investigated this hypothesis by using simulations based on CHAPS Sterling payment flows.  In particular, they explored the extent to which an operational event preventing the member bank with the largest net payment inflow from making payments would disrupt the ability of the remaining member banks to make payments.  They found that functioning banks still had the cash available to make all the payments they had in fact made. CHAPS Sterling member banks benefit collectively from the resilience that high collateral postings create.  However, it is harder to see why any individual bank finds it worthwhile to post the collateral needed to ensure this system-wide resilience.  First, the probability of such an event occurring is small.  Second, much of the cost of any disruption may be borne by banks’ customers rather Collateral posting decisions in CHAPS Sterling – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 101 (1) There are complications in measuring collateral posted and used in CHAPS Sterling because CHAPS Sterling also serves as a gateway to the CREST securities settlement system.  Banks use CHAPS Sterling to transfer cash they use to support securities settlement in CREST.  As this cash is only temporarily held in CHAPS Sterling it does not make sense to include these transfers when calculating the amount of collateral posted and used in CHAPS Sterling.  We therefore measure collateral posted in CHAPS Sterling as total collateral posted minus the transfers to CREST.  We also adjust collateral used in CHAPS Sterling to take account of transfers to CREST.  It is also possible to simplify the measurement of collateral posted because banks do not normally vary significantly the amount of the collateral posted during the day.  We take as our measure of collateral posted the amount of collateral posted at 7 am (after the CREST transfers) which is before most CHAPS Sterling payments are made. (2) The ratio between the maximum level of collateral used and the maximum level of collateral posted varies across banks and over time.  However, in our sample, only one CHAPS member consistently uses nearly all of its posted collateral.  For most member banks, the ratio rarely exceeds 90%. (3) The ratio of collateral used to collateral posted for the system as a whole is lower than the average of collateral used to collateral posted for individual banks because banks do not all hit their point of maximum collateral usage at the same time. 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 Aug.

And third, each bank individually would tend to prefer that other banks post the extra collateral needed to keep the system functioning, if collateral posting has a cost.  So why might member banks find it privately worthwhile to post more collateral than they generally use? The costs and benefits of posting collateral in CHAPS Sterling A bank can obtain collateral to post with the Bank of England (ie eligible securities) through different channels.  First, a bank may already have eligible securities outright on its books.  In this case a bank can simply repo those securities to the Bank of England.  A second channel, if a bank lacks eligible securities on its books, is for it to borrow money on the interbank loan market, use that money to reverse-repo in eligible securities and then repo those securities to the Bank of England. The opportunity cost of obtaining collateral through the reverse-repo channel equals the cost of obtaining an interbank loan minus the rate the bank gets by lending the money out again through reverse-repo. We assume that banks can borrow at the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) and that they can lend at the secured-lending repo rate.1 The cost of obtaining eligible sterling-denominated securities through this channel thus equals Libor minus the repo rate.  A bank with eligible sterling-denominated securities could, instead of using them as collateral, use those securities to borrow money at the secured lending repo rate and then lend that money on the interbank market at Libor.  It follows that a bank that uses existing sterling-denominated eligible securities forgoes a return equal to Libor minus the repo rate. So, one measure of the opportunity cost of posting collateral equals Libor minus the repo rate.2 Using overnight Libor and repo rate data from the British Bankers Association, the spread averages around seven basis points over the period (Chart 4).3 So far we have discussed the costs of posting collateral.  The benefit of posting additional collateral is that member banks can avoid the costs associated with delaying or cancelling payments.  We can measure this benefit as the probability that the bank uses the marginal unit of collateral to make a payment multiplied by the cost that would have been associated with being unable to make that payment or only making it with a delay.  For example, these costs might result from a bank failing to provide time-sensitive payment services to its customers;  not meeting its CLS payment obligations on time4;  or failing to satisfy throughput guidelines.5 Given the cost of posting collateral and an assumed cost of delaying and cancelling payments, one can then determine how much of a collateral buffer it would be worth a member bank posting. Consider the marginal costs and benefits of posting an additional £1 million of collateral.  If the opportunity cost of posting collateral equals seven basis points, then the cost of posting this collateral for one year equals £700.  If the loss the bank suffers from being unable to make a payment equals 1% of the value of that payment (£10,000 for the £1 million of collateral), then the bank would be willing to post a marginal £1 million of collateral 102 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – Collateral posting decisions in CHAPS Sterling (1) The Libor and repo rates, at a particular maturity, capture the interest rates charged on unsecured and secured inter-bank loans, respectively, at that maturity. For more details on the calculations see http://www.bba.org.uk/bba/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1 41 (2) The opportunity cost for eligible euro-denominated securities obtained through the reverse-repo channel should be the Euribor/euro repo rate (eg Eurepo) spread. (3) Although we focus on the overnight Libor/repo rate spread, banks can obtain sterling-denominated collateral through the reverse-repo channel at longer maturities. (4) The Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) system is a system for the settlement of foreign exchange transactions.  Member banks must make payments to CLS Bank by scheduled times during the day.  If a bank fails to make its CLS payments by the deadlines it may incur penalties levied by CLS Bank International.  For more details on CLS see http://www.cls-group.com. (5) The throughput guidelines are that CHAPS Sterling members must, over a calendar month, ensure that on average 50% of its daily payments, by value, are made by 12 pm and that 7 5%, by value, are made by 2.30 pm. 10 5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 Aug.

Even if the costs were as low as the Libor/repo rate spread (seven basis points), the bank would be willing to post the £1 million even if it were used only once a year. In a competitive market, where customers can switch banks in the event of poor service (and not making time-sensitive payments for customers would count as poor service) and where banks face other costs from not making timely payments, a seven basis point or higher cost penalty on missed payments seems plausible.  If this is the case, then banks will find it privately worthwhile to post collateral that they seldom use.  If all CHAPS Sterling member banks behave in this way, and do not realise extreme collateral demands simultaneously, then the system as a whole will have more collateral available than is ever used.  This additional collateral in turn provides the resilience that we observe in practice in the CHAPS Sterling system. Determinants of collateral posting decisions We can test what factors explain CHAPS Sterling banks’ collateral posting behaviour using econometric techniques.  Specifically we can look at the relationship between collateral posted, demand factors and the cost of posting collateral.  Summary statistics on these variables are in Table 1. The sample period covers 1 July 2003 to 30 July 2004.  We measure the collateral each member bank could reasonably expect to need by supposing that this is related to a bank’s mean maximum collateral used and the variance of its maximum collateral used.  These factors might be thought to capture, respectively, member banks’ average transaction demand for collateral and their precautionary demand for collateral.  We expect collateral posted to be positively related to both of these variables.1 We use a 30-day window to estimate the value of the collateral a bank can reasonably expect ever to use because the bank’s payment business may change over time.2 We use one measure of the cost of posting collateral, the overnight Libor/repo rate spread.3 However, in practice, this cost could apply to CHAPS Sterling member banks to varying degrees because of differences in the regulatory requirements to which banks are subject.  In particular, UK retail banks are subject to liquidity requirements set by the Financial Services Authority.  These requirements – the Sterling Stock Liquidity Regime (SLR) – require the relevant banks (SLR banks) to hold liquid assets on their balance sheets to cover possible liquidity demands.4 The set of assets a bank may hold to meet the SLR requirements largely overlaps with the set of assets the Bank of England accepts as eligible collateral for CHAPS Sterling.  Moreover, the value of the assets SLR banks hold to comply with these regulations exceeds the value of collateral they post in CHAPS Sterling.  Since the SLR requirements apply only at the end of the day, SLR banks can use these SLR assets as CHAPS Sterling collateral during the day, but they cannot repo these assets to obtain cash to lend overnight on the interbank market.  Hence, for SLR banks, the opportunity cost of posting collateral in CHAPS Sterling may be less than the Libor/repo rate spread.  Banks in the United Kingdom that are not subject to the SLR are subject to the Maturity Mismatch (MM) Regime instead.5 The liquidity requirement under the MM Regime is based upon net outflows over short future time horizons.  A mismatch occurs if contracted outflows exceed contracted inflows within a specified time band (eg day T to day T+8).  If a bank’s outflows and inflows balance, liquidity regulations will not require it to hold assets Collateral posting decisions in CHAPS Sterling – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 103 (1) This is a very simple way of modelling how banks form expectations about how much collateral they need and we do not claim that it precisely reflects how banks do form their expectations.  Banks could process the information provided by past payments flows in a much more sophisticated way than the model suggests and also base expectations on information that we cannot observe, such as payment requests that they know that they will receive over the day. (2) The mean and variance of the maximum collateral used on day t is calculated over the 30 previous days in the sample. (3) We lag the Libor/repo rate spread by one day because we are examining the levels of collateral posted at the beginning of the day. (4) The CHAPS Sterling member banks that are subject to the SLR regime are Barclays, Clydesdale, Co-operative Bank, HBOS, HSBC Bank, Lloyds TSB, Royal Bank of Scotland/Nat West and Standard Chartered. (5) The CHAPS Sterling member banks that are subject to the MM regime are ABN-Amro, Citibank and Deutsche Bank. Table 1 Summary statistics Mean Interquartile range Collateral posted at 7 am (£ billions) 2.48 0.34 – 3.71 Mean maximum collateral used (£ billions) 1.86 0.26 – 2.88 Variance of the maximum collateral used 0.72 0.03 – 1.10 Libor/repo spread (basis points) 7 3 – 9  104 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – Collateral posting decisions in CHAPS Sterling that it could also use as collateral in CHAPS Sterling. For MM banks the Libor/repo spread could be much closer to their true cost of posting sterling-denominated collateral. We would expect collateral posting behaviour to vary between member banks.  So we control for bank specific factors by estimating collateral posting behaviour with a panel estimator, which allows for bank-specific fixed effects.  The regression results are shown in Table 2. The demand-side measures of collateral use have the correct sign and are all highly significant in both a statistical and an economic sense.  To illustrate: increasing mean maximum collateral used from its 25th percentile value of £0.26 billion to its 7 5th percentile value of £2.88 billion leads to a £1.23 billion rise in collateral posted at 7 am. Increasing the variance of the maximum collateral used from its 25th percentile value to its 7 5th percentile value leads to a £0.32 billion increase in collateral posted at 7 am.  The transactions and precautionary demand for collateral therefore appear to be important determinants of collateral posting behaviour. The opportunity cost of posting collateral (measured by the Libor/repo spread) variable also has the economically correct sign (as the opportunity cost of posting collateral increases) and is statistically significant.  However, this effect is economically small. Increasing the spread from its 25th percentile value to its 7 5th percentile value leads to a fall in collateral posted at 7 am of only £0.07 billion. Conclusions CHAPS Sterling could continue to function even in the face of an operational event that temporarily prevented a single member bank from making payments.  This robustness occurs largely because member banks post more collateral than they normally need to support their payment activities.  This puzzling behaviour can be explained if the reputation cost to a bank of failing to provide time-sensitive payment services to customers is high relative to the cost of posting collateral.  Empirical evidence supports this explanation.  This liquidity cushion in turn provides CHAPS Sterling with its resilience.

Collective Action Clauses (CACS):  an analysis of provisions included in recent sovereign bond issues (summary) – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 105 A RECENT paper published by the Bank, by John Drage and Catherine Hovaguimian analyses the provisions contained in recent sovereign bond issues, focusing on the inclusion of collective action clauses. The financial stability paper is available at http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/ fsr/fsr17art9.pdf The proposition that the introduction of Collective Action Clauses (CACs) could improve the crisis resolution framework came to prominence in the aftermath of the Mexican crisis in 1 995 through the publication of the Rey Report.1 While CACs have been common in several jurisdictions where sovereign bonds are issued (England, Luxembourg and Japan), they were uncommon in sovereign bonds issued under New York law.  And, despite the growing recognition that the framework for resolving crises was deficient, there was little change in New York market practice in the years immediately following the Mexican crisis.  In 2002, G10 Ministers and Governors asked a Working Group to develop a set of model CACs for sovereign bond issues, with the aim of catalysing a change in market practice.  Around the same time, seven private sector trade associations developed their own ‘model features’ for CACs in sovereign bonds issued under New York and English law.2 Shortly afterwards, in February 2003, Mexico issued a foreign currency sovereign bond under New York law containing CACs.  Mexico’s bond issue proved to be a turning point and, as Chart 1 shows, the majority of foreign currency sovereign bonds issued in New York and elsewhere now contain CACs. Drage and Hovaguimian analyse the clauses included in foreign currency sovereign bonds issued under New York law since February 2003, comparing them with three key objectives identified by the 2002 G-10 Working Group.3 The Working Group concluded that contractual clauses had the potential to make the process for restructuring sovereign bonds more (1) See www.bis.org/publ/gten03.pdf for a copy of the 1 996 G10 Report on The Resolution of Sovereign Liquidity Crises – the ‘Rey Report’ .

(a) Central government only. Collective Action Clauses (CACS): an analysis of provisions included in recent sovereign bond issues (summary) John Drage and Catherine Hovaguimian, International Finance Division, Bank of England A recent Financial Stability paper published by the Bank assesses the extent to which recent contractual innovations in foreign currency sovereign bonds issued under New York law may contribute to the creation of a more orderly framework for restructuring sovereign bonds.  Contractual clauses can be designed to facilitate collective agreement between all creditors to achieve a comprehensive restructuring; improve information exchange between a sovereign and its creditors;  and discourage disruptive individual litigation.  orderly by: (1) fostering early dialogue, coordination, and communication among creditors and a sovereign caught up in a sovereign debt problem; (2) ensuring that there are effective means for creditors and debtors to re-contract, without a minority of debt-holders obstructing the process; and (3) ensuring that disruptive legal action by individual creditors does not hamper a workout that is under way, while protecting the interests of the creditor group. The paper shows that the most important of the three objectives, providing effective means for creditors and debtors to recontract, has been achieved through the widespread inclusion of majority action provisions (thus binding in minorities and hold-out creditors). Market standards are also evolving with regard to disenfranchisement provisions (excluding bonds held directly or indirectly by the issuer from being voted), hurdles for acceleration and deceleration, and rules for voting on non-reserved matters – all of which contribute to this objective. However, the analysis in the paper also shows that the actual clauses adopted thus far by issuers do little to further the other two key objectives identified by the G10 Working Group:  fostering early dialogue, coordination, and communication between creditors and sovereigns involved in a sovereign debt problem; and ensuring that disruptive legal action by individual creditors does not hamper a workout that is under way.  Drage and Hovaguimian therefore conclude that the collective action clauses now being included in sovereign bonds issued under New York law are a most welcome step, but that there is scope for further beneficial market innovation. The authors highlight three areas where innovation could help improve the framework for sovereign debt restructuring. ● First, the introduction of provisions for the appointment of a bondholder representative (who is empowered to act on behalf of all bondholders when requested to do so by an agreed percentage of the holders of an issue) could help to minimise the prospects of disruptive individual litigation against the sovereign and ensure the equal distribution of the benefits of any litigation to all bondholders. ● Second, given the number of bonds some countries can have outstanding simultaneously, clauses that facilitate the aggregation of majority action provisions over a number of different issues could also help facilitate comprehensive restructurings.  If achievable, aggregation could significantly contribute to the speed at which sovereign restructurings are negotiated.  Thus far only the new bonds issued by Uruguay have contained limited forms of aggregation clauses. ● Third, the inclusion of some more explicit collective action provisions in the original documentation for syndicated loans could help because sovereigns also need to have ways in which to restructure their other (non-bonded) debts if the objective of creating an orderly system for sovereign debt restructurings is to be realised fully.  (Although the Working Group did not address this directly, it expressed the “expectation that practices developed with respect to sovereign bonds could be implemented with appropriate modifications in other types of debt over time.”) 106 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – Collective Action Clauses (CACS):  an analysis of provisions included in recent sovereign bond issues (summary)  Financial instrument accounting – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 107 Introduction1 The recent furore over IAS 39 – the international accounting standard for financial instruments – has resulted in a situation which I think all agree is unsatisfactory.  We now effectively have two versions of IAS 39, one proposed by the IASB, the other by the European Commission. I probably do not need to emphasise that meaningful accounting standards and their effective implementation are highly relevant to any central bank’s responsibilities for financial stability.  They help to ensure the safe and efficient functioning of the financial system.  So it is essential that accounting standards have a clear economic rationale, promote comparability and secure adequate disclosure.  Only in that way can investors, creditors and others judge the positions and risks being run by financial institutions and hence exert market discipline, and perverse incentives be avoided. Together these can make an important contribution to financial stability. I suggest later that, despite intensive work to improve accounting standards for financial instruments in recent years, fundamental issues with financial stability implications remain to be resolved.  One crucial question is:  ‘Who and what are accounts for?’ Another more specific issue is the appropriate role of fair value data.  So what I want to do this morning is to discuss these issues in turn before commenting on the way forward regarding IAS 39.  I should add that while IAS 39 applies to all users of financial instruments, I illustrate its implications below with particular reference to banking. Who and what are accounts for? It is widely accepted that published audited accounts are prepared first and foremost for the owners of a business, that is the shareholders.  However, it is often maintained that this information also meets the needs of other stakeholders, including creditors, customers, employees and so on. And so it does up to a point.  Yet there are many users who have an interest in the financial position of a firm.  On the face of it, it would be rather surprising if a single presentation was ideal for all of them.  Let me try to illustrate this for the financial world – where the Bank’s financial stability remit runs – by looking at the respective needs of shareholders, depositors and regulators of banks. Shareholders are particularly interested in the returns being earned by a bank (its profitability), both current and prospective.  They are looking mainly at the economic value of the going concern.  The focus of depositors, regulators and authorities concerned with systemic stability, on the other hand, is likely to be on whether bank liabilities will be repaid on demand or when due.  Two specific examples may help to illustrate these different perspectives:  the treatment of ‘own-credit risk’ and the valuation of sight deposits. (1) The author is grateful to his colleagues Alastair Clark and Ian Michael for their help in preparing this speech. Financial instrument accounting Sir Andrew Large, Deputy Governor, Financial Stability, Bank of England This is the text of a speech delivered by Sir Andrew Large, the Bank of England’s Deputy Governor for Financial Stability, to the thirteenth City of London Central Banking Conference on 22 November 2004.  He emphasises the part which well-designed accounting standards can play in maintaining financial stability.  He also notes the differences of view on IAS 39 (a standard dealing with financial instruments), which persist despite the efforts of the International Accounting Standards Board to achieve consensus, and suggests that in looking longer term towards a revision of IAS 39 it might be helpful to take a pace or two back and seek a shared understanding on a number of fundamental issues.  These include the question of who and what accounts are for, whether, and if so how, fair value measures can be accommodated alongside historic cost measures and the implications of a wider application of fair values for the volatility of accounting results.  ‘Own-credit risk’ arises from the ‘fair value option’ in IAS 39, which allows an entity to fair value not only its assets but also its liabilities.  On that basis, the value of liabilities, including deposits, should fall as an entity’s creditworthiness deteriorates.  Here we find a difference of perspective between shareholders on the one hand and debt holders, including depositors (and by extension regulators and central banks), on the other.  In an economic sense, given that the equity interest in a company cannot fall below zero, as net worth diminishes debt holders bear a growing proportion of reductions in asset values.  But this approach is in tension with the understandable concern of bank depositors and regulators about the capacity of banks to repay liabilities at par when due, and who therefore want measures of net worth constructed on that basis. A separate issue arises in arriving at a fair valuation of sight deposits.  For such deposits, there is typically a difference between the contractual maturity (zero) and the behavioural maturity (the time over which sight deposits are held in practice).  Since the interest paid on such deposits is almost always less than the market discount rate, once any maturity greater than zero is admitted the fair valuation of the deposit will be less than par.  But once again, depositors are likely to be more interested in the financial strength of a bank assessed on the basis that deposits are ascribed their full nominal value.  Moreover, any suggestion in public accounts that deposits are worth less than par could undermine the confidence on which the whole construct of banking is based. These illustrations suggest that different users of accounts may, at least to an extent, want information produced on different bases.  And the simple fact is that we will not be able to make progress if different users all assert that their way of calculating or presenting the numbers is uniquely correct.  I suggest, therefore, that the users of accounts should recognise that they may in reality need to adjust them to suit their particular purposes – something ratings agencies and other analysts have done for many years. It is encouraging that the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has adopted precisely that approach in promulgating various adjustments for regulatory purposes to data based on IAS 39. Against that background, it would seem helpful if accounting standard setters required supplementary disclosures in published accounts which would allow different users to make such adjustments.  This is important given that, unlike regulatory, fiscal and other public authorities, many private sector users are not in a position easily to obtain information beyond that put in the public domain. Let me turn now to IAS 39 itself as it impacts on the banking industry. IAS 39 and the banking industry IAS 39 has proved controversial with bankers for reasons which stem partly from specific features of banking, and partly from the implications of the wider use of fair values, particularly in accounting for hedges and in so far as they may lead to greater volatility of published profits. Some pros and cons of fair value accounting The debate about the use of fair values raises a number of important issues, including the relevance of unrealised valuation changes, the appropriate assumptions on the holding period and the reliability of fair values.  It also raises a question about the extent to which accounting valuations should move away from a going concern paradigm to break-up valuations, which, at least at first sight, is closer to what ‘fair values’ represent.  But at the same time, fair values are in some ways more forward looking, since expectations about the future performance of assets and liabilities are reflected in market valuations.  It will not have escaped you, however, that the move in recent years to a more securitized world, with increased capacity for rapid risk transfer, encourages the appetite for a more forward looking approach. A fair value approach has a number of other attractions.  For example, it promotes consistency of valuation of instruments in different financial sectors, something increasingly important given the fungibility between banking, securities and insurance. It will generally lead to more timely recognition of losses (for example, on bank loans), and it captures the crystallisation of market risk in non-trading positions.  Moreover, fair value accounting is consistent with the increasing use of mark-to-market techniques in risk management.  Such techniques in part reflect a progressive but fundamental shift from the traditional banking approach of holding assets until maturity to today’s approach of managing on the basis of continually assessing the opportunity cost of maintaining the existing balance sheet.  It is clearly beneficial to transparency if publicly available 108 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – Financial instrument accounting  accounting information as far as possible reflects the basis on which management actually run a business. However, there are a number of complications associated with the wider use of fair values. First, there is a question as to how one can obtain robust fair values for instruments which are not priced, even indirectly, in reasonably deep and liquid markets.  Model-based valuation techniques may be used, but they may not be analogous to genuine market clearing prices.  The issues here include determining the conceptual basis for valuation (‘the model’), obtaining the necessary inputs, and avoiding slavish adherence to a model which may in some circumstances deliver misleading results.  In other words how, and to what extent, can human judgement properly be used to modify the model? Second, there is the question of the economic relevance of unrealised gains and losses – particularly if they are not immediately realisable.  For example, while information on changes in the fair value of bank loans conveys useful economic insights, it needs to be interpreted carefully.  In many cases, a gain cannot be realised ‘up front’ given the absence at present of developed secondary markets in bank loans – even if securitisation may be increasing in that area. Volatility Further concerns about wider use of fair value accounting relate to the possible implications for volatility in financial markets and in the economy more widely.  In my view, there is an important distinction to be drawn between accounting rules which capture accurately the volatility inevitably present in the real world, and ‘spurious’ volatility introduced by the accounting rules themselves. Few I hope would suggest that we should remove genuine economic volatility from accounting numbers. It is surely better for users to apply their own smoothing to data if they think that is justified rather than impose smoothing rules, which can both be arbitrary and may serve to obscure the underlying data, through obligatory accounting standards. Recent experience in the US and the UK is encouraging in these respects.  The widening use of fair values does not seem to have had an adverse impact on the stability of the US financial system, on the equity prices of US banks, or on banks in Europe which have adopted US or international accounting standards.  And the move in the UK to a pensions standard with a strong fair value flavour (FRS 17) initially led to strong reactions, but over time I think has led to a better understanding of the actual economics of pension arrangements. At the macro-economic level, concern has been expressed that greater use of fair values could have a procyclical impact.  Banks’ assets might be marked up in booms, as perceived credit risk declined, so boosting banks’ capital base and capacity for further lending.  However, for the concerns about intensifying economic cycles to be realised two linkages would need to operate.  First, the impact on bank capital would have to increase the volume of bank lending and, second, the increase in bank lending would need to have significant implications for real activity.  Neither linkage can be taken for granted, and in any case discretionary policy action, whether monetary or prudential, by the authorities may mitigate any pro-cyclical effects. As I have indicated, we do, however, need to avoid accounting rules which introduce spurious volatility. An example, to which I will return in a moment, is the hedge accounting under IAS 39. The ‘mixed attribute’ model The drawbacks of fair values in some contexts have led to widespread support in the banking industry for retaining the current ‘mixed attribute’ accounting approach.  While IAS 39 requires trading instruments, derivatives and many securities to be measured at fair value, bank loans generally continue to be measured at historic cost.  However, the debate about IAS 39 has highlighted some difficulties with this mixed approach as it is presently formulated. The area of greatest difficulty has proved to be hedges which straddle the two measurement bases, where so-called hedge accounting comes into play. One example of this is the use of interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk in a portfolio of fixed rate loans funded from floating rate deposits. Without modification of the mixed attribute model, such hedges could actually create, not reduce, accounting volatility, because derivatives are required to be marked to market, that is measured at ‘fair value’ , while loans are generally booked at cost. This to me would seem perverse indeed! Financial instrument accounting – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 109  Another important example arises with the use of credit derivatives as hedges.  This has proved difficult more generally to fit into the IAS 39 framework. I should add that the sheer complexity of the hedge accounting rules is also an issue, as the debate in Europe about the treatment of sight deposits and prepayments, and the problems at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the US, well illustrate.  We need to ensure that the rules themselves do not result in perverse behaviour as people try to find a way around them. The way forward So where do we go from here? All of the above factors have complicated the debate on IAS 39.  And in my view, the only way forward is first to take a few steps back, before work starts on re- engineering the standard.  I believe that many of those interested in the debate would be supportive of this approach. We perhaps need to look again at the process for considering, and reaching a conclusion about, the fundamental ‘design parameters’ some of which I have touched on today.  This is no small task, but if agreement could be reached on the fundamentals, these could be stated as clear principles in a preamble to any new standard, to guide the more detailed requirements.  And it might enable the widely-held vision of a less detailed and prescriptive standard to be realised, to replace the hundreds of pages of complex rules. To address this, however, raises three questions: (i) On what is early consensus necessary? (ii) How should the transition be approached?  And (iii) What does this mean in institutional terms? Early consensus Early agreement seems to me particularly important in three areas. The first is to review the conventional understanding on who the accounts are for, and clarify how the different interests of different stakeholders are to be met. The second is to agree where the standard should be placed along the spectrum between historic cost and fair value measurement.  A particularly difficult conceptual question in this area is:  precisely what economic meaning is there in so-called fair valuation of instruments in which (a) there is little or no secondary market, or (b) there is a market, but a clear intent to hold an instrument to maturity? Finally, the implications of any increase in measured volatility will need to be assessed.  Here, I see a need for a process of communication and education by companies and others to shareholders, analysts and other interested parties, which should form part of the transition to any new standard. Transitional considerations Once the above objectives have been agreed, it will be important to articulate where we are, and where we want to be, and then to identify the optimal migration path.  Is it to be a gradual transition or a big bang? Such decisions would need to consider:  the rapidly moving environment of the financial industry, and regulatory techniques;  how to ensure comparability is maintained;  and the costs, especially in system terms, of alternative migration paths. Procedures for setting international accounting standards A final issue concerns the procedures for setting accounting standards.  Concerns have been expressed by some about whether public sector interests, in particular, are adequately represented in the process. There is of course a clear public interest in meaningful reporting and adequate disclosure. I am sure that standard setters in this, as in other areas, are alive to these issues.  Equally they have – and in my view quite rightly – a concern to avoid, or at least minimise, the influence of overtly political factors.  In considering the future of the IASB’s governance, I am sure that the Trustees will be reflecting carefully on the issue of what constitutes legitimate public policy interests and how best to respond to them. Concluding remarks To sum up, the importance of meaningful and reliable accounting information is clear.  It reflects the growth of publicly-traded markets, coupled with rapid growth in innovation and complexity.  The potential for opacity has therefore increased, so it is essential that accounting standards are clear and capture the economic substance.  This is important for the various stakeholders, and for financial stability generally. 110 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – Financial instrument accounting  It is also important that the actual processes for developing accounting standards command widespread support from companies, investors, creditors and the public authorities.  I have set out a few steps that might be of relevance in achieving this. On IAS 39 specifically, it would seem to me sensible to try first to reach consensus on the fundamental issues I started with before moving to detailed drafting of a new accounting standard.  This will require a continuing effort on the part of standard setters to engage all interested parties, flexibility from everyone involved and a high level of transparency within the process.  A lofty goal perhaps, but important if the benefits are to be secured and we are to avoid the cacophony of today. In conclusion, although I have focused on controversies in accounting, we should recognise that we may be on the threshold of a truly significant step forward in accounting practice.  From next year, companies throughout the European Union will be using the same set of high quality, international accounting standards.  And there is the tantalising prospect of convergence between international and American standards.  The challenge now is to realise the full potential of these changes. Financial instrument accounting – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 111  112 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – Bank stability and transparency IN THE WAKE of the experience of the banking crises in Mexico (1 994) and the south east Asian and east Asian economies (1 997), official bodies, including the IMF (see Fischer, 1 999) and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2003) have called for increased transparency of banking firms.  These calls relate to the suspicion that ‘recent crises owe some of their intensity to a general lack of transparency about the sizes of positions that had been built up by both borrowers and lenders’ and that ‘practices and policies responsible for the depth of recent crises would not have been undertaken, had they been required to be made public’ (Fischer, 1 999, page 563). As a policy response, the stated aim of Pillar 3 disclosures introduced by the revised Basel Accord is to provide incentives for banks to ‘more prudently manage their risks’ . However, there could be an important trade-off relating to increases in transparency.  In particular, while the hope is that enhanced transparency may improve incentives ex ante, it is perhaps less clear whether transparency is necessarily a good thing ex post, when a bank might have hit hard times and provision of information could perhaps have a destabilising effect.  This article provides a synopsis of these different effects and also provides some new evidence in an attempt to clarify empirically whether ‘net’ , transparency is likely to reduce or increase bank stability. Ex ante effects of transparency A number of papers have explored the idea that transparency could be beneficial ex ante.  The main idea is that increased transparency enhances market discipline on banks.1 In particular, the key argument is that bank transparency increases the sensitivity of the bank’s funding terms to the risk it takes and that this in turn can create incentives for the bank to control its risk (ex ante discipline).  For instance, in Boot and Schmeits (2000) the degree of transparency determines the likelihood that investors in bank liabilities learn the extent of the monitoring and screening effort invested by the bank.  This effort in turn determines the bank’s risk of default, as increased monitoring is assumed to be associated with a lower probability of failure.  Since effort is costly, in the absence of transparency the bank will choose low levels of monitoring, resulting in high risk. As transparency increases, monitoring effort and thus risk become more easily observable, implying that the bank will face a higher short-term funding cost for low levels of screening effort.  Consequently, at high levels of transparency, the bank will choose a higher expected monitoring effort and thus a lower risk profile.  Similarly, Cordella and Yeyati (1 998) present a model where a bank’s funding terms are more favourable if the bank chooses lower levels of risk.  In this model the funding terms are determined after the bank has chosen its risk of default.  When depositors can observe the level of risk chosen by the bank, the bank chooses low levels of risk since it would otherwise be punished by a high required interest rate on its funds.  By contrast, when the level of risk cannot be observed by lenders, the bank has no way to commit to a low level of risk. In equilibrium lenders assume that the bank will choose a high level of risk and charge an interest rate appropriate to that. The (1) See, for example, Cordella and Yeyati (1 998), Boot and Schmeits (2000), Hyytinen and Takalo (2003). Bank stability and transparency Erlend Nier, Financial Industry and Regulation Division, Bank of England A number of recent policy initiatives have called for enhanced transparency of banking firms.  While the hope is that enhanced transparency may improve incentives ex ante, it is less clear whether transparency is necessarily a good thing ex post, when a bank might have hit hard times and provision of information could have a destabilising effect. This article provides a synopsis of these different effects and also provides some new evidence in an attempt to clarify empirically whether in the long run, taking ex ante and ex post effects together, transparency is likely to reduce or increase bank stability.  The analysis suggests that, on balance, transparency reduces the chance of severe banking problems and thus enhances overall financial stability.  bank, in turn, knows that it will not be rewarded for a low level of risk and chooses a high level of risk in equilibrium. These arguments, relating transparency to improved ex ante incentives, have also started to be documented empirically.  In particular, a paper by Baumann and Nier (2003) showed that banks that disclose more information about their risk profile tended to choose a lower risk of default. Ex post effects of transparency While these studies suggest that increasing the level of transparency may reduce bank risk-taking and improve bank stability ex ante, it may be less clear whether transparency is a good idea ex post, ie when an adverse shock has occurred and the bank is already in difficulty.  There are two arguments here. On the one hand, transparency could be ‘bad’ ex post if it further destabilises banks that are hit by exogenous shocks. In particular, one may be concerned that market responses may aggravate the position of a bank which is suffering from temporary and recoverable weakness and that market responses are more accentuated when more information is provided.1 Indeed, in their paper, Cordella and Yeyati (1 998) show that when the bank’s risk profile is hit by a shock outside of the bank’s control – such as a macroeconomic shock – bank transparency reduces bank stability since it results in investors demanding higher yields in response to the shock, compounding the bank’s problems.  But since the shock to the bank is assumed to be exogenous, there is no offsetting ‘dividend’ in terms of a lower choice of risk ex ante. In a similar spirit, Furman and Stiglitz (1 998) suggest that ‘greater transparency would have greatly aggravated the banking crisis in the United States in the 1 980s, because many major banks would have had to shut down, greatly curtail their lending or receive substantial injections of equity’ (page 69). On the other hand, transparency could be ‘good’ ex post if it limits informational contagion to banks that are not exposed to the same shock.  That is, transparency could help markets and depositors distinguish between those banks that are insolvent and those banks that are fundamentally sound.  With poor transparency depositors need to make such a distinction based on a limited set of information, increasing the risk that a crisis spreads from one bank to another.  With high transparency the problem may be more easily contained.  This point can be made more formally using the model by Gorton and Huang (2002).  In this paper, there are many banks that are hit by both a systematic (macroeconomic) shock and a bank-specific (idiosyncratic) shock.  Depositors can observe the former, but not the latter.  This means that for a bad enough realisation of the common macroeconomic shock, all the banks in the system face a depositor run.  In this model, if banks were transparent enough to allow depositors to observe the idiosyncratic shock – which might be favourable for some banks – only a fraction of the banks would be hit by a run.  In a similar vein, Giannetti (2003) has formalised the idea that international capital flows are subject to contagion as a result of asymmetric information between international investors and emerging market banks.2 Empirical evidence In sum, both theory and evidence suggest that transparency is ‘good’ ex ante, but it is less clear whether transparency might potentially be ‘bad’ ex post.  This begs the question: what is the net effect?  In particular, what is the effect of transparency on the likelihood and depth of banking problems and crises? In a recent paper, Barth, Caprio and Levine (2002) analysed the cross-sectional link between transparency and the incidence of banking crises in a cross-country sample of 51 countries during the late 1 980s and 1 990s.  Across countries, the incidence of a banking crisis was defined using an account of crises compiled by Caprio and Klingebiel (2003), while transparency was measured at the country level as a summary variable that included information on a number of features relating to the market’s ability to monitor banks.3 The Bank stability and transparency – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 113 (1) Morris and Shin (2002) formalised the idea that provision of public information may lead markets to overreact to potentially noisy public signals. (2) In the context of the recent emerging market crises, Ferguson (1 998) suggested that:  ‘Standards for the transparency of and disclosure of private financial information were extremely lax.  Once problems arose, it was difficult for creditors to distinguish good risks from bad and this caused them to withdraw their funds indiscriminately.’ (3) These were (i) whether banks’ accounts were required to be audited, (ii) the percentage of a country’s top 10 banks that were rated by a rating agency (iii) whether or not the country had an explicit deposit insurance scheme (iv) whether banks were required to disclose off-balance-sheet items, risk management procedures and non-performing loans and (v) whether subordinated debt counted as regulatory capital.  authors did not find a significant effect of transparency in these cross-country crises regressions.  This could suggest that ex ante and ex post effects cancel each other out. However, such cross-country analysis faces a number of difficulties.  First, whether or not a country experienced a banking crisis in a given year is hard to define with precision and requires judgement.1 Second, transparency of banks is a concept that is very difficult to measure.  Third, the incidence of banking crises is likely to be affected by a large number of factors, including macroeconomic influences.2 Fourth, in the face of these difficulties, the marginal impact of structural factors such as transparency is likely to be difficult to isolate in a cross-country set-up that offers only a small number of observations. Bank-level approach Recent research carried out at the Bank of England3 addresses some of these difficulties.  This research used annual data on 550 listed banks from 32 countries4 over the years 1 994–2000.  A number of the countries in the sample experienced a banking crisis during the sample period – eg Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, Turkey and Thailand – but most banks in the sample are from countries that did not experience a banking crisis during the period under study.  However, rather than analysing stability at the country level, this research defined crisis at the bank level, resulting in a large number of observations. A market indicator of bank crises In this study, large changes in banks’ stock prices were used as a market indicator of financial distress. Arguably, a bank is experiencing a crisis when its stock price drops dramatically in any given year. And crucially, the stock price response not only measures the extent to which risk has materialised, but should also incorporate the effect of any resulting responses in credit spreads the bank might be subject to. A bank was thus defined to be in crisis if its stock return fell into the lowest 5% of the unconditional distribution of annual equity returns for all banks and years in our sample.5 Using this, an indicator variable c(i,t) was constructed for each bank and year where c(i,t)=1 if the bank is in a crisis and c(i,t)=0 if it is not.  Box 1 provides an analysis of the distribution of this variable across countries and time.  In so doing it also explores how the frequency of bank crises, as defined here, is related to the incidence of country-wide banking crises, as defined by Caprio and Klingebiel (2003).  While a priori, there is little reason to expect this relationship to be exact, it turns out that there is a reasonably close mapping between the frequency of bank crises in our sample and the incidence of banking crises as identified by Caprio and Klingebiel. Bank-level measure of transparency The measure of transparency used in the study was based on how much information on its risk profile a bank provided in its annual accounts.  In particular, a disclosure index was constructed that records for 17 categories of possible disclosure whether or not the bank provides information in its published accounts as they are represented in the BankScope database.  Each of the chosen 17 categories is related to one or more dimensions of the bank’s risk-profile (interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk).  By summing across categories a composite measure of disclosure was created which was then normalised to take values between zero and 1.  This variable was evaluated bank by bank and for each year of our sample.6 As regards the disclosure index as a measure of transparency three caveats are in order.  First, the disclosure index only measures hard, quantifiable information and does not record differences in the 114 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – Bank stability and transparency (1) A number of lists of banking crises exist that differ in detail.  Eichengreen and Arteta (2000) analysed how these differences appear to affect the results of cross-country research into the causes of banking crises. (2) Barth, Caprio and Levine (2002) controlled for inflation prior to the onset of the crisis. (3) Nier (2004). (4) These are Austria, Australia, Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kindom and the United States. (5) It turned out in these cases the stock price fell by some 50% or more.  A return that is worse than minus 50% would therefore need to be thought of as a tail event that would indicate a severe problem. (6) A more detailed description of this variable can be found in Baumann and Nier (2004).  Bank stability and transparency – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 115 One way of validating market indicators of banking problems is to compare how they perform against a benchmark of known cases of banking crises ex post. Table A provides a heat-map of the distribution of our bank crisis variable across countries and years.  For each country and year it shows the average of c(i, t) or, equivalently, the frequency of a bank crisis under our measure.  While the definition of crisis in this paper is based on market returns, Caprio and Klingebiel (2003) define a systemic banking crisis as a situation where much or all of bank capital in a given country is exhausted.  Using some judgement in applying this definition, they provide an account of systemic and smaller banking crises across countries. According to this, systemic banking crises occurred in the following countries during our sample period: Argentina (1 995), Brazil (1 994–99), Finland (1 991–94), Indonesia (1 997–2002)1, Japan (1 991–2002), Korea (1 997–2002), Malaysia (1 997–2002), Poland (1 990s), Taiwan (1 997–98), Thailand (1 997–2002) and Turkey ( 2000–2002)1.  Applying a threshold of 10 percent to the average of c(i, t), ie 10% of banks in a country experienced stock returns of -50% or worse, provides a reasonably close map between the market indicator we use and the account offered by Caprio and Klingebiel (2003).  In particular, the market indicator catches the crises in Brazil, the south-east Asian crises in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, the east Asian crises in Taiwan and Korea, as well as the European crises in Turkey and Poland.  It does not, however, catch Argentina’s 1 995 crisis, nor the crises in Japan and Finland.  The latter two crises started well before our sample period begins, which may be one reason why one does not see stock market reactions during our sample period.  Moreover, in both countries banks have enjoyed continued government support, which might have limited stock market reactions:  see Hoggarth, Jackson and Nier (2003).  In addition, in some cases the market indicator records a crisis when there is none according to Caprio and Klingebiel (2003).  For instance, Hong Kong did not, during the 1 990s, experience a banking crisis, even though there was a large bank failure in 1 998.  High values on the market indicators for the years 1 994 and 1 997 and 1 998 might conceivably be due to contagion in this case.

Third, the disclosure index is based on an unweighted sum, which does not attempt to introduce a measure of the relative importance of the various components.2 Econometric analysis As explained above, in theory the effect of transparency is ambiguous.  Transparency may temper moral hazard and thus reduce the likelihood of crisis.  Transparency may also decrease the likelihood of information contagion, on average. However, for any individual bank hit by an exogenous shock transparency may be destabilising if it results in sharper market reactions than would otherwise occur. In order to investigate the net effect, probit regressions were undertaken that analysed the link between transparency and the likelihood of a bank experiencing a crisis.  The analysis accounted in addition for a number of macro- as well as bank-level factors in an attempt to isolate the effect of transparency from potentially confounding influences.  In particular, the results (Table 1, Column 1) account for differences at the macro level as regards the growth rate of real GDP , the current account position and the nominal short-term interest rate and differences across banks in size, exposure to general stock market movements (Beta) and profitability (ROA). Regression results The regression results shown in Table 1, Column 1 are statistically strong and suggest that more transparent banks are less at risk of crises, a finding that is statistically significant at the 5% level (with a P-value of 1%).  This is consistent with the argument that banks that disclose more information have better incentives to manage their risks (ex ante).  But it is also consistent with the idea that transparency reduces the risk of informational contagion that arises due to limited information on the part of depositors and investors (ex post).  Taken together these effects appear to dominate a potentially competing effect according to which (ex post) market reactions could be more pronounced for more transparent banks. Furthermore, the sign and size of macroeconomic and bank-specific control variables appear plausible. In particular, the current account variable is assigned a significantly negative sign, suggesting that a high current account deficit – and the resulting capital inflows – tend to have a destabilising effect on banks.3 Likewise, high short-term interest rates and high growth rates appear to increase the 116 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – Bank stability and transparency (1) For instance, many banks publish Value at Risk (VaR) numbers relating to their market risk in annual accounts.  However, there is no standard governing the presentation of this information.  The key assumptions underlying the VaR calculations, such as investment horizon and confidence level are not uniform across banks.  As a result the numbers are not comparable across banks and the information is not recorded in the BankScope database.  See Hoggarth et al (2003) for further discussion. (2) If disclosure is a noisy measure of true transparency, this would bias our findings against finding a significant effect.  In other words, the effect of transparency might be stronger than is measured by the disclosure index. (3) Further discussion of this point can be found in Radelet and Sachs (1 998).

In addition, as expected, larger and more profitable banks are less at risk of crises, while banks that are more exposed to general stock market movements – ie banks with a high beta – are more likely to experience dramatic stock market declines. The findings discussed above turned out to be robust to a number of changes to the detailed specification1. However, one potential concern with the analysis is that the disclosure variable might be endogenous.  An endogeneity problem might arise if there is an unobservable, or latent, variable that determines both the decision to disclose information and the likelihood of crisis.  In particular, it is conceivable that banks that are crisis-prone decide to provide little information, because they want to hide their true state, and that those same banks are more likely to experience a crisis for the same underlying reason. In order to investigate this possibility instrumental variables regressions were run, as follows:  in a first step, the disclosure variable was regressed on a number of observable exogenous regressors.  In a second step, the predicted value of this regression of the disclosure variable, which is a function of observable exogenous variables only, was used in the probit regression2.  Table 1, Column 2 reports the second stage regression using the predicted value of the first stage regression in lieu of the disclosure variable.  The results in Table 1, Column 2 suggest that endogeneity is not a major issue for our regression.  The coefficient on the instrumented disclosure variable retains both its sign and its level of economic significance, when compared to the benchmark result presented in Table 1, Column 1. Conclusions Policymakers have identified increases in bank transparency as one potential way to increase bank stability.  The idea is that more transparency strengthens market discipline and that this creates beneficial incentives ex ante.  However, policymakers might be concerned that the market discipline provided through more transparency might often be detrimental ex post, when market responses might tip ailing banks over the edge. This article has attempted to clarify this potential trade-off by examining, for a large sample of banks, whether transparency increases or decreases the chance of severe banking problems.  Our results suggest that to the extent that such a trade-off exists, the benefits of transparency for bank stability outweigh its costs.  We have found that banks that disclose more information are less at risk of falling into crisis.  This result suggests that transparency is able to improve bank stability and reduce the incidence of banking crisis.  These results thus also suggest that Basel II Pillar 3 disclosures could bring major dividends for overall financial stability, which should be protected when it comes to implementing Basel II. Bank stability and transparency – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 117 (1) This is discussed in more detail in Nier (2004). (2) The variables used in the first stage regressions include a number of bank-specific variables (loan ratio, return on equity, size, market share and the cost-income ratio).  In addition, we exploit the cross-country dimension of our dataset and include country dummy variables, which would reflect the average level of the disclosure in each country.  Since we know that disclosure varies through time, we also include a linear time trend as an explanatory variable.  Finally, to make sure that as a result of including year we do not create a variable that has a simple time trend, we interact year with the set of country dummy variables.  As a result the predicted change in the instrumented variable through time will be specific to each country and therefore mimic the actual change in that variable at the country level.  Again, this approach is motivated by a finding that the average change in disclosure is very different across countries.  118 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – Bank stability and transparency References Barth, J R, Caprio, G and Levine, R (2002), ‘Bank regulation and supervision:  what works best?’ , World Bank Working Paper.

Assessing risks from UK non-bank financial sectors – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 119 MUCH OF THE DISCUSSION of the UK financial system in the Review concentrates on the domestic banking sector, but there are many other financial institutions owned or operating in the UK.  Some engage in activities that are different to commercial banking, such as general insurance companies, which provide insurance for a range of risks;  pension funds, which support long-term saving;  and securities dealers, active in wholesale financial markets.  Others, such as credit unions and building societies, are quite similar to small domestically focused banks.  These varied sectors play a significant role in the economy, reflected in part by the scale of their financial liabilities (Chart 1). Most domestically owned banks focus primarily on retail banking, providing a range of services, such as savings products and loans or intermediation in payment systems, which are important for households and corporations.  They are also a potential conduit for the transmission of financial stresses through the financial system to the rest of the economy.  Banks have significant direct links to one another through interbank lending, and they have a key role in the operation of payment systems.  Moreover, banks are indirectly connected too.  Their role as monetary intermediaries – transforming deposits into illiquid loans – leaves them vulnerable to liquidity risk if there is a loss of confidence in the sector.  As such, while individual institutions might not be systemically important, the banking sector as a whole clearly is. And, given that disorder in the banking sector is typically manifested in pressures on the liquidity of individual institutions and the system, central banks’ role as liquidity providers means that they have a key part to play in dealing with such problems. While the potential knock-on effects of bank failures are reasonably clear, the wider disruption arising from the failure of non-banks is less obvious.  The potential for customers to withdraw their investments quickly is typically more limited, reducing the opportunities for strains in one non-bank to be quickly transmitted to other institutions in the sector. This means that the failure of one institution is less likely to disrupt a sector’s provision of financial services.  But there is still the potential for problems in non-bank sectors to threaten systemic financial stability.  Previous Reviews have discussed specific threats.  For example, in 2001 and 2002, falling UK and global equity prices reduced the solvency margins of the UK-resident life insurers.  The Review noted the potential threat posed by the industry’s Assessing risks from UK non-bank financial sectors Matthew Corder, Financial Industry and Regulation Division, Bank of England The assessment of the robustness of the UK financial system in each Financial Stability Review focuses primarily on the banking system, reflecting the importance of this sector for the maintenance of financial stability.  But there are many other types of financial institution resident in the United Kingdom, and these non-bank financial sectors may also have the potential to affect financial stability – both through their direct role as providers of financial services and through their links to other participants in the financial system.  This article sets out the framework we follow for assessing the risks to financial stability from UK-resident non-bank financial sectors.  In focusing on UK-resident sectors, this article does not cover non-UK institutions that may also pose risks to UK financial stability. 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 4,000 4,500 Banks Building societies Insurers/ pension funds All other financial institutions £ billions Chart 1 Unconsolidated financial liabilities of UK-resident financial institutions, 2004 Q2 Source:  ONS.  response to lower solvency levels, discussed the regulator’s response and highlighted links between insurers and banks. That episode also illustrated the potential for global financial markets to affect UK financial institutions adversely, and hence UK financial stability.  Global markets are, in turn, affected by non-UK financial institutions.  Foreign non-bank financial institutions have significant roles in capital markets, either as investors or as traders, where disruption to their activity could have a sufficiently large adverse impact on market functioning to threaten financial stability. In addition to the links through markets in which UK-resident institutions are participants, some individual foreign institutions, such as securities dealers or reinsurers, may have counterparty links to UK-owned banks which could have implications for domestic systemic stability.  Chapter two of the assessment article therefore discusses risks to and from these institutions and global financial markets more broadly. This article presents a framework for assessing which non-bank financial sectors have the greatest potential to threaten the stability of the UK financial system as a whole.  It focuses on UK-resident non-bank financial sectors, and so does not consider the risks to financial stability from non-UK financial institutions or international capital markets. Financial stability in theory and in practice A well functioning financial system should allow individuals to smooth their consumption across time or states of nature, and allow the efficient financing of investment projects with saved resources.1 And a financial system is stable if its capacity to fulfil these functions is robust to shocks to individual institutions’ balance sheets. Financial instability can arise when a shock does sufficient damage to the operations of an institution (or group of similar institutions) to cause substantial disruption to the functioning of the financial system. This can either be a direct result of the affected institution’s failure to provide services, or the result of links within the financial system, which spread disruption beyond the originally affected institution and thus indirectly inhibit the functioning of the whole system. Direct transmission through provision of financial services The UK-resident non-bank financial sectors provide a wide range of services, such as the provision of lending, asset management services, or insurance. The loss of these services could have a significant direct impact on the wider economy.  But this depends on two factors.  First, the service must play an important role in the economy.  This may be in terms of households’ and corporations’ holdings of financial assets or in their ability to undertake certain activities (for example, some activities require compulsory insurance under health and safety and other legislation).  Second, the failure of an individual non-bank must cause significant disruption to the provision of a financial service by other firms in that sector or other sectors.  Or the concentration of the sector and barriers to entry must be sufficient to make it difficult for other economic agents to arrange replacement provision of the affected financial services. Applying these criteria to banks, it is clear they meet the first criterion through their role as monetary intermediators and the use of bank deposits as stores of wealth and a means of payment.  Some banks might also meet the second criterion, depending, of course, on their size, the business they undertake and their links to other banks and capital markets.  Households and corporations use banks as intermediaries in the payment system, and so the failure of a bank could also disrupt the ability of its customers to make payments. The failure of a non-bank may also meet the criteria above, but the case is often less clear cut. For example, the failure of a general insurer usually results in a limited direct loss:  unless a claim has been lodged, a policyholder only loses the cover they had purchased.  The main disruption is the effect on individuals’/institutions’ activities as a result of a loss of insurance cover.  But the barriers to entry to the general insurance market are likely to be low, allowing substitute provision to be provided relatively quickly. The loss from the failure of a life insurer could be significant because of the large amount of wealth managed by such institutions.  However, because insurance contracts restrict policyholders’ ability to withdraw their investments quickly, problems in this 120 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – Assessing risks from UK non-bank financial sectors (1) Haldane, A, Saporta, V, Hall, S and Tanaka, M (2004), ‘Financial stability and macroeconomic models’ , Bank of England Financial Stability Review, June.  sector usually develop over a long period of time.  By giving consumers and markets longer to adjust, the impact of any problem is spread over time, reducing the potential for spill-over effects. Links to other financial sectors Even if disruption to a non-bank sector’s provision of financial services is unlikely to pose a direct threat to the financial system, such disruption may still have financial stability consequences through transmission to other financial sectors/markets that are systemically important.  There are three channels by which stresses from one financial sector could be transmitted through the rest of the financial system: counterparty exposures;  links through markets;  and effects on confidence. Counterparty exposures between firms expose them to a risk of default.  These exposures may arise through a variety of channels, such as banks’ lending to non-bank financial institutions or reinsurance provided to general and life insurers.  Financial conglomerates may also be exposed through their own participation in non-bank financial markets as owners of non-bank subsidiaries or as intermediaries selling third-party services.  In the event of a shock, a subsidiary may call on funds or capital from its parent.  So, for example, banks’ exposures to the life insurance sector through their ownership of life subsidiaries have been discussed in previous Reviews. In capital markets, sudden large asset sales by one financial institution, or the unwinding of major derivative positions, could, at least temporarily, distort asset prices and lead to a significant decline in market liquidity.  Sharp falls in asset prices could also affect other financial institutions by lowering the value of their assets (hence eroding their capital) or limiting their ability to hedge risks in capital markets. Confidence in financial service providers is an additional indirect connection between financial institutions. Concerns that problems in one financial institution might be symptomatic of problems in a wider group of firms may lead households or corporations to reallocate their investments or reduce their take-up of financial services – resulting in wider disruption to other institutions.  This is a key externality in the failure of a bank.  Because banks have liquid liabilities, they are vulnerable to bank runs resulting from a loss of confidence, so problems in one institution may spread quickly to others.  Shocks to consumer confidence may also affect non-bank sectors.  For example, sales of long-term savings products have fallen in recent years as a result of problems in the life insurance industry.  However, the less liquid nature of insurers’ liabilities means that this is unlikely to lead to a rapid withdrawal of funds. An assessment of UK-resident non-bank financial sectors’ potential threat to UK financial stability In gauging the potential for disorder in a UK-resident non-bank financial sector to spread through various channels and threaten financial stability, this article splits non-banks into nine distinct sectors, grouped into three broad categories by type of activity: 1. Credit grantors – building societies, credit unions, and ‘other finance providers’; 2. Investment institutions – life insurers and pension funds, asset managers, securities dealers, and hedge funds;  and 3. Non-life insurers – general insurers, and reinsurers. The variety of activities undertaken within the domestic non-bank financial sectors is reflected in the differences in the structure of the sectors and the source of the risks to which they are exposed. For example, UK credit unions operate almost entirely in the United Kingdom, and are mainly exposed to purely domestic risks.  Other types of UK-resident financial institution, such as life insurers, operate in the United Kingdom, but are exposed to global risks through their investments in international capital markets.  And hedge funds, securities dealers and reinsurers operate in global markets and are thus exposed to global risks.  These varied domestic and global risks are discussed regularly in the assessment article in the Review. The significance of each financial sector’s links to the financial system is assessed using the framework set out above.  The materiality of the risks to financial stability from a sector can be assessed by considering both the number of potential channels of contagion and the possible extent of financial stability risk for each channel.  Using this method, five UK non-bank financial sectors appear to warrant regular surveillance (Chart 2).  Other non-bank sectors, such as hedge funds, may also be relevant to UK financial stability and are regularly discussed in the assessment article in the Review.  But, as they are mainly Assessing risks from UK non-bank financial sectors – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 121  domiciled and operated outside the United Kingdom, they largely fall outside the scope of this article. The impact on financial stability is not uniform.  For example, the focus on banks is warranted by the materiality of their role in the financial sector across all four channels.  In contrast, ‘other finance providers’ have more limited connections to the rest of the financial system (through their association with banks).  And, while life insurers and pension funds also have links to the financial sector through all possible channels, these channels of contagion are not likely to be as significant as those for the banking sector.  So, while regulators will want to ensure that consumers are treated fairly and their investments are protected, from a systemic financial stability viewpoint life insurers and pension funds are unlikely to be as critical as banks. Credit grantors Building societies Building societies’ activities are similar to domestically focused banks, accepting deposits and providing lending (primarily mortgages).  They are, however, typically much smaller than banks, as indicated by the difference in the scale of their financial liabilities – UK-resident banks’ liabilities exceed £4.1 trillion, compared with just under £220 billion for building societies (Chart 1).  And banks’ direct exposures to the sector are small, with lending to building societies equivalent to less than 4% of Tier 1 capital (Chart 3). Nevertheless, building societies have significant links to households through both lending and deposit taking.  For example, they provided around 1 6% of secured lending during the first half of 2004 (Chart 4).  Moreover, the failure of a major building society may have confidence effects that could spread to the banking sector. Credit unions Credit unions are another form of deposit taker, but they are universally small in size.  At end-2002, the sector as a whole had total assets of less than £320 million, and the majority of credit unions have assets of less than £100,000.  Bank lending to such institutions is negligible, and the mutual ownership of credit unions means that there are no ownership links with the banking or non-bank financial sectors.  As a result, disruption to the sector is unlikely to pose a threat to the financial system more broadly. ‘Other finance providers’ (OFPs) This sector is composed of non-deposit-taking institutions that provide credit to households and corporations.  It includes financial leasing corporations, non-bank credit grantors and housing credit corporations.  OFPs have potentially important links to non-financial corporations and households as providers of credit.  In the first half of 2004, ‘other specialist lenders’ (a subset of OFPs) accounted for around 17% of unsecured lending and 44% of secured lending (Chart 4).  The sector also has significant links to banks through on-balance-sheet exposures and ownership links.  Loans to OFPs are equivalent to over 60% of the large UK-owned banks’ 122 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – Assessing risks from UK non-bank financial sectors Banks Building societies Credit unions Other finance providers Asset managers Securities dealers Life insurers and  pension funds General insurers Provision of financial services to households and corporations Counterparty exposures Capital markets Confidence Transmission channel Chart 2 Summary assessment of UK-resident financial sectors’ potential threat to UK systemic financial stability(a)(b) (a) The potential disruption to financial stability is indicated by the shading:  the greater the potential for disruption, the darker the shading.

Tier 1 capital (Chart 3), and all the large UK-owned banks own at least one OFP .  Because banks and OFPs both engage in domestic lending, the two sectors’ credit risk exposures are likely to be correlated.  So it is likely that any default by OFPs would occur at a time when banks’ domestic lending portfolios were themselves under strain, magnifying the impact on banks’ robustness. OFPs may therefore affect financial stability adversely because of their links to banks and their provision of lending to non-financial corporations and households. However, because alternative sources of credit are readily available – limiting the potential for the failure of an individual OFP to disrupt any particular market – it is sensible for surveillance of this sector to focus on the links between OFPs and banks. Investment institutions Investment institutions are firms whose prime activity is trading or investing in financial assets.  This covers a range of institutions.  At one end of the spectrum are asset managers, who manage assets on behalf of other institutions/individuals and do not carry any market risk on their own books.  Life insurers and pension funds also manage assets on behalf of others, but they carry at least some of the market risk associated with these investments.  And at the other extreme are securities dealers which, in addition to trading on behalf of others, also trade on their own behalf and carry any of the unhedged market risk from their investments. Asset managers The asset management sector covers a range of activities from managing assets for retail investors, to managing hedge funds.  But differences in the investment strategies of hedge funds, compared with other asset managers, may present different financial stability risks.  So hedge funds are considered separately. Although asset managers manage a large proportion of the asset holdings of life insurers, pension funds and individuals, they have limited asset holdings on their own balance sheet.  Their ability to initiate disruptive changes to asset holdings is limited by the terms of management contracts and their accountability to trustees, who define the range of asset classes in which they can invest.  Any disruption to financial markets caused by asset managers’ activities is therefore likely to be a result of a change in mandates received from clients.  And this will be driven by factors affecting the client rather than the asset manager.  Some banks and insurers own asset managers, but there is little risk of contagion through this channel as asset managers do not take market risks on their own book (reflecting the agency nature of the business).  So such subsidiaries pose little immediate risk to their parents’ solvency. Life insurers and pension funds Life insurers and pension funds are considered together as they have similar characteristics.  Both manage assets on behalf of others, and have significant freedom over their investment strategy. And both often hold at least some market risk on their books (rather than passing it onto the end investor).  This is particularly the case for defined-benefit pension schemes and with-profits products, where guaranteed payments and the smoothing of investment returns mean that the value of an institution’s assets and its liabilities to policyholders may not always be equal. There are, however, some significant differences between life insurers and pension funds. The most important is their capital base.  While life insurers have their own capital, defined-benefit pension funds’ deficits are a liability on their parent corporation’s balance sheet.  This adds to the leverage of the parent and is therefore an important part of any analysis of corporate balance sheets. Both UK-resident life insurers and pension funds have substantial holdings of marketable assets:  at end-2003, they had asset holdings of £972 billion and £693 billion respectively.  Together they hold approximately 35% of UK shares and 60% of gilts Assessing risks from UK non-bank financial sectors – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 123 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 1997 98 99 2000 01 02 03 04 - + £ billions Banks Building societies Other specialist lenders Chart 4 Net lending secured on UK residential property(a)(b) Source:  Bank of England. (a) Rolling twelve-month total. (b) Includes transfers and securitisations.  (Chart 5).  The large scale of the sector’s asset holdings means that an asset reallocation by life insurers and pension funds may have the potential to affect asset prices, at least temporarily, if large asset reallocations are made over a short period of time. In addition to their involvement in capital markets, life insurers and pension funds also have an important role as managers of long-term savings.  The sector manages around 50% of UK households’ financial assets.  It is also a provider of annuities – which are a legal requirement of private pension saving.  And the failure of a large life insurer has the potential to disrupt the annuity market. The sector also has some links to banks.  UK-owned banks’ lending to life insurers and pension funds is limited (at less than 7% of Tier 1 capital), but there are significant ownership links between life insurers and the UK banking sector.  Six of the large UK-owned banks have life insurance subsidiaries, with some accounting for over 10% of total group assets. Given the sector’s involvement in capital markets, links to banks, and the service they provide to households and corporations, life insurers and pension funds may have the potential to threaten UK financial stability.  But the recovery in equity markets over the past year has alleviated the immediate solvency pressure on insurance companies – reducing the risk from the sector. Securities dealers Banks may operate in wholesale markets, making transactions across their balance sheets, but there are also non-bank institutions which operate as stand-alone investment firms.  These institutions assist in the financing of investment though their management and underwriting of firms’ equity and debt issues, and through provision of consultancy services in mergers and acquisitions.  Securities dealers are also at the heart of many wholesale markets, both acting as market makers and trading on their own account.  In their proprietary trading, securities dealers take material positions and often follow trading strategies similar to hedge funds. Disruption to these activities could affect market liquidity or price volatility, inhibiting the efficient operation of markets. In addition to their involvement in markets, the sector also has significant links to UK-owned banks through on-balance-sheet exposures.  Lending to the sector is equivalent to over 30% of the ten large UK-owned banks’ Tier 1 capital, although much of this lending is likely to be collateralised. Given their substantial role in capital markets and strong links to banks, the sector may have the potential to pose a threat to financial stability and so warrant close surveillance.  The UK-resident sector is dominated by the activities of US securities dealers. While the US Securities and Exchange Commission has recently announced plans to introduce consolidated supervision of the US securities dealers, the current lack of consolidated supervision leaves a need for monitoring of the UK-resident sector over and above reviews of global market robustness. Hedge funds Like other asset managers and life insurers, hedge funds also manage assets on behalf of others.  But, like securities dealers, they typically take greater risks and trade over shorter time horizons – giving them the potential to amplify capital market volatility.  And, by using leverage, hedge funds are more vulnerable to shocks to the market.  This may force them to close out positions quickly, potentially creating market instability if their positions are large relative to the size of the underlying markets. Although there is no hard-and-fast definition of what differentiates a hedge fund from other asset managers, surveys indicate that global hedge funds’ assets under management worldwide are small relative to UK-resident life insurers – managing investments of approximately £480 billion ($870 billion) worldwide in mid-2004.  However, globally active 124 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – Assessing risks from UK non-bank financial sectors 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Government bonds Equities Corporate bonds Asset managers Life insurers Pension funds General insurers Percentage of market Chart 5 Invested assets of UK-resident financial sectors as a proportion of the UK market, end-2002 Sources: ONS, Bank for International Settlements, Debt Management Office and Bank calculations.  hedge funds have been growing rapidly in recent years, with around £45 billion ($80 billion) flowing into hedge funds worldwide in the first half of 2004. And hedge funds’ leverage – which may result from various trading activities, including borrowing, short selling, and derivatives – allows them to take positions that are far larger than their capital subscriptions.  They also usually trade more actively than other asset managers, so they typically account for a much greater proportion of market activity than their assets under management suggest.  And they often take similar positions, and chapter two of the assessment article in the Review routinely discusses the potential for such ‘crowded trades’ to cause disruption in specific global markets. Aside from their investment in international markets, hedge funds also have counterparty links to other financial sectors.  UK-owned banks’ direct exposure to hedge funds is limited.  But hedge funds have growing links to other non-bank financial sectors. Securities dealers are the main providers of ‘prime brokerage’ to hedge funds.1 And an increasing number of life insurers and pension funds are investing in hedge funds, although the sums involved are usually only a small percentage of the investing funds’ total assets. While a significant minority of hedge funds are managed in the United Kingdom, they are active in global (rather than specifically UK) markets and are mainly domiciled in offshore financial centres to take advantage of lower levels of tax and regulation.  As a result, despite their potential relevance to UK financial stability, they largely fall outside the scope of this article. Non-life insurers General insurers General insurers have an important role as providers of insurance to households and corporations (eg employer’s liability insurance).  But, while general insurers have significant links to non-financial corporations and households, risks via the other transmission channels are limited. Most UK banks’ have little exposure to the sector (Chart 3), and the potential for UK-resident general insurers to disrupt capital markets is also limited. The sector’s asset holdings are much smaller than those of life insurers and pension funds, with non-life insurers owning less than 1% of UK equities and 5% of gilts (Chart 5). Some insurers, known as monolines, specialise in writing financial guarantee insurance, such as insuring PFI-backed bonds in the United Kingdom.2 But monolines are mainly US-owned insurers, and much of their business is in the United States, underwriting US municipal debt.  The activity of the UK-resident monolines is relatively limited and unlikely to pose a systemic threat to the UK financial system. The UK-resident reinsurance industry Reinsurers enable life and general insurers to lay off some of the risks they underwrite so risks can be dispersed more widely.  The UK-resident reinsurance industry is dominated by Lloyd’s of London.  In 2003, Lloyd’s underwrote net reinsurance premiums of over £4.3 billion – nearly 60% of the total UK reinsurance market.3 The sector has links to other non-bank financial sectors, particularly other insurers.  For example, UK reinsurers provide reinsurance to life and general insurance sectors. And some UK insurers conduct a limited amount of reinsurance business in the United Kingdom.  The sector also has some involvment in capital markets through its ownership of assets, but the link is limited.  UK reinsurers’ asset holdings are less than a third of UK general insurers’ assets. The UK-resident sector is only part of an international reinsurance industry, where insurers can obtain reinsurance from providers around the globe.  And the UK-resident sector is only a relatively small proportion of the global market:  in 2000, the London Market accounted for less than 10% of global reinsurance premiums written.  But the global industry may have the potential to threaten financial stability through its effects on international capital markets. Assessing risks from UK non-bank financial sectors – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 125 (1) ‘Prime brokerage’ covers a variety of activities, but most commonly refers to lending to hedge funds against a portfolio of securities. (2) Private Finance Initiative:  arrangements where risks associated with public service projects are transferred to the private sector in part or in full in return for a long-term contract to supply services to the public sector. (3) Where institutions, such a Lloyd’s of London, engage in both general and reinsurance business, the assessment of the financial stability risks from the different activities are considered separately.  The general insurance business of Lloyd’s is assessed as part of the assessment of the UK-resident general insurance sector.  Conclusion The most likely sources of risks to UK financial stability in the UK-resident financial system lie in the banking system and in five non-bank sectors: securities dealers, building societies, life insurers and pension funds, ‘other finance providers’ , and general insurers.  The risks arising from these non-bank sectors will be covered in the assessment section of future Reviews when the situation warrants it. 126 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – Assessing risks from UK non-bank financial sectors  Risk appetite:  concept and measurement – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 127 FINANCIAL MARKET practitioners often cite market sentiment as a key factor driving broad trends in asset prices.  The prices of financial assets frequently move together, even though many of the factors affecting valuations in different asset markets can be quite different.  The Asian financial crisis of 1 997 illustrates how shifting perceptions of risk can generate correlation among the prices of seemingly unrelated assets.  Following the devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1 997 , investors reduced their risk  exposures across a range of emerging markets, causing a rise in the cost of borrowing beyond Asia, and into Latin America and Emerging Europe.  The spillover of financial stress across borders could not be explained by trade links and financial interconnections and coincided with claims that a decline in ‘risk appetite’ was an underlying reason for this contagion. The terms ‘risk appetite’ , ‘risk aversion’ and ‘risk premium’ are frequently used interchangeably to refer to sentiment in asset markets.  But the concepts are very distinct and inappropriate use makes it difficult to assess and convey the true extent of the willingness to hold risky assets.  Fundamentally, investors dislike uncertainty about the level of consumption that will be possible in the future given their asset holdings. Risk appetite – the willingness of investors to bear risk – depends on both the degree to which investors dislike such uncertainty and the level of that uncertainty.  The level of uncertainty about consumption prospects depends on the macroeconomic environment.  And the degree to which investors dislike uncertainty reflects underlying preferences.  This risk aversion is part of the intrinsic make-up of the investor.  It is a parameter that our theoretical priors suggest should not change markedly, or frequently, over time. Risk appetite thus reflects somewhat more than the notion of risk aversion in microeconomics.  It shifts periodically as investors respond to episodes of financial distress and macroeconomic uncertainty.  In adverse circumstances, an investor will require higher expected excess returns to bear risk and risk appetite will be low.  Conversely, high risk appetite will be associated with low expected excess returns. The expected excess return required to compensate an investor for holding a risky asset is, in turn, known as the risk premium.  The risk premium is determined partly by the inherent riskiness of the asset, and partly by the level of risk appetite.  The higher the appetite for risk, the lower the risk premium. Figure 1 illustrates how these concepts are linked.

Risk appetite: concept and measurement1 Prasanna Gai and Nicholas Vause, Financial Stability Assessment Division, Bank of England This article critically reviews the analytical underpinning and measurement of investor ‘risk appetite’.  We reconcile a number of different approaches with asset pricing theory, and articulate a new measure based on the variation in the ratio of risk-neutral to subjective probabilities used by investors in evaluating the expected payoff of an asset.  The measure distinguishes risk appetite from risk aversion, and is reported in levels rather than changes.  A preliminary application of the approach is assessed alongside other indicators of market sentiment and appears to yield generally plausible results. Risk premium Riskiness of asset Risk appetite Risk aversion Macroeconomic environment Figure 1 Summary of concepts  This article critically assesses the concept and measurement of risk appetite.  It draws on asset pricing theory to distinguish risk appetite from risk aversion and risk premia.  It then outlines a preferred measure, before contrasting some preliminary calculations based on this method with other indicators of risk appetite advanced in the literature. The concept of risk appetite Textbook treatments of asset pricing theory (eg Cochrane, 2001) state that in an efficient market, with fully rational and informed investors, the current price of an asset, pt, should equal the expected present value of its possible future payoffs, xt+1. These payoffs comprise income (such as dividend payments) received over the horizon, plus the ongoing value of the asset as implied by its future price, pt+1. The payoffs of an asset vary across future states of the world, such as whether a boom or recession develops. The rate at which investors discount in order to relate future purchasing power to present purchasing power varies among states of the world as well.  More formally, the price of an asset can be expressed as [1] where mt+1 denotes the stochastic discount factor that investors use to translate future payoffs in present value terms.  States of the world in which high levels of future consumption are available to investors are states in which future payoffs are discounted at high rates.  This is because asset payoffs are not required to support the level of consumption as much as would otherwise have been the case. The asset pricing relationship described above can be expressed in terms of gross returns,1 Rt+1 , by dividing (1) by current prices.  Thus [2] All assets have the same expected discounted return in equilibrium (of unity), even though different assets generally have different expected returns.  Since both the gross return and the stochastic discount factor are random variables that depend on states of the world, we can write (2) as: [3] If an asset were completely risk free, returns would not vary, and the gross risk-free return would be given by [4] And if investors were neutral towards risk – so that they were indifferent between the particular states of the world in which asset returns were high or low – the rate of return of an asset would not be correlated with the stochastic discount factor.  The covariance term in (3) would then be zero and all assets would offer the same expected rate of return, given by equation (4). In reality, however, investors prefer to receive higher returns in some states than in others.  Most commonly, investors prefer excess returns in those states of the world that deliver low consumption, since the payout in these circumstances is particularly valuable.  An asset that pays a high return in good times when consumption is relatively high, but fails to pay out in bad times, has an unfavourable distribution of payoffs.  In these situations, the stochastic discount factor and asset returns are negatively correlated.  Investors then require a risk premium over and above the risk-free rate to compensate them for holding such an asset. Rearranging (3) and making use of the definition of the risk-free rate in equation (4) allows us to write the risk premium as: [5] The risk premium can, in turn, be decomposed into the quantity of risk associated with each asset, βi, and the unit price of risk, λ, that is common across all assets.  In particular, we can re-write (5) as: [6] E R R m R m m R t t t f t t t t t i t t t f - + + + + + + ( ) - = - ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 cov , var var . b l 1 2 44 4 3 444 1 2 4 4 3 44 E R R R m R t t t f risk premium t f t t t + + + + + ( ) - = - ( ) 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 4 4 3 44 cov , .

This is equal to one plus the net rate of return.  The price of risk is the expected excess return that investors require to hold financial wealth at the margin. We can, therefore, define risk appetite – the willingness of investors to bear risk – as the inverse of the price of risk.  So when investors’ risk appetites fall, they require larger expected excess returns to hold risky assets. It is immediately apparent from equation (6) that the behaviour of risk appetite hinges on the volatility of the stochastic discount factor.  Since the stochastic discount factor specifies the marginal rate at which the investor is willing to substitute uncertain future consumption for present consumption, risk appetite depends on the degree to which investors dislike uncertainty about their future consumption and on factors that determine the overall level of uncertainty surrounding consumption prospects.  Risk aversion reflects the former, since the more risk averse the investor, the more valuable is additional income in bad states of the world relative to good states, as reflected by the curvature of the investor’s utility function.  These are innate preferences over uncertain future prospects.  As such, they are unlikely to vary significantly over time. The factors underpinning risk appetite can be seen more clearly by imposing some structure on the stochastic discount factor.  In particular, if consumption growth is log-normally distributed with variance σ 2 t, and investors have utility functions that depend only on their consumption and capture impatience and aversion to risk, then the price of risk can be expressed as1 [7] where γ is the coefficient of absolute risk aversion.2 So a rise in γ would mean a fall in risk appetite.  But risk appetite will also fall if uncertainty about consumption growth, σt, increases.  The expected volatility of future consumption is likely to depend on factors such as unemployment prospects, the stance of macroeconomic policy, and so on.  So the shifts in market sentiment that are witnessed over time are more likely to be driven by the macroeconomic environment than the risk aversion of investors. The discussion so far has shown how the price of an asset depends on the subjective probabilities assigned by risk-averse investors assign to future payoffs.  The same price may be deduced by treating this risk-averse investor as a risk-neutral investor who attaches increased probability to bad outcomes and reduced probability to good outcomes.  These adjusted probabilities are known as ‘risk-neutral’ probabilities and, importantly, can be readily inferred from the prices of financial options. So we can either try (i) to estimate investors’ best guesses of probabilities in order to compute expected returns, or, equivalently, (ii) consider the behaviour of a typical risk-neutral agent, discount by the risk-free rate, but evaluate the expected payoffs of an asset using a set of adjusted probabilities.  Suppose there are S possible future states of the world, indexed s=1,2,3...S.  The expected discounted return of an asset can be expressed either as the sum of the discounted returns in each state, weighted by investors’ subjective probability of the state occurring, [8] or in terms of adjusted risk-neutral probabilities  π * t+1(s), discounted with the risk-free interest rate, [9] Taken together, equations (8) and (9) imply that the ratio of the risk-neutral to subjective probabilities is proportional to the stochastic discount factor, where the constant of proportionality is given by the gross risk-free rate of return, ie [10] p p t t t t f s s m s R + + + + ( ) ( ) = ( ) 1 1 1 1 * . 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 = ( ) ( ) = ( ) ( ) ( ) + + + + + + = Â E m E R R R s R s s t t t t t f t t t s s p * . 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 = ( ) = ( ) ( ) ( ) + + + + + = Â E m R m s R s s t t t t t t s s p ; l gs t t = , Risk appetite:  concept and measurement – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 129 (1) More specifically, investors have utility functions that are defined over consumption of the form:  u(c) = (c1–γ)/(1–γ).  These utility functions have the convenient property that the composition of consumption is not affected by wealth, but depends only on relative prices. (2) This is a standard result in asset pricing.  For a detailed explanation, see Cochrane (2001), page 1 9.  Asset pricing models that employ these restrictions do, however, significantly underestimate the risk premia observed in practice.  This is due to the low volatility of consumption.  Models with less restrictive utility functions and, hence, stochastic discount factors that depend on a broader set of variables may help to reconcile such anomalies (see, for example, Barberis et al 2001).  Note that the adjusted, risk-neutral probability distribution is pessimistic in the sense that it assigns excessive probability to low-income states and too little probability to high-income states.  The mean of the adjusted (risk-neutral) density is given by equation (4), whereas the mean of the subjective density is given by equation (3).  So the difference between the two means captures the risk premium. The risk aversion of the representative investor also enters the risk-neutral probabilities.  Since risk averse investors value additional income more highly in poor states of the world, low-income states receive an increasing weight when computing the expected return of an asset using the risk-neutral asset pricing relationship.  When the marginal utility of consumption is high in a poor state, s, the adjusted, risk-neutral probability is greater than the subjective probability and vice versa.  Chart 1 provides a stylised illustration of the two probability distributions. An increase in the ratio between the risk-neutral and subjective probabilities may reflect either an increase in risk aversion, or changes in other variables that increase the marginal utility of consumption.  As we have seen, the willingness of the investor to pay for insurance in such states – his risk appetite – depends on the variance of the stochastic discount factor. Since equation (10) provides a measure of that stochastic discount factor across states of the world, it follows from equations (6) and (10) that risk appetite is [1 1] Measures of risk appetite Existing measures of market sentiment fall into two categories, which can both be nested within the conceptual framework outlined above.1 The first, typified by Kumar and Persaud (2002), is based on changes in excess returns.  Equation (6) shows how the expected excess return required by investors to hold an asset depends on the level of risk inherent in the asset and the risk appetite of the investor.  If the level of risk or risk appetite should change, then the required excess return should also change.  The second approach, emphasised by Karampatos et al (2003) and Hayes et al (2003), focuses on a comparison of the risk-neutral and subjective probability densities.  They interpret the ratio of the risk-neutral probability of future returns to subjective probability, evaluated within a certain range, as reflecting risk aversion.2 Kumar and Persaud (2002) propose a measure based on the distribution of excess returns across assets. Their hypothesis is that when appetite for risk increases, excess returns of very risky assets increase by more than for less risky assets.  In contrast, changes in the overall level of risk across all assets should not have a differential impact on expected returns.  So, the degree of correlation between changes in excess returns and the level of risk across a number of assets should indicate any change in the willingness to bear risk. Kumar and Persaud implement this hypothesis by computing Spearman’s rank correlation between the excess returns and volatilities of 17 currencies.3 Excess returns are defined as the difference between actual returns and those implied by futures contracts.

Such measures include the Deutsche Bank Currency Risk Appetite Index, Lehman Brothers’ Risk Aversion Index and JP Morgan’s Liquidity and Credit Premia Index.  Another popular index, the VIX, which is a weighted average of several measures of implied volatility of the US stock market, also falls under this category. (2) See also Scheicher (2003),  Karampatos et al (2003) argue that changes in the composition of investors or the introduction of mechanised trading, such as stop-loss sales, could affect the probability ratio in the same manner as changes in risk aversion.  They therefore suggest that it is interpreted as a measure of effective risk aversion.  Hayes et al note that the ratio measure may also reflect a willingness to provide liquidity to the market.

In other words, [1 3] Combining equations (12) and (1 3), and assuming that asset returns are independently distributed, the changes in excess returns when risk aversion and asset volatility increase are given by the derivatives [1 4] and [1 5] Equation (1 4) shows that an increase in risk aversion will increase expected excess returns according to the volatility of the asset’s return.  This is higher for riskier assets than for less-risky assets.  In contrast, equation (1 5) shows that changes in asset-specific risk will have a uniform effect on expected excess returns, given by the risk aversion parameter.  Both responses are also influenced by the weights of assets in the market portfolio.  But, there is no strong reason to expect a relationship between the riskiness of an asset and its weight in the market portfolio.  So any correlation between excess returns and asset riskiness can be attributed to changes in risk aversion.  The Kumar and Persaud technique therefore detects risk aversion, rather than risk appetite in the sense defined in this paper. Several other issues also need to be borne in mind when interpreting the Kumar and Persaud indicator. First, it indicates changes in risk aversion and does not suggest what its level might be.  Second, the measure does not give an indication of the magnitude of the change in risk aversion.  The rank correlation is theoretically unity when risk aversion is driving returns and zero when changing risk is driving returns.  And, finally, the rank correlation may be non-zero even when risk aversion is constant, if the level of risk associated with different assets changes to differing degrees. Karampatos et al (2003) and Hayes et al (2003) interpret the ratio of the risk-neutral to subjective probabilities on the left-hand side of equation (10) as an indicator of risk aversion.  As we have argued, however, the stochastic discount factor, which features on the right-hand side of equation (10), generally reflects more than just investor preferences. So movements in the probability ratio over time are more likely to reflect factors other than risk aversion. Hayes et al argue that one such factor may be the liquidity of investors’ wealth.  Their hypothesis is that investors discount asset returns less heavily when their wealth is illiquid because it is more difficult to support consumption from retained wealth in such circumstances.  They suggest that the importance of an illiquidity factor in the stochastic discount factor is at its greatest in bad states of the world that are characterised by low asset returns.  This is supported by the fact that, in such states, there is a positive relationship between implied volatilities (which tend to increase when market liquidity falls) and the estimated probability ratio.  In other states of the world, however, a better indication of risk aversion may be obtained, since the liquidity factor is less likely to be important. Jackwerth (2000) also uses the probability ratio to compute risk aversion.  In his model, the representative agent holds the market portfolio.  This means that any state of the world that generates a particular market return also generates a particular discount factor and, hence, a particular risk-neutral probability.  His analysis points to a risk aversion function, across states, of the form [1 6] p p p p ' ' * * s s s s ( ) ( ) = ( ) ( ) , ∂ ( ) - [ ] ∂ = + + E R R t t t f i i 1 1 2 s ga . ∂ ( ) - [ ] ∂ = + + E R R t t t f i i 1 1 2 g s a , R R t m i i t i + + = Â 1 1 a .

See Misina (2003) for a detailed attempt to reconcile the Kumar and Persaud measure with asset pricing theory.  which can be computed from option contracts on the market portfolio. The drawbacks of this approach are twofold.  First, the risk aversion function can take on negative values in some states of the world.  In other words, investors are, on occasion, risk loving.  This stands in contrast to our normal priors, which suggest that investors become more attracted to gambles as their wealth increases rather than less.  Second, a risk aversion schedule does not offer a measure of market sentiment that can readily be tracked over time. Parts of the risk aversion schedule can rise, while others can fall.  So it is difficult to gauge whether risk appetite has increased or not. The discussion so far suggests that a measure of risk appetite based on the variance of the probability ratio (equation 1 1) is appealing, for several reasons.  The measure is more commensurate with investors’ willingness to pay for risk, rather than their aversion to risk.  The focus on the variability of the stochastic discount factor also permits time series estimation in a way that allows changes in the absolute level of risk appetite to be assessed.1 But the measure does rely on statistical methods to model the risk-neutral and subjective densities, and so may suffer from the same problems of measurement error encountered by studies that estimate a ‘ratio’ measure (equation 10).2 In contrast to ‘ratio’ measures, however, the ‘variance’ measure uses estimates of the stochastic discount factor across many different states of the world, in which asset returns differ.  Risk appetite is a summary measure of investors’ attitudes to payoffs across many different states of the world.  By estimating the stochastic discount factor at only one return level, a ‘ratio’ measure could misrepresent investors’ overall attitude to risk.  If the two distributions differ in shape markedly, using all the information in the distributions is likely to offer a more reliable indicator of sentiment. Chart 2 illustrates this point with an example.  A ratio measure evaluated at x would suggest that investors were risk neutral, as the left tails of the risk-neutral and subjective probability densities coincide.  As the densities diverge away from the left tail, however, the variance measure would suggest that investors dislike risk.  As we have seen, risk-neutral distributions assign higher probabilities to lower returns than the subjective beliefs of investors.  But the utility of risk-averse investors is driven to a greater extent by low returns relative to high returns than if they were risk neutral.  As equations (8) and (9) indicate, this is how the two distributions correspond to the same asset and why both distributions imply exactly the same price. Empirical estimates of risk appetite We now consider how various measures of risk appetite perform in practice.  Specifically, we compare a measure of risk appetite computed according to equation (1 1) against a ‘ratio’ measure based on equation (10).  The performance of other measures in accurately gauging market sentiment is also reviewed. The ‘variance’ measure of equation (1 1) and the ratio measure of equation (10) are both computed by estimating probability density functions for future returns – one risk-neutral and one subjective distribution – on the S&P 500 index.  To produce a time series of risk appetite, these distributions are estimated every three months, at the end of each quarter.  As the return forecasts for the end of a particular quarter are made at the end of the previous quarter, the corresponding estimate of risk appetite would also be for the previous quarter. The risk-neutral density function is estimated using three-month option prices (see Breeden and 132 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – Risk appetite:  concept and measurement (1) Froot and O’Connell (2003) present an alternate measure of risk appetite that relies on cross-border portfolio flows.  They obtain an index that compares changes in the risk appetite of cross-border investors with changes in the risk appetite of domestic investors.  But, unlike the measure implied by equation (1 1), it is a relative rather than absolute measure. (2) Note, however, that unlike the ratio measure, the variance-based measure does not distinguish between cases where investors suddenly switch from a ‘normal’ risk-averse state to a risk-loving state – perhaps due to a marked shift in the composition of investors.  Such a situation, however, is extremely unlikely and is not observed in the data. Subjective Risk-neutral Return Density Low income states High income states x Chart 2 Importance of using whole distributions  Litzenberger, 1 978; Clews et al, 2000).  Option prices provide us with a forward-looking guide to the likelihood the market attaches to future values of asset prices.  So by comparing options with different state prices, we can infer the (risk-neutral) probabilities attached by market participants to an asset being within a range of possible prices at some future date.  As equation (9) suggests, this can be done taking the option prices as given and applying a known risk-free rate (such as the US Treasury bill yield) as the discount factor. In order to determine the ‘true’ subjective density function, we need to estimate its overall shape, along with the mean and variance.  We do this by fitting a backward-looking statistical model to historical equity returns and using that model to forecast three months into the future.1 The essential features of the return distribution of equities are fat tails and negative skewness.2 In order to capture these features, we adopt the simplest method possible. Specifically, we model the distribution of equity returns, rt, as an asymmetric GARCH model of the form [17] and [1 8] where a dummy variable, Dt–1, is included in the final term of equation (1 8) to generate negative skewness. Karampatos et al (2003) and Hayes et al (2003) develop more sophisticated GARCH models that relate both the mean and variance of returns to additional financial and economic variables.  But the simple approach outlined here is sufficient to identify key episodes of financial stress and allow consistent comparison across measures.  Details of the GARCH model and the method used to generate the subjective density function are provided in the appendix. Chart 3 illustrates the movement of the variance-based and ratio-based measures during the period 1 990–2004.  The broad similarity of the two measures reflects the similar shapes of the density functions during the period under consideration. Nevertheless, the variance measure is significantly more volatile, moving in a limited range during ‘normal’ times and sharply during episodes of financial stress.  The large spikes during 1 997 Q4 and 1 998 Q3 correspond to the Asian and Russian/LTCM crises.  Another notable shift in risk appetite in 2000 Q1 coincides with the sharp fall in high-tech stock prices.  The pronounced spike in 1 997 Q1 is somewhat harder to explain, however. The variance-based measure also seems to suggest that risk appetite has been above its long-run average value in recent years.  While this appears to be broadly consistent with financial stability surveillance that has pointed to a shift towards more risky investments, the measure should be interpreted cautiously.  For example, it does not detect the notable reduction in the willingness to bear risk identified in the Bank’s December 2002 Review.3 More generally, difficulties in estimating the probability densities mean that the variance-based measure can be disproportionately sensitive to tail probabilities (see appendix). The ratio-based measure identifies the same episodes. But since the measure implied by (10) reflects risk aversion, as opposed to risk appetite, we might expect it to be much less volatile than is the case in Chart 3. It suggests that the ratio-based measure may be reflecting other factors in addition to risk aversion, s w ae ge t t t t D 2 1 2 1 2 1 = + + - - - . r c N t t t t = + ( ) e e s where ~ , 0 2 , Risk appetite:  concept and measurement – Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 133 (1) This assumes no structural change in asset markets, so future asset returns behave in the same way as in the past.

Chart 4 compares the variance measure with the more sophisticated ratio measure of Karampatos et al (2003).  It is immediately apparent that the Karampatos et al measure looks quite different from the ratio-based and variance-based measures from our illustrative GARCH.  So variations in the construction of the risk-neutral and subjective densities make an important difference to estimates of risk appetite and risk aversion. The Karampatos et al measure suggests that investor sentiment deteriorated sharply at the time of the Asian and Russian crises.  It also appears to pick up the withdrawal from risk since the peak of the equity markets in 2000 reported in various financial stability reports.  While the measure has pointed to a marked increase in risk appetite since 2003 Q1, some of this appears to have unwound on the most recent data. By contrast, our simple variance measure suggests that recent appetite for risk has been high but relatively stable.  It is difficult to compare any further across indicators since the true subjective probability density of investors is unknown. Chart 5 plots the variance measure against rank correlation between excess return and risk proposed by Kumar and Persaud.  Excess returns are computed as actual returns minus the return implied by forward rates.  And risk is taken to be the standard deviation of these excess returns over the preceding year. The Kumar and Persaud measure is more volatile than either the variance-based or ratio measures, and it is unclear whether either investors’ risk appetite or risk aversion should fluctuate to such an extent.  A priori, risk appetite is unlikely to change much during normal periods, but can be expected to shift markedly during financial crises.  As discussed above, the measure is likely to reflect changing risk aversion, rather than its level.  Chart 5 suggests risk aversion increased sharply in 1 995 Q1, with the Mexican crisis, but also in 2000 Q3, which is more difficult to explain.  And there appear to have been notable declines in investor sentiment during 1 995 Q2 and 2000 Q4.  The events to which these movements correspond are not readily evident. Chart 6 compares the variance-based measure from the simple GARCH model (used in the previous charts) against an alternative GARCH model that estimates subjective probabilities along the lines adopted by Hayes et al.  In particular, dividend yields are used to help estimate mean returns in equation (17) and the spread between BAA- and AAA-rated corporate bonds is used to help estimate the variance of returns in equation (1 8).  These variables might be helpful in modelling the distribution of returns as the former is a component of gross returns, while yield spreads and equity returns generally move together as they are both determined by the value of corporate assets. The additional variables identified by Hayes et al are found to be statistically significant in helping to explain the statistical distribution of past returns. This suggests that there is scope for improving the measurement of subjective probabilities.  Although we do not report details of the modified GARCH equation here, the similar profiles of risk appetite in Chart 6 suggest that the simple model used for illustration in this paper is reasonably robust. 134 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – Risk appetite:  concept and measurement 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 1990 92 94 96 98 2000 02 04 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 Variance measure (right-hand scale) Karampatos et al (left-hand scale) High risk appetite Low risk aversion Chart 4 Variance-based measure and the Karampatos et al indicator(a) Sources:  Bank of England and BIS.

Conclusion This article has reviewed the notion of risk appetite in theory and in practice.  Unlike existing measures, our approach provides an indicator of market sentiment that is distinct from risk aversion and focuses on levels rather than changes.  A further feature of the measure is that it uses all the information in the risk-neutral and subjective probability distributions. This may make it a better gauge of risk appetite. The preliminary empirical analysis reported here suggests that measures of risk appetite based on this approach seem plausible.  But it should be stressed that our findings are a tentative first step in the measurement of perceptions of risk across time.  The role of market liquidity and changes in the composition of investors in influencing risk appetite merits further investigation.  Further work is also needed to develop better estimates of investors’ subjective probabilities over states of the world, and to relate better the mean and variance of asset returns to financial and economic variables. Appendix The parameter values of the GARCH model were estimated using quarterly data from 1 928–89 (Table 1).  The positive value of α implies that large deviations from the average return are more likely to follow previous large deviations.  This generates volatility clustering and, hence, fat tails.  A positive value for γ generates negative skewness, as Dt–1 is an indicator variable that equals 1 when the previous quarter’s return was below average and otherwise equals 0. Three steps are required to generate a subjective density function of three-month future returns using this model.  First, the shape of this distribution is given by the actual distribution (rather than the assumed Normal distribution) of the standardised residuals, εt/σt, from equation (17).  Second, this distribution is scaled by a forecast of the conditional volatility obtained by rolling equation (1 8) forward by one quarter, ie [1 9] Finally, the distribution is shifted, so that its mean is equal to the mean of the risk-neutral distribution plus a risk premium.  The estimated mean from equation (1 8) is disregarded as this is a very simple equation, which is unlikely to forecast accurately. The GARCH model was employed principally for the volatility forecast used in step 2.  The equity risk premium was taken as the residual from a Dividend Discount Model of the S&P index level estimated by Panigirtzoglou and Scammell (2002). The construction of the subjective density forecast is illustrated in Charts 7 and 8. In Chart 7 , the standardised residuals from equation (17) are multiplied by the square-root of the variance forecast of equation (1 9), evaluated at a particular point in time.  This has the effect of scaling the distribution of the standardised residuals, as illustrated. s w ae ge bs t t t t t D + - = + + + 1 2 2 2 1 2 .

In Chart 8 the estimated subjective distribution (the scaled standardised residuals) is shifted.  The estimated mean is disregarded and substituted for the mean of the risk-neutral distribution plus the equity risk premium from the dividend discount model.  This shift moves the estimated subjective distribution from the dotted pink distribution to the solid pink distribution. Computing the variance-based and ratio-based measures is then a simple matter of employing equations (10) and (1 1).1 Three-month US Treasury bill yields are used as a proxy for the risk-free rate in equation (1 1). 136 Financial Stability Review:  December 2004 – Risk appetite:  concept and measurement Shift mean Return Density Rf + premium Chart 8 Correction of the mean of the subjective return density (1) Since errors in estimating both the risk-neutral and subjective probability densities can have disproportionate effects in the tails, the variance measure is computed across a wide range of returns.  More specifically, we compute our simple measure from two standard deviations below the mean of the risk-neutral distribution to two standard deviations above it.  While this may appear arbitrary, it has the benefit of capturing around 95% of probability mass in these densities.

Hence there is a potential role for policymakers in influencing incentives appropriately and in some cases constraining private actions.  The Bank’s regular article Strengthening financial infrastructure considers two exercises designed to ensure that some of the risks faced by firms are managed in such a way that they do not give rise to an unacceptable level of systemic risk.  First, it reports on the proposals of the Basel/IOSCO Trading Book Review, which are currently being finalised after a period of consultation.  An important aspect of the proposals is that capital standards should take into account the liquidity of financial markets used by banks to transfer risk.  Second, the article looks at the management of risks in payment systems.  As a practical example, it describes the agreement put in place earlier this year by the Bank, the payments industry association APACS and the member banks of the United Kingdom’s major retail payments systems, to reduce spillover risks that could arise in the event of the default of a member of these systems.  This agreement required  co-operation between the banks and the payments industry, the Bank of England and the FSA to ensure that the agreement was supported by prudential rules. Another way in which the authorities can contribute to the maintenance of financial stability is by strengthening the framework for restructuring sovereign debts.  The article by PaulBedford, AdrianPenalver and Chris Salmon, Resolving sovereign debt crises:  the market-based approach and the role of the IMF, notes that, historically, sovereign debt crises have often entailed protracted and costly debt restructuring negotiations. As such crises are not unusual, it is important to address these Financial stability themes and issues — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 3 Financial stability themes and issues Since last December’s Review, the short-run outlook for the stability of the UK financial system has remained good. The major UK banks, and the borrowers and other counterparties to which they are exposed, have not in general shown any signs of financial fragility.  However, the ‘search for yield’ has been continuing and longer-term vulnerabilities may be building because of the still rapid growth in some borrowers’ and financial institutions’ balance sheets.  The threats facing the UK financial system are discussed in the Bank of England’s regular assessment of the Financial stability conjuncture and outlook.  difficulties.  The authors argue that, despite some helpful recent developments, there remains scope both to strengthen  market-based mechanisms for resolving crises and to improve the clarity of IMF policies. One of the market-based mechanisms that can help to mitigate systemic risk is the appropriate design of sovereign bond contracts.  The Bank of England hosted a workshop in January 2005, reported here by PaulBedford, to facilitate discussion among market participants.  The workshop explored innovations that, in principle, might help to improve the effectiveness of the debt restructuring process.  Three specific innovations were considered at some length:  engagement provisions;  the appointment of bondholder trustees;  and aggregation clauses. Contract design ought to take into account the possibility that debtors may default and the fact that some desirable financial markets and instruments are missing, so full private insurance arrangements to eliminate financial fragility are impossible. Ideally, such issues would be analysed together in a single coherent model.  In A model to analyse financial fragility, Charles Goodhart and Lea Zicchino sketch a framework for such an approach to the analysis of financial stability, drawing on recent research at the Bank and forming part of a wider effort to develop the theoretical analysis of financial stability.  In contrast to many previous models, it includes features that are essential if the possibilities of contagion and feedback effects are to be examined:  banks and firms can default, there are incomplete markets and agents differ in their characteristics.  The framework generates some complex models but, nevertheless, these can be calibrated empirically (if imprecisely) to examine the welfare consequences of a range of possible policy measures, such as capital adequacy requirements.  One advantage of this approach is that it holds out the hope of deriving an empirical measure of financial fragility. The Goodhart and Zicchino approach is helpful when assessing the likely long-run impact of changes in key parameters and policies on risks to financial stability, as it takes into account general equilibrium feedbacks.  To achieve that goal while maintaining the model’s tractability requires some strong simplifying assumptions.  In assessing how robust real financial systems are likely to be in the face of shocks, it is helpful also to use approaches that accommodate a richer empirical data set and are more amenable to statistical estimation, even though they may not capture all the second-round effects of the shocks. In Stress testing as a tool for assessing systemic risks, Philip Bunn, Alastair Cunningham and Mathias Drehmann set out the current stress-testing framework used in this spirit in the Bank of England to assess the degree of credit risk;  this can be seen as complementary to the Goodhart-Zicchino approach.  As an example, the article updates the analysis of the shocks 4 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — Financial stability themes and issues Financial stability themes and issues Financial Stability Review June 2005  considered in the 2002 UK Financial Stability Assessment Programme exercise with the FSA and IMF;  the results are reassuring and consistent with the qualitative judgements made in this issue’s review of the Financial stability conjuncture and outlook.  The authors also discuss some of the challenges associated with stress testing.  Stress events are rare, which makes calibration of such circumstances difficult, particularly if the relationships between variables are non-linear and if there are structural breaks.  But the stress-testing framework can be used to assess the importance of these challenges.  The article  is part of the Bank’s wider strategy to communicate its  stress-testing work and highlight some key issues for market participants, which complements the work being undertaken with firms by the FSA. Stress-testing generally uses hypothetical ‘shock scenarios’.  But it is also possible to examine the impact of historical events. This is the approach taken by Marco Stringa and Allan Monks in their investigation Inter-industry linkages between UK life insurers and UK banks:  an event study, which considers the impact of six events that affected life insurers’ equity prices in 2001–03.  They find that adverse events did not spill over to have a significant impact on the UK banking sector as a whole, but so-called bancassurers’ equity prices were affected to some degree, possibly as a consequence of their direct ownership of life insurance subsidiaries. The articles in this issue of the Financial Stability Review variously consider how to think about financial stability, threats to financial stability and measures to reduce those threats.  The Bank of England, alongside the FSA and HM Treasury, is also heavily involved in ensuring that, in the unlikely event of a financial crisis occurring, it can be resolved quickly and effectively.  These are all important aspects of a central bank’s work, as Sir Andrew Large explains in A framework for financial stability, a speech reprinted in this Review.  Sir Andrew makes the point that central banks need to be clear, accountable and transparent as to the reasons for devoting resources to financial stability work.  He articulates a set of general organising principles for such work, acknowledging that — as in the United Kingdom — responsibility for this public policy objective is often shared with regulators and the finance ministry.  And he draws attention to some of the reasons why making such a framework operational is challenging — not least because of the increasing complexity of financial systems.  But it is important that the challenge be taken up, given the potential costs to economies of failure.

The large UK-owned banks made fewer new provisions against bad debt last year than the year before  (Chart 1);  corporate default rates around the world are still low; ratings upgrades have outnumbered downgrades since the December Review;  and volatility in international financial markets has been muted for most of the time.  Unlike in the previous six months, there have, however, been a few signs of a reassessment of credit quality:  bond spreads — especially at the high-yield end of the credit spectrum (Chart 2) — and credit default swap (CDS) premia have risen around the world since March, and market participants have been willing to pay a little more for protection against bank defaults.  Write-offs on UK household debt have increased.  But, overall, the outlook suggests that major threats to financial institutions from developments in the economic environment are unlikely to materialise in the short term. Nevertheless, financial stability authorities need to consider whether financial markets and institutions are robust enough if unlikely downside risks do crystallise.  In the current conjuncture, with the ‘search for yield’ highlighted in previous Reviews apparently continuing, the question arises as to whether markets are underpricing risk and lenders underestimating the possibility of defaults.  If that were so, it would encourage overborrowing, raising the vulnerability of borrowers and hence lenders to adverse shocks.  And a reassessment of risk by market participants could lead to abrupt asset price changes. Credit default risk Past Reviews have noted how longer-term vulnerabilities may have increased, given continuing rapid lending growth by the major UK banks (Chart 3);  high and rising debt-to-income ratios for households in the United Kingdom and several other countries; and historically high levels of UK corporate debt.  This issue remains. Domestically, the vulnerabilities are most evident in unsecured lending to UK households, which accounts for the largest The financial stability conjuncture and outlook — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 9 The financial stability conjuncture and outlook An overview of UK financial stability: threats and resilience 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 1 988 90 92 94 96 98 2000 02 04 Interquartile range Median Per cent Chart 1 Large UK-owned banks’ new provisions for bad and doubtful debts(a) Sources: Thomson Financial Datastream, published accounts and Bank calculations.

The write-off rate on household lending is still low by historical standards.  The sharp rise in personal insolvencies — on an annual basis, they are now some 30% above their early 1 990s peak — very likely exaggerates the deterioration in the creditworthiness of households in general.  However, the  write-off rate increased quite sharply in the second half of last year (Chart 4), wholly because of losses on unsecured lending — on credit cards and via other channels.  It seems unlikely that this rise was fully anticipated by lenders in their pricing, and some lenders report that they have started to tighten credit standards.  Losses on mortgages have remained very low, although mortgage arrears have ticked up a little. One challenge for banks is that a significant proportion of UK households borrow from more than one lender, so that their creditors do not have a full picture of their financial burden. Hence the efforts of the British Bankers’ Association to promote data sharing, to allow improved assessments of borrowers’ debt-servicing capacity, are welcome. While the personal insolvency rate in the United Kingdom has been rising, the UK corporate insolvency rate has fallen to its lowest level for 25 years.  But there have been some signs of a turning point recently:  sterling bond spreads have risen since March, profit warnings (Chart 5) have become more frequent and Consensus forecasts suggest that profits growth is likely to slow.  Capital gearing remains higher than past statistical relationships would have suggested, and firms in general are showing little inclination to reduce their leverage. Borrowing by the UK commercial property sector has been increasing significantly.  The annual growth rate of lending to the sector, at nearly 20% in 2005 Q1, has remained rapid, and the sector now accounts for over a third of the major UK banks’ outstanding lending to UK-resident non-financial companies (Chart 6).  And there may be substantial indirect exposures: much lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (a fifth of corporate lending) is collateralised by property.  As with corporate lending generally, write-off rates have been very low recently.  But there is a possibility that expectations of rental growth are optimistic.  A recent survey by the Investment Property Forum suggested that nominal rental values were expected to increase by nearly 3% per year over the next five years;  yet over the past 20 years, they have increased less rapidly than the general price level. Risks in the international financial system The higher-than-expected gearing of UK firms reflects in part a more widespread phenomenon, the ‘search for yield’ by investors that has helped to compress borrowing spreads globally.  In the first part of the period under review, there was some evidence of 10 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — The financial stability conjuncture and outlook 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 1998 99 2000 01 02 03 04 Per cent Chart 3 Annual growth in major UK banks’ credit exposures(a) Source:  Published accounts.

Syndicated loan origination — in which some major UK-owned banks are active — was close to the record levels of 2004;  spreads in that market were lower, too, and there were reports of covenants and collateral requirements being loosened and leverage increasing.  However, from around mid-March, bond spreads and CDS premia started to increase.  Although much of the rise since mid-March has subsequently unwound, spreads generally remain a little above the level at the time of the previous Review (Chart 7). Given the continuing low level of medium to long-term interest rates on assets without default risk (despite increases in US official short-term rates in the period), many investors have continued to seek out higher returns, accepting higher risks in the process.  The systemic risk is two-fold:  first, risk may be being underpriced, giving rise to the danger of a sharp movement in asset prices in the event of some trigger such as a major credit default;  second, even if risks are being appropriately priced given the current outlook, financial market participants have taken on relatively illiquid assets to enhance yield, possibly giving rise to difficulties in adjusting balance sheets if the outlook changes.  In both cases, risk management by firms is unlikely to take fully into account the spillover and contagion risks to other market participants, which are potentially large in the event of a major firm facing liquidity or solvency problems.  Such events seem unlikely — judging by market indicators such as CDS premia — but their costs if financial intermediation is disrupted could be considerable. The profit warning from General Motors (GM) in March and subsequent rating downgrades of GM and Ford provided a good example of how in the current environment the crystallisation of risk can have unexpected effects, as argued in the December 2004 Review.  Perceived default risk spiked (Chart 8).  Some hedge funds and trading desks of large complex financial institutions (LCFIs) are reported to have made significant losses, because the developments triggered unexpected relative movements in bond and equity prices, with spillovers to the rapidly growing structured credit market and the high-yield corporate bond market.  Some participants reportedly found it difficult to close out positions in some ‘crowded trades’ because liquidity was scarce when they needed it.  And some faced challenges in valuing positions. Whether all the consequences of this episode have yet worked their way through fully remains to be seen.  There does not appear to have been contagion to the high-yield emerging-market asset class or to investment-grade bonds.  It may have helped that increasing use of credit risk transfer markets has facilitated the dispersion of firm-specific credit risk.

But many hedge funds have reportedly been paying particular attention to managing the liquidity of their liabilities and positioning themselves to cope if withdrawals were to increase markedly.  CDS premia (Chart 9) rose more for those LCFIs believed to be more involved in prime brokerage and structured credit markets, although the movements were small by historical standards.  The experience emphasises the value of extensive stress-testing by financial firms, avoiding excessive reliance on models calibrated over short periods. UK financial sector resilience Some major UK banks have increased their overseas business and capital market activity rapidly, partly by means of acquisitions (notably in the United States).  The major UK banks have also continued to increase their borrowing — from other banks and in international capital markets — to fill the ‘customer funding gap’ between customer deposits and more rapidly expanding customer loans (Chart 10).  Hence the interaction of the major UK banks, as a group, with the international financial system has been increasing recently.  The reliance of some UK banks on wholesale funding has in the past caused a degree of concern on the part of rating agencies and others.  Wholesale funding could prove difficult and costly to roll over at a time of firm-specific or market-wide stress.  However, major UK banks’ reported sterling liquidity exceeds regulatory minima (Chart 1 1).  Some banks have been developing liquidity ‘stress testing’ to assess how assets and liabilities might behave in extreme scenarios, although, in general, they do not publicly disclose the results. Banks’ stress testing of extreme shocks to credit quality has been evolving, and is apparently more advanced than similar work on liquidity.  It is also possible to carry out stress tests for the UK banking system as a whole using aggregate data (see Bunn, Cunningham and Drehmann (2005), pages 1 1 6–26 of this Review).  These suggest that the major UK banks would remain profitable in the stress scenarios considered.  The median return on assets among the major UK banks has remained high, rising further in 2004, as both provisions and cost-income ratios tended to fall.  But, in the light of the changing outlook for credit risk and the low absolute level of provisions, the likelihood of further falls in provisions continuing to enhance profitability seems limited.  As a result, some banks have been seeking to diversify their activities — increasing their income from insurance, dealing profits, fees and commissions, for example — and this may help support profits in the event of a rise in credit losses.  The major UK banks’ median Tier 1 capital ratio remained above 8% last year (Chart 12) — substantially above the regulatory minimum of 4% set by the Basel framework for internationally active banks. Private financial firms cannot be expected voluntarily to consider the consequences of all the spillovers from their own actions, so 12 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — The financial stability conjuncture and outlook 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 1 40 1 60 1 80 2001 02 03 04 05 Maximum-minimum range Interquartile range Median Basis points Chart 9 Price of LCFI default protection(a) Sources:  Markit and Bank calculations.

Public authorities can, in principle, design regulation to encourage firms to address these systemic risks.  The article Strengthening financial infrastructure considers the Basel/IOSCO Trading Book Review (TBR), which is currently being finalised after a period of consultation.  It provides a practical example of how regulation can be designed to enhance systemic stability. The risk of financial instability can also be reduced by designing payment and settlement infrastructure so that it does not act as a potential channel for difficulties to spread from one institution to another, and can continue to operate should a member institution be unable to meet its obligations.  Strengthening financial infrastructure also reports on the implementation earlier this year of arrangements which reduce risk associated with the United Kingdom’s major retail payment systems, BACS and the Cheque & Credit Clearings.  The Bank, working with the member banks of these clearings, the payments industry association APACS and the FSA, has put in place arrangements for members to fund possible shortfalls that would otherwise prevent settlement in these systems from completing in the event of a member’s default.

The demand for credit has moderated somewhat, with the annual growth rates of both secured and unsecured lending slowing, in line with the outlook for economic activity and the housing market.  Perceptions of the likelihood of default appear to be changing.  Some lenders have begun to tighten credit standards on unsecured lending and are reviewing measures of affordability on new mortgages. Market participants also seem to be reassessing the probability of corporate default, following the recent downgradings in the US auto industry.  The growth in profits of UK firms has shown signs of slowing and profit warnings among quoted firms have risen.  However, corporate default and write-off rates in the United Kingdom remain at low levels. The outlook for credit risk is likely to remain favourable in the short term, reflecting prospects for economic activity around the world.  But the high levels of indebtedness of households and firms continue to point to medium-term vulnerabilities.  Unexpected periods of economic strain could precipitate tighter credit conditions and repayment problems.  In particular: G losses on unsecured lending are likely to rise sharply during times of stress.  So the continued build-up of unsecured debt poses challenges for borrowers and lenders in the event of a significant adverse shock to incomes; G the relatively high level of gearing leaves the corporate sector vulnerable to any sharper-than-expected slowdown in activity.  Any financial pressures are likely to be exacerbated by the growing prominence of private equity transactions (see Box 3).  And investors’ desire to increase their exposure to the commercial property sector further could trigger problems should rental growth expectations prove over-optimistic;  and G there are sizable exposures overseas (see Box 6) — in particular, to households and firms in the United States, to banks in Europe and to residential property in Hong Kong.  Immediate risks from these credit exposures remain small, although some borrowers’ balance sheets may be vulnerable to further rises in oil prices and sharp falls in property prices.  Unexpectedly sharp rises in US interest rates, or an abrupt slowdown in economic activity in China, could also adversely affect these exposures. The UK financial system remains well placed in the face of these near and medium-term risks.  Although unsecured lending is a small part of UK-owned banks’ lending activities, the recent acceleration of write-off rates on lending to households is unlikely to have been fully anticipated by banks.  The risks of default on mortgage portfolios and commercial property lending have also risen somewhat, but potential losses appear likely to be contained.  And the likelihood of default on the overseas exposures of the main UK-owned banks is moderate, although the slight deterioration in the global financial environment since December points to the need for vigilance.  1  Credit risk Introduction The credit exposures of the major UK banks — a group defined in Box 1(1) — have been rising rapidly over the past few years  (Chart 1.1).  Total losses remained a small percentage of outstanding loans (Chart 1.2).  While the majority of credit exposures in 2004 were to UK residents (Chart 1.3), losses arose mainly from overseas lending. The low level of losses reflected the favourable macroeconomic environment in the United Kingdom and in some of the key overseas markets of UK banks, such as the United States, in the second half of last year, although growth was relatively sluggish in the euro area.  The impact on borrowers of the increases in short-term interest rates in the United Kingdom and United States in response to prospective inflationary pressures was outweighed by the impact of lower longer-term rates and robust economic growth. The outlook for the major macroeconomic factors influencing credit risk is broadly benign.  According to the May 2005 Inflation Report, UK output growth is expected to remain close to trend over the next three years.  However, there are downside risks, relative to the central projection, arising from uncertainty over the strength of domestic consumption, the impact of oil prices and economic recovery in the euro area.(2) The latest Consensus forecasts still project a robust expansion for the US economy this year, but the near-term outlook for the euro area has weakened compared with six months ago (Chart 1.4). Forward contracts suggest that market participants expect, in the near term, further monetary tightening in the United States, but not in the United Kingdom.  Longer-term interest rates, such as ten-year government bond yields, in the United Kingdom, United States and the euro area are currently lower than six months ago.    Recent changes in market indicators suggest that there may have been a turnaround in perceptions of corporate credit risk.  Since the December 2004 Review, bond spreads have tended to widen somewhat, with the widening more marked for global high-yield corporate debt than for investment-grade corporate debt. However, the widening of spreads so far has been much less pronounced than that during the period of global stresses in autumn 1 998 or following the defaults of Enron (2001) and WorldCom (2002) (Chart 1.5).  The recent widening could be linked to a number of factors, including some softer global macroeconomic data and developments in the finances of the US The financial stability conjuncture and outlook — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 15 (1) As discussed in Box 1, membership in the ‘major UK banks’ peer group is based on the provision of banking-type services in the United Kingdom.

There may also have been some fall in investors’ risk appetite.  However, bond spreads remain low by the standards of the past seven years.  Credit default swap premia are also low at present. Other indicators also suggest that debtor default risk has been muted.  Twelve-month global corporate default rates, which were already at less than 1% at the time of the December 2004 Review, have declined further since then.  The number of rating upgrades continued to rise and the number of rating downgrades to fall, so that the former outweighed the latter in 2005 Q1. World equity indices, on the whole, have increased slightly since the previous Review, with the largest increases for the oil and gas sectors, which have benefited from the oil price shock, and for the pharmaceutical sector (Chart 1.6).  Uncertainty about corporate prospects has generally declined over the period, judging by expected equity index volatility implied by options prices. The sharp increase in oil prices over the past year is likely to have worsened the terms of trade of net oil-importing countries and put pressure on some corporate borrowers.  Options on oil futures suggest that oil prices will remain high in the next twelve months, above the level expected at the time of the December 2004 Review. Another risk to the UK financial system is a disorderly adjustment of global imbalances.  Over the past year, many large Asian EMEs have had large current account surpluses compared with the averages in the previous five years.  At the same time, the United States has had a current account deficit equivalent to around 6% of GDP .  That raises the likelihood of adjustments in exchange rates, reinforcing uncertainty about the stability of global capital flows.  Such adjustments in exchange rates need not be abrupt, but could, in some circumstances, lead to a sharp loss of export competitiveness or rises in interest rates, or both, in some countries.  If that were to happen, the downside risk to the debt-servicing capacity of some borrowers from UK banks and from the counterparties of UK banks would increase.  And asset price volatility would heighten market risk.  The remainder of this chapter discusses further the main factors that could affect the debtor default risk facing the major UK banks. 16 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — The financial stability conjuncture and outlook 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 2003 04 05 United States 2004 United States 2005 United States 2006 Euro area 2004 Euro area 2005 Euro area 2006 Per cent Chart 1.4 Real GDP forecasts, 2004 to 2006(a)(b) Source:  Consensus Economics Inc.

(c) Dec. 2004 Review.  1.1  UK household sector credit risks Major UK banks’ lending to domestic households comprised about 25% of their total assets at the end of 2004, and is the single largest component of their global balance sheet.  This share was a little lower than a year earlier (because of new acquisitions overseas) but was broadly in line with the average over the past few years.  This section considers the nature of these exposures;  the recent increase in household insolvencies and write-offs;  and factors that influence the outlook for credit risk. Exposures of the major UK banks Over 80% of the major UK banks’ household exposures are secured on property (Chart 1.7).  The annual growth rate of this lending has slowed a little since the previous Review (Chart 1.8), but the quarterly growth rate has stabilised in recent months, in line with the fall and then stabilisation in housing market activity (May Inflation Report, page 5).  As buy-to-let lending  has continued to grow faster than lending to owner-occupiers, it has accounted for an increasing proportion of secured household lending, but still makes up only around 6% of the stock. The annual growth rate for unsecured lending remains higher than that for secured, and has averaged over 1 5% since the  late 1 990s (Chart 1.8).  Despite this growth, unsecured lending still makes up less than a sixth of the major UK banks’ exposures to households (Chart 1.7).  However, it accounts for over 90% of write-offs (Chart 1.9).  Moreover, losses on unsecured lending tend to be more volatile, and Bank of England stress-testing work has suggested that, in times of stress, losses on unsecured lending are likely to rise more sharply than write-offs on secured lending.  Exposures could also increase rapidly were borrowers to draw down on available credit (such as overdraft and credit card facilities) in times of financial strain.  Undrawn facilities for credit card lending, at roughly three times drawn borrowing, are particularly significant.  But these risks can be reduced by lenders, as discussed later in the chapter. Insolvencies and write-offs Despite the favourable macroeconomic environment, personal insolvencies rose further in the first quarter of 2005  (Chart 1.10).  They are now about 30% above their early 1 990s annual peak, probably because unsecured debt per household is higher, although households may also be more aware of their bankruptcy option (Box 2).  Nevertheless, insolvency remains a rare event, affecting only about one person in a thousand each year, and the insolvency rate for England and Wales is less than a fifth that in the United States.

In November 2004, Abbey, the sixth largest  UK-owned bank by total assets, was taken over by Banco Santander, a foreign-owned bank.  This takeover prompted a review of the membership of the peer group analysed in the Review. Membership Membership in the new ‘major domestic monetary financial institutions’ peer group is based on the provision of banking-type services in the United Kingdom, regardless of the country of ownership, and regardless of the legal definition of the intermediary — bank, building society or other finance provider. For convenience, the peer group will be referred to as ‘major UK banks’ throughout the Review.(1) Inclusion in the group will be reviewed over time and revised if necessary to ensure that membership reflects developments in the UK financial landscape, including mergers and acquisition. While limiting membership to ten financial groups at any one time is arbitrary, most relevant activity is captured, given the concentrated nature of most of the main banking services in the United Kingdom (Chart A). Risks and resilience While membership is based on the provision of banking-type services in the United Kingdom, foreign assets make up a material proportion of major UK banks’ total global assets (Chart B).  As a result, they are exposed to risks from their operations both in the United Kingdom and abroad, as discussed in Chapters 1 and 2 of this Review. The ability of major UK banks to absorb these risks depends not only on the robustness of their UK operations but also on their strength on a global, consolidated basis.  Hence, Chapter 3 of the Review assesses their resilience by analysing profitability, capitalisation, liquidity and links with other members of the group, at a global level.  As before, smaller UK-resident banks and building societies will also continue to be monitored,(2) while large complex financial institutions active in global markets are analysed in Chapter 2. Box 1:  The major UK banks (1) The following financial groups, in alphabetical order, are currently members of the major UK banks’ peer group:  Alliance & Leicester, Banco Santander, Barclays, Bradford & Bingley, HBOS, HSBC, Lloyds TSB, Nationwide, Northern Rock and RBS.

The financial stability conjuncture and outlook — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 19 Personal insolvencies in England and Wales have increased sharply over the past five years and reached 49,500 in the year to April 2005, a 3 1% increase on the year to April 2004.  This Box considers explanations for this trend. The rise in insolvencies has been concentrated among employees and those with no occupation or who are unemployed.  Since 1 999, bankruptcies among the self-employed, which are likely to be more directly affected by corporate conditions, have been broadly stable (Chart A), but bankruptcies among employees have increased by 1 45% and those among the unemployed and those with no occupation have tripled.  This has coincided with a rapid increase in unsecured borrowing (Chart 1.8).  Since the  mid-1 990s, that has been associated with higher borrowing per indebted household, rather than an increase in the number of households with unsecured debt.(1) These higher levels of debt have increased the vulnerability of households to income shocks and hence the probability of individuals pursuing insolvency procedures if such a shock materialises.  This increased vulnerability may have been more marked for renters with unsecured debt because, as discussed on page 22, homeowners have been cushioned by increases in their housing equity. While it may be too soon to evaluate their impact fully, changes to bankruptcy legislation introduced last year in England and Wales seem unlikely to have had a large influence on the rise in insolvencies.  The upward trend in insolvencies was established well before the change in legislation and, as discussed in the December 2004 issue of the Review, the effect of the legal changes on borrowers’ incentives seems likely to be slight. Some lenders have expressed concern that the increase in bankruptcies could be symptomatic of a reduced commitment to repay debt, particularly among younger people.  This would be consistent with the sharp increase in debtor bankruptcy petitions over the past year (Chart B).  And it is likely that the rise in insolvencies does reflect greater awareness of the options available to distressed households.  The increase in calls to debt advice agencies and the number of new debt management plans are also evidence of this (Chart C).  But contacts in the debt advice sector report that many people are still unwilling to consider bankruptcy.

The write-off rate on UK-owned banks’ household lending has also increased in recent years, particularly in recent quarters.(1) But the rise has been less pronounced than that for personal insolvencies, and the rate remains well below its early-1 990s peak.(2) The increase has been smaller partly because the average debt of bankrupts has fallen slightly over the past three years, despite the overall growth of borrowing.(3) And lenders’ recovery rates may also have risen, as Income Payment Orders and Agreements were used in almost 20% of bankruptcy cases in 2004, about twice as often as in previous years. During 2004, credit card exposures accounted for over 30% of UK-owned banks’ write-offs on their domestic household lending (Chart 1.1 1).  This proportion has trebled since 1 998, reflecting both the sharper rise in the credit card write-off rate  (Chart 1.12) and the growing stock of such lending.  As discussed in some banks’ recent trading statements, the scale of the increase has surprised some lenders.  But credit card business generally remains profitable;  the effective interest rate on credit card lending is currently around 1 1 percentage points above the cost of banks’ funds. Although accounting for the majority of UK-owned banks’ exposures to the UK household sector, mortgage lending made up less than 1% of write-offs in 2004.  Arrears on this lending also remain near historical lows and provisions are about a tenth of the level reported during the early 1 990s.  But market contacts have argued that provisions are unlikely to fall much further and the proportion of mortgages that were three to six months in arrears ticked-up in the second half of 2004 (Chart 1.1 3).  The increase is, however, small relative to previous changes and is not yet conclusive evidence of a change in the trend.  Buy-to-let loans have also shown a slight rise in arrears, but again from a very low level. Financial pressures on households Growth of debt The rapid increase in households’ borrowing has raised total debt to close to 1 50% of annualised aggregate post-tax income  (Chart 1.1 4).  As discussed in the December Review, debt may continue to increase more rapidly than income over the next few years.  Mortgage debt is likely to continue to adjust gradually to the increase in the ratio of house prices relative to earnings over the past few years, at a pace dependent on housing market 20 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — The financial stability conjuncture and outlook 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1 988 90 92 94 96 98 2000 02 04 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.1 4 Insolvency rate (left-hand scale)(c) Per cent Per cent Write-off rate (right-hand scale)(a)(b) Chart 1.10 Household write-off and insolvency rates Sources:  ONS, DTI and Bank of England.

See Cattermole, A (2004), ‘UK banks’ write-offs of bad debt’, Monetary and Financial Statistics, Bank of England, September. (2) The correspondence between the numbers of insolvencies and write-offs is not  one-for-one.  Lenders report that under a third of UK banks’ recent write-offs on their household lending arose from instances where the borrower became bankrupt or insolvent.  The majority reflect instances where neither the lender nor the debtor pursues bankruptcy proceedings.  Fraud is estimated by some lenders to have accounted for around 10%–20% of write-offs in 2004. (3) Details of the average debt of bankrupts and the prevalence of Income Payment Orders and Agreements are based on administrative data maintained by the Insolvency Service.  turnover.  It would also be likely to increase if homeownership continues to spread, for example as the Government implements its plans to increase the stock of lower-cost housing.  The outlook for unsecured debt is less clear.  Credit card borrowing growth has eased recently (Chart 1.8).  However, the level of unsecured debt relative to household income in the United Kingdom remains almost 20% lower than in the United States, suggesting that there may be scope for further increases. The average proportion of households’ income that is used to service debt has risen further over the past year (Chart 1.1 5), because of higher borrowing.  But the increases in mortgage debt and repayments appear not to have translated into a corresponding increase in financial pressures on households; the proportion of households reporting problems making mortgage repayments (for a given level of payments relative to income) has declined over the past ten years, and mortgage arrears are very low by historical standards.(1) Again, for unsecured debt, the picture is more complicated.  The rise in personal insolvencies is likely to reflect problems households have repaying unsecured debt.(2) The increase in unsecured debt may have led to an improvement in welfare, if it has helped households to smooth their consumption during temporary periods of lower income.  However, it also raises their vulnerability to any future adverse financial shock and it is possible that some households have underestimated this  risk. The general rise in unsecured debt may mask a sharper increase among a minority of households.(3) As discussed in a recent House of Commons Treasury Committee report,(4) some households have borrowed so much that they might struggle to meet future debt repayments even in the absence of a major income shock.  This credit may have been available because lenders have an incomplete picture of customer characteristics (as discussed below).  In addition, a good payment history may well be sufficient to encourage lenders to provide new loans, even though the debt may place a heavy burden on the household.  Greater credit availability may help to explain the quadrupling over the past ten years in the number of insolvencies among the employed.

Income and unemployment Over the past decade, income shocks and unemployment have been the most significant proximate causes of household debt problems.(1) Reassuringly, labour market conditions remain benign.  In real terms, households’ income grew by about 3% in the year to 2005 Q1.  And both the unemployment rate and inflows into unemployment have halved since the early 1 990s (Chart 1.1 6).  However, insolvencies amongst those not in employment have roughly doubled over this time, perhaps reflecting the increased take-up of credit and the consequent rise in vulnerability to adverse income shocks. House prices Although the average level of UK house prices has changed little in recent months, the financial position of many homeowners has been strengthened by the rise over the previous few years.  High levels of housing equity have enabled some homeowners to remortgage to refinance other debts or mortgage arrears.  They have also provided others with a cushion of protection from any future negative shocks.  Reflecting these factors, a recent survey found that 40% of mortgage holders agreed with the statement, ‘My house value has risen so much that I do not worry about other debts I may have’.(2) To the extent that accommodation costs move in line with house prices, the increase in house prices has weakened their financial position.(3) As discussed in the May Inflation Report (page 40), the housing market will probably remain subdued.  It is therefore likely that, in the future, fewer households will be able to use housing equity to refinance their debt.  And, if loan-to-value (LTV) ratios at house purchase remain unchanged, the average degree of collateralisation across lenders’ mortgage books is likely to fall. This suggests that the pressures on households associated with mortgage debt may rise from their current exceptionally low levels. Lenders’ risk management practices If any of the risks identified above were to crystallise, lenders’ losses would depend both on the composition of their assets and the effectiveness of their risk management. Challenges posed by secured debt For lenders, the rise in house prices has increased the value of collateral and hence reduced the likely cost of any default.  The LTV ratio on the major UK banks’ stock of lending averages around 45% (for those banks that disclose figures).  Together with the long-term decline in defaults on secured debt, that helps to explain the extremely low level of losses on mortgage 22 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) See Coles, A (1 992), ‘Causes and characteristics of arrears and possessions’, Council of Mortgage Lenders Housing Finance, No. 1 3, and Del-Rio, A and Young, G (2005), ‘The impact of unsecured debt on financial distress among British households’, Bank of England Working Paper no. 262.

In aggregate, lenders seem well protected against adverse movements in house prices, with LTV ratios on new lending continuing to be considerably lower than during the early 1 990s (Chart 1.17). At the same time as LTV ratios have fallen relative to levels in the early 1 990s, loan-to-income (LTI) ratios have risen significantly (Chart 1.1 8).  As noted in the August 2002 Inflation Report, the decline in inflation over the past decade has allowed borrowers to service larger debts (because of the reduction in front-end loading of mortgage payments).  But, more recently, some lenders have reported concerns about affordability with respect to some highly indebted borrowers, and have planned to tighten lending criteria (such as reducing LTI ratios on new lending). Imposing limits on LTV and LTI ratios are two different ways to manage losses on secured lending.  There is little evidence that lenders are writing a significant proportion of loans at both high LTV ratios and high LTI ratios.  The FSA tracks such ‘higher risk’ loans, and data for 2004 Q4 show that such lending remains a small part of total new lending and has risen only slightly in recent years.  And, with the decline in nominal interest rates over the past 1 5 years, a much smaller proportion of new borrowers now have both high income gearing and high LTV ratios than in the late 1 980s.(1) Challenges posed by unsecured debt The rapid growth in credit card exposures discussed earlier presents risk management challenges for lenders, who need to be able to measure the riskiness of their lending accurately and to price it accordingly. Accurate credit assessment depends on good data on customer characteristics, particularly those related to borrowers’ propensity to repay.  But affordability can be difficult to measure when borrowers have relationships with many lenders.  Market contacts indicate that some lenders try to reduce credit risk by targeting customers who already have a current account with them (so that they are then able to monitor payments across the customer’s account).  And an increasing number of lenders are sharing information on good repayment histories as well as information on arrears and defaults, helping lenders assess servicing capability more accurately.  The British Bankers’ Association (BBA) has intermediated an agreement for all major banks to share data on credit card and loan accounts by the end of 2005.  Some sharing of current account data already occurs, although full sharing of data across all portfolios is not planned. Lenders use the results of their credit assessments either to price their lending to match the perceived riskiness or as the basis of The financial stability conjuncture and outlook — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 23 (1) Hancock, M and Wood, R (2004), ‘Household secured debt’, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Autumn. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 1 988 90 92 94 96 98 2000 02 04 4 or above Unknown (a) (b) Percentage of total  0.00–1.99 3–3.99 2–2.99 Chart 1.18 UK lenders’ new mortgage lending by loan-to-income ratio band Source:  Council of Mortgage Lenders.

If lenders do issue unsecured debt to a customer, they can continue to use credit analysis to manage potential credit losses by monitoring factors that may indicate that borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties, such as making only minimum repayments, being over 30 days in arrears, or failing to make agreed payments on arrears.  Lenders can then take action to limit loss given default.  For example, some lenders have said that they may refer some customers to debt counsellors, increase their debt collection activities as credit quality declines or reduce credit limits. However, immediate action to limit risk exposures by reducing available credit facilities to indebted households may increase the financial constraints on those households, with possible implications for arrears on their other borrowing.  So a strategy to minimise losses across the banking sector as a whole could require some degree of forbearance, particularly as a significant proportion of individuals have multiple credit cards  (Chart 1.1 9).  But, were a lender to fear that its competitors would act pre-emptively at the first sign of stress, the lender is less likely to exercise forbearance itself.  There is therefore a potential co-ordination problem. However, signs of stress are limited, so this co-ordination challenge is not an immediate issue.  And, while there are risks, the major UK banks’ credit assessment techniques have improved over the past decade.  This has enabled them to extend credit to a greater number of customers, while helping the banks to be better prepared for an increase in credit losses from current low levels, should such an increase materialise. 1.2  UK corporate credit risks Lending to UK-resident private non-financial companies (PNFCs) represents almost 7% of the major UK banks’ total assets.  And, on a global basis, almost 40% of their ‘large’ exposures to non-financial companies are to UK-owned firms.(1) Exposures of the major UK banks Major UK banks’ lending to UK-resident commercial property companies(2) has continued to grow over twice as fast as their other corporate lending;  commercial property now accounts for over half of major UK banks’ new lending to UK-resident  non-financial companies and over a third of the stock of lending. It is these lenders’ largest single industrial exposure (Chart 1.20) 24 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — The financial stability conjuncture and outlook 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 2000 01 02 03 04 With one card With two cards With three or more cards Percentage of respondents Chart 1.19 Credit card prevalence(a) Sources:  MORI MFS and Bank calculations.

(a) Refers to peer group discussed in Box 1, page 1 8.  and has become increasingly concentrated (Chart 1.2 1).  There may also be additional indirect exposures to property, as about a fifth of banks’ total corporate lending is to small and  medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often use property as collateral. Property also accounts for a significant proportion of major UK banks’ large exposures (Chart 1.22), alongside the motor sector and large conglomerates.  Such exposures are assessed on a global basis, reflecting the fact that banks lend to both UK and non-UK large companies through both their domestic and overseas operations. Insolvencies and write-offs UK company insolvencies have declined steadily since 2003, and the insolvency rate has fallen to its lowest level for 25 years.  The write-off rate on corporate lending is also low by historical standards, although it has remained broadly unchanged over recent years (Chart 1.23).  Disclosures in published accounts reveal that recovery rates on this lending have recently been higher than expected, with some banks making write-backs on earlier expected bad debts.(1) Stress on banks’ commercial property lending remained very low in 2004, with an average annual provision rate of less than 0.1%. The reduction in company insolvencies has been greater than implied by the historical relationship with companies’ debt, profitability and the macroeconomic environment.(2) One possible explanation for this is the introduction of the Enterprise Act (effective from September 2003 for companies), which has promoted a more rescue-orientated regime by making it easier for firms in financial difficulties to enter administration. But our contacts do not believe that this has been the only important factor;  the rise in administrations has been relatively small and the reduction in insolvencies started before the implementation of the new legal regime.  Market contacts instead believe that the fall in the insolvency rate may partly reflect an increase in the willingness of existing creditors to maintain finance to ailing companies.  And there remains a strong appetite for distressed debt from other investors.  Thus, although financial stress within the corporate sector has been low by normal standards, it is unclear whether it has declined materially in the past two years.

Financial pressures on companies Aggregate profitability The low levels of write-offs and insolvencies reflect strong profitability among firms.  High oil prices have boosted profits among UK oil producers.  But the net rate of return on capital among other companies also remains above its long-run average (Chart 1.24).  This mainly reflects the high level of profits in the service sector;  the net rate of return among manufacturing companies is below its long-run average and fell from 9% in 2003 Q4 to 6% in 2005 Q1.  The latest Consensus forecast is that economy-wide profits growth will slow to 5% in 2005, from 8% in 2004. Disaggregate measures of profitability and dispersion Although the corporate sector as a whole is relatively profitable by historical standards, that could mask problems in the lower tail of the earnings distribution.  Company accounts data for 2004 reveal that there was still a significant minority of firms making low or zero profits (Chart 1.25).  But, despite high dispersion by historical standards, profit margins in 2003 and 2004 increased throughout the distribution.  And, since the start of the year, share prices have increased in most of the major industrial sectors.  But pressures among a minority of companies may have been more pronounced, with causes including:  high oil prices (particularly for energy-intensive users, including airlines);  competitive pressures (partly driven by the long-term fall in import prices and trade liberalisation);  and the slowdown in consumer spending since late 2004.(1) These pressures have contributed to the rise in profit warnings among quoted UK companies (Chart 1.26). Companies’ debt The robust level of PNFCs’ profits in 2004 helped them remain in financial surplus.  This contributed to a small reduction in their net debt, with the increase in financial assets more than offsetting a slight rise in gross debt.  The small increase in gross debt comprised relatively robust bank borrowing (due to demand from commercial property companies), weak bond issuance and a net repurchase of equity — trends that have continued into the first quarter of 2005 (Chart 1.27). Firms’ total debt, relative to their capital stock or current earnings, remains high by historical standards (Chart 1.28).  This follows the increase in borrowing at the beginning of the decade, which was partly used to fund the high volume of merger and acquisition activity and, for the telecoms sector, the 3G mobile phone licences.  Company accounts data for 2004 suggest that average gearing has fallen in most major sectors since then, including in those — such as telecommunications — where it had risen most sharply. 26 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) These issues are discussed further in the May 2005 Inflation Report (pages 1 4, 32 and 33). 0 5 10 15 20 25 1989 91 93 95 97 99 2001 03 All Service sector Manufacturing Other Per cent Chart 1.24 Non-oil PNFCs’ net rate of return on capital(a)(b) Sources:  ONS and Bank of England.

Despite its recent slight reduction, the higher-than-average level of gearing suggests that the corporate sector remains more vulnerable than normal to adverse shocks.  And there is little evidence that firms are seeking to reduce gearing further:  net equity issuance is negative, and a net balance of only 4% of companies in 2005 Q1 believed that their gearing was too high, down from 6% in 2004 Q3.(1) There appears to be little pressure from investors to reduce gearing;  indeed, there has been a rapid increase in highly leveraged private equity transactions (Box 3). Pension fund deficits continue to put financial pressure on some companies.  The total deficit among FTSE 350 companies (excluding the financial sector) was about £60 billion at the end of April, little changed over the past twelve months.(2) Projected liabilities on the FRS17 reporting basis were £3 1 5 billion, around a third of the size of the firms’ traditional on-balance-sheet debt. These pension liabilities increase the responsiveness of firms’ share prices to a given unexpected change in their profitability (Box 4). However, despite high debt and pension commitments, companies in general are having little difficulty in servicing their debt.  Robust profitability and low borrowing rates have ensured that income cover remains above average (Chart 1.29).  And firms’ liquidity has risen to a further record level (Chart 1.30). This may partly reflect stronger-than-expected profits, while market contacts have pointed to the cost of paying down long-term debt early. Market indicators Sterling corporate bond spreads and credit default swap premia remain low, despite the (since partially reversed) tick-up earlier in 2005.  And the increase is partly attributable to sterling bonds issued by non-UK companies, such as some in the US motor industry.(3) Equity prices have risen slightly over the past six months and the FTSE All-Share index remains about 50% above its trough in 2003.  Since then, the likelihood of corporate default (as measured by a model based upon leverage, equity prices and volatilities)(4) has eased substantially, with the reduction more pronounced among companies with higher debt (Chart 1.3 1). Commercial property Investors have continued to increase their exposure to the commercial property sector.  For some, this reflects a desire to reverse a reduction in the weight of property in their portfolios in the early-1 990s.

(2) Data include bankruptcy, liquidation and going private acquisitions, leveraged buy-outs, management buy-outs and buy-ins, and secondary buy-outs of UK targets by UK acquirers. (3) Kaplan, S and Stein, J (1 993), ‘The evolution of buy-out pricing and financial structure in the 1 980s’, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 108, Pages 3 1 3–57 . Private equity (PE) investors (including funds of funds,(1) pension funds and banks) provide equity capital to unquoted firms.  They typically acquire a controlling stake in businesses, with a view to generating added value and selling at a profit, on average after five years.  In the United Kingdom, PE companies have become more prominent over the past nine years (Chart A). Private equity firms can use their expertise to enforce better management, cut inefficiencies and improve performance.  But do PE transactions raise financial stability concerns? Typically, such transactions involve substantial borrowing, mainly bank debt, to increase the potential returns to the equity investors.  This leverage amplifies the effects of the business cycle and so increases risks in a downturn.  Market contacts report that the amount of additional gearing provided by the PE deal — as proxied by the share of debt relative to equity financing of these deals — is substantially lower now than in the 1 980s, suggesting that the risks are more evenly distributed between new equity investors and lenders.  And the original gearing of firms prior to the PE deal, though it has risen over the past few years, remains on average lower than in the early 1 990s (Chart B).(2) This  period coincided with the UK ‘buy-out bust’, when the number of buy-out exits by receivership was higher than the number of exits by trade sale or flotation. Are banks correctly pricing the risk intrinsic in lending for such acquisitions?  If buy-out prices are too high relative to intrinsic values, the deals could end in default — resulting in unplanned losses to investors and other lenders.  Kaplan and Stein(3) find evidence linking the early-1 990s US buy-out bust with the overheating of this market in the late-1 980s.  The ratio of transaction value to EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) is generally regarded as a good measure of how appropriately a business is priced.  Data show that, on average, this ratio has risen, and the median is at its highest historical level  (Chart C).  This suggests that some transactions may indeed reflect unduly optimistic or inconsistent valuations;  but very highly priced deals account for a lower share of the market than in 1 989, so the mean ratio is lower than it was then. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 1995 96 97 98 99 2000 01 02 03 04 Funds raised Funds invested £ billions Chart A Value of funds raised and invested by UK private equity firms(a)  Source:  British Venture Capital Association.

The financial stability conjuncture and outlook — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 29 The emergence of deficits on defined-benefit pension schemes has added to the vulnerability of the sponsoring companies. Because accrued liabilities of defined-benefit schemes are like debt, they add to the total ‘economic leverage’ of firms.  Chart A shows how the distribution of leverage for a sample of  non-financial FTSE 100 companies changes when defined-benefit pension deficits and surpluses are added to their ordinary on-balance-sheet net debt;  the tail of companies with high leverage increases.  Ignoring such deficits would provide an incomplete picture of the health of the UK corporate sector. The impact of higher leverage on the probability of corporate default is well understood.  What is perhaps less apparent is the extent to which any underlying volatility in company valuations is amplified by the additional leverage induced by pension schemes. A standard gearing effect arises because the values of equity assets in pension schemes do not move in line with the debt-like defined-benefit liabilities.  Hence the proportional effect of a shock on a company’s market capitalisation is larger, the greater the value of its liabilities, including those in its pension fund. There is also an additional impact because many pension funds are heavily invested in UK equities, so that their value responds to the effect of any shock on the valuation of other UK companies. The size of these effects can be estimated for the FTSE 100 companies by simulating the response of their market capitalisation to a common 5% decline in the valuation of their underlying business, taking account of the actual size of their pension fund liabilities and other debt, the size of their pension fund assets and the proportion invested in equity.  It is estimated that this shock would reduce the market capitalisation of the average company by around 10%.(1) Chart B shows that the distribution of impacts is skewed.  For most companies, the simulated impacts on market valuations are less than or equal to 10%;  but, for a few, they are more substantial.  In many companies, contributions to defined-benefit pension schemes have been raised recently.  In addition, greater awareness and better management of the assets and liabilities of schemes should improve their funding positions in the future, and hence the health of the aggregate balance sheet of the UK corporate sector. This will also tend to lower the impact of adverse shocks on corporate share prices.

The majority of finance is secured on existing property.  However, the fraction allocated to speculative projects increased to 8% in 2004, from 5% in 2002.  Although this includes some residential development, and remains considerably below the 30% proportion in the late-1 980s,(1) it is possible that speculative activity will pick up further, at least on the basis of planned London office construction (Chart 1.32). And it is likely that some of the funds used for investment in existing properties have been used to refurbish previously untenanted buildings, increasing the stock of available property. But an absence of comprehensive statistics for sectors outside the London office market makes it difficult to gauge the prospective balance between supply and demand. Strong investor demand has put further upward pressure on commercial property values, which rose by 1 1% in the year to April 2005.  The increase partly reflects the historically low level of long-term interest rates and investors’ search for yield.  It has been less marked than in previous commercial property cycles (even in real terms) and, over the past few years, prices have increased by less than for residential property.  But capital values appear to reflect an expectation that rental growth will pick up.  A recent survey of market participants by the Investment Property Forum indicated a mean expectation that nominal rental values would increase by 2.8% per year over the next five years, compared with rental growth of 2.1% in the year to April.  There is a risk that these expectations will not be met;  rental growth expectations have in the past proved to be excessively optimistic,(2) with actual rental growth on average over the past 20 years below the rate of inflation.  Also, as noted above, surveys point to a weakening in PNFCs’ profits growth, particularly within the retail sector (which accounts for about a third of commercial property lending). Rental growth in the London office market may continue to be depressed by high vacancy levels (Chart 1.33).  If there were a downturn in capital and rental growth — and the sector has proved in the past to be highly cyclical (Box 5) — loan-to-value (LTV) covenants could be breached.  This could make refinancing more difficult — an important issue given that a quarter of all property loans are due to be repaid in the next three years  (Chart 1.34). Lenders’ risk management practices Discussions with representatives of several of the major UK banks suggest that the spreads on their corporate lending in 2004 and early 2005 declined in line with movements in bond spreads.  And, despite their recent tick-up, they remain narrow by historical standards.

The financial stability conjuncture and outlook — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 31 Box 5:  Commercial property:  historical comparisons (1) These episodes contributed to the ‘fringe’ or secondary banks’ crisis in the 1 970s and the small banks crisis in the 1 990s.  See Logan, A, (2000), ‘The early 1 990s small banks crisis: leading indicators’, Bank of England Financial Stability Review, December. (2) This change was much sharper than for quoted PNFCs in general, for which the fraction making a loss increased from 3% to 1 5% over this time. (3) BIS (2001), BIS 7 1st Annual Report, BIS. (4) Attanasio, O and Weber, G (1 994), ‘The UK consumption boom of the late 1 980s: aggregate implications of microeconomic evidence’, Economic Journal, Vol. 104, Issue 427 . There are some similarities between current conditions in the commercial property sector and those that preceded the mid-1 970s and early-1 990s property downturns.(1) First, in real terms, the rate of increase in capital values is high by historical standards (Chart A).  Second, rapid bank lending growth has increased banks’ exposures to the sector (Chart B).  And third, despite some recent easing, London office vacancy rates are close to their early-1 990s level. These downturns revealed how rapidly fortunes within the commercial property sector can reverse.  Between 1 988 and 1 992, the fraction of quoted property companies making a loss rose from zero to almost 30%.(2) And the United Kingdom is not alone in having experienced pronounced commercial property cycles. Between the peak in commercial property prices in the  mid-1 980s and their trough in the mid-1 990s, the average fall in values across developed countries was 44%, greater than the 27% UK decline.(3) But there are significant differences between current conditions and those that preceded previous downturns.  The late-1 980s property boom accompanied very strong real GDP growth, which averaged over 5% between late 1 987 and 1 988, about twice its average rate over the past two years.  The rapid economic growth was accompanied by a rise in expectations about future growth (which subsequently proved to be unfounded).(4) This belief may have contributed to the rise in speculative development, much of which was completed just as the early-1 990s recession hit.  The early-1 970s and late-1 980s economic booms were also accompanied by a pronounced rise in inflation, and the subsequent sharp increases in interest rates added to the financial pressures on property companies.  It is also possible that the amplitude of commercial property cycles has been lower in recent years (Chart A).  And banks’ risk management practices have been improved, with closer monitoring of loans, greater use of stress testing and the prospect of ‘risk-sensitive’ capital requirements under the Basel II framework. 40 30 20 10 0 10 20 30 1972 77 82 87 92 97 2002 Per cent Nominal Real – + Chart A Annual growth of commercial property capital values(a) Sources:  Investment Property Databank, ONS and Bank calculations.

(especially to large firms), including fees and covenant requirements, also remain low. The easing in lending conditions has been particularly notable for commercial property loans, where maximum average LTVs increased in 2004, while income cover and lending margins fell.(1) In addition, much recent lending has been used to increase the debt secured against existing properties.  But, despite this easing in terms, typical maximum LTV ratios on prime new lending remain around 80%, while the recent rise in commercial property capital values provides lenders with additional protection against any future downturn.  Rental receipts on let buildings typically exceed interest cover by about 20%–30% (although the risks associated with lending for speculative development are higher).  And some lending has provided finance for property companies to buy buildings from firms, who subsequently lease them back (‘sale and leaseback’). The risks associated with this lending are likely to be low if it is secured against the rental stream from good quality tenants. Nevertheless, if the unusually low recent rate of corporate and commercial property write-offs mainly reflects the favourable short-term conjuncture, the relaxation in lending terms could lead to a larger-than-expected increase in banks’ future losses. 1.3  The United States UK-owned banks’ exposures to borrowers in the United States(2) increased by 12% in the second half of 2004, partly reflecting the acquisition by the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) of Charter One.  At end-2004, claims on the United States accounted for 1 4% of the assets of UK-owned banks, mostly via US branches and subsidiaries.  Box 6 explores the foreign exposures of  UK-owned banks in more detail. Published accounts data suggest that Barclays, HSBC and RBS account for the vast majority of UK-owned banks’ local office claims on the UnitedStates.  Barclays focuses on capital markets and investment banking.  By contrast, loans account for over 60% of the assets of both HSBC North America and the main US subsidiary of RBS, Citizens Financial.  Residential mortgages represent over half their combined loan portfolio, with credit card and other consumer lending accounting for another quarter (Chart 1.35).  UK-owned banks also have significant holdings of residential mortgage-backed securities, so developments in the US household sector are potentially important for the UK financial system. 32 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) Maxted, W and Porter, T (2005), ‘The UK commercial property lending market’,  De Montfort University.

UK-owned banks have relatively little direct exposure to commercial and industrial firms via their US branches and subsidiaries.  However, most of their cross-border claims on the US non-bank private sector are likely to be on non-financial companies.  Furthermore, as recent events at General Motors (GM) and Ford have shown, developments in the US corporate sector can have a significant impact on international capital markets (see Chapter2.1). Claims on USbanks account for 1 3% of UK-owned banks’ claims on the United States (Chart1.36).  Developments in the US financial sector can also affect UK financial stability because large USbanks and securities houses are major counterparties for the large UK-owned banks in securities and derivatives markets. The private non-financial sector The economic environment for US borrowers is expected to remain benign;  the Consensus forecast is for continued robust GDP growth in 2005 and 2006.  Financial market participants’ expectations of the path of official interest rates have not changed significantly since the December Review, with rates expected to rise gradually from 3% to around 4% by end-2006. The household sector Charge-off rates on US residential mortgages have remained low — perhaps not surprising given that the unemployment rate has fallen slightly and house prices have continued to rise rapidly. Non-current(1) loan rates have fallen further since the previous Review (Chart 1.37), despite the increase in short-term interest rates and the continued strong growth in mortgage debt.  The increase in the aggregate financial obligations ratio(2) of homeowners (Chart 1.38) has been relatively limited — largely because of the preponderance of long-term fixed-rate mortgages. However, since mid-2003, there appears to have been a marked shift in new originations towards adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs),(3) which, if it were sustained, could significantly increase the interest sensitivity of household debt.  According to a recent survey by the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA),(4) ARMs and interest-only (IO) mortgages accounted for 63% of mortgage originations in the second half of 2004.  The ARM share of new mortgages typically increases when the yield curve is upward sloping.  Given the impact of the large rise in house prices on affordability, the relatively high ARM share and the increase in IOmortgages may partly reflect the need for some borrowers to minimise their initial mortgage payments.

The new data split UK-owned banks’ foreign exposures into cross-border claims (eg a UK-owned bank’s UK office’s claims on a Spanish resident) and local office claims (eg a UK-owned bank’s Spanish office’s claims on a Spanish resident).(1) The new data also enhance disclosure by providing information on both risk transfers and sectoral breakdowns of local office claims for the first time.(2) Risk transfers The new data allow total foreign exposures to be adjusted for risk transfers, where previously this had only been possible for cross-border claims.  Risk transfer data allow credit risks to be tracked to the country from which they ultimately emanate.  For example, a UK-owned bank could have an exposure to a German-owned firm resident in Ireland.  If the German parent has guaranteed the firm’s borrowing, then the credit risk ultimately lies in Germany, not Ireland. Such legally enforceable guarantees of overseas associates are the main source of risk transfers across countries and are mostly associated with banks and other firms (both financial and non-financial).  Chart A shows that there is a net transfer of risk to industrial countries.  Some of this risk transfer is associated with claims that were originally on borrowers in non-industrial countries, but most relates to claims originally on foreign banks operating in the United Kingdom.  These claims on banks give rise to almost all of the net outward risk transfers from the United Kingdom shown in Chart A. Sectoral breakdowns Whereas the old data did not separate local office claims by sector, the new data do.  Now both cross-border and local office claims can be split into three customer sectors:  public bodies; banks;  and the non-bank private sector, capturing claims on private firms (including non-bank financial firms) and individuals.  Chart B shows that local office claims (the bulk of which are denominated in local currencies) account for over half of UK-owned banks’ total foreign claims. The pale blue bars on Chart C represent the portion of regional claims about which there were previously no sectoral data. Chart C and Table A confirm that the non-bank private sector dominates UK-owned banks’ claims on the United States and Box 6:  UK-owned banks’ foreign exposures:  new returns (1) Previously, cross-border claims and local office claims in non-local currencies were collected together and called ‘international claims’.

In Developed Europe, however, the banking sector is more important. At end-December 2004, the United States accounted for 34% of UK-owned banks’ total foreign exposures, and 86% of those exposures were to the non-bank private sector.  A large part of these claims were on US households.  Developed Europe accounted for 35% of total foreign exposures, of which 55% were to European banks.  In Germany, the second largest country exposure after the United States, the banking sector accounted for 70% of total claims.  A substantial portion of these claims are likely originally to have been on German banks’ offices in London, but the risk has been transferred to their German headquarters.

Another factor in the rise in the ARM share has been the increase in sub-prime and low documentation (‘Alt-A’) mortgages, which tend to be adjustable rather than fixed-rate.  Sub-prime and Alt-A mortgages accounted for nearly one third of new mortgage originations in the second half of 2004. The average loan-to-value ratio (LTV) for outstanding mortgages is about 44%, so there is an equity cushion which would provide substantial protection for lenders against all but the most extreme declines in house prices.  Less than a fifth of new first-lien mortgages in 2004 had LTVs of more than 90%. Charge-off rates on credit cards fell in the second half of last year, reflecting the trend in personal bankruptcies, whereas charge-off rates on other consumer lending have been broadly flat (Chart1.40).  In response to guidance from regulators, several of the major credit card issuers announced plans to increase minimum payments to ensure that the outstanding balance is repaid within a reasonable period.  In future, payments must cover all fees and interest charges plus 1% of the outstanding balance.  In the short run, the higher minimum repayment is likely to push up arrears and charge-offs. The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, which will take effect in October2005, tightens up the personal bankruptcy regime and may have a significant impact on personal bankruptcies and charge-off rates on consumer debt. Individuals can currently choose between filing for bankruptcy under ChapterVII or ChapterXIII of the US bankruptcy code. Under ChapterVII, unsecured creditors receive the proceeds from the sale of any non-exempt property but do not have any claim on the individual’s future income.  In most cases, unsecured creditors receive nothing, as all of the debtor’s property is exempt.  Under ChapterXIII, debts are repaid from current and future income under a plan, typically for three to five years, agreed with creditors and authorised by the bankruptcy court.  Perhaps the most significant change is that the Act allows creditors to ask the bankruptcy court to determine whether the individual has sufficient income for a Chapter XIII repayment plan.  This may lead to an improvement in recovery rates, as a greater proportion of individuals have to file under Chapter XIII instead of Chapter VII.  However, in the short run, the Act may lead to a rise in bankruptcies as people bring forward their bankruptcy filings to try to avoid the stricter rules. The non-financial corporate sector Corporate credit quality improved further in 2005 Q1, with the proportion of non-current C&I loans falling to its lowest level since 1 999 and charge-off rates on C&I loans remaining low 36 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — The financial stability conjuncture and outlook 10 5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 1976 80 84 88 92 96 2000 04 US house price index California Florida Percentage changes on a year earlier  – + Chart 1.39 US house prices by region Sources: OFHEO, Thomson Financial Datastream and Bank calculations. 0 50 100 1 50 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 1 988 90 92 94 96 98 2000 02 04 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Per cent Number of filings Personal bankruptcy filings (right-hand scale) Credit card charge-offs   (left-hand scale) Charge-offs on other consumer loans   (left-hand scale)  Chart 1.40 Personal bankruptcies and charge-offs on consumer lending(a) Sources: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Bank calculations.

Chapter XI bankruptcy filings also remain low. Backward-looking indicators of the health of the corporate sector are generally benign.  In 2005 Q1, income gearing and capital gearing at replacement cost were at, or close to, their lowest level since 1 998 (Chart1.42).  Corporate sector liquidity was strong at end-March 2005;  the ratio of cash and other liquid assets to short-term debt was close to its highest level since the 1 950s. However, there are two notable exceptions to this generally benign picture:  the auto sector, which has been badly hit by the problems at GM and Ford;  and the airlines, which are struggling to cope with the sustained high level of oil prices. Both GM and Ford have been losing market share in the United States for some time though, until recently, they had been able to maintain profitability through their strong position in the highly profitable sports utility vehicle (SUV) market segment.  However, this year, SUV sales have fallen and both GM and Ford have lost market share.  Credit default swap (CDS) premia of GM and Ford rose sharply after they issued profit warnings in, respectively, mid-March and mid-April and again after Standard and Poor’s (S&P) downgraded their debt to below investment-grade in May, though they fell back more recently (Chart 1.43).  These developments had a significant impact on the high-yield bond market, which had to absorb nearly $50 billion of GM debt(1) (see also Chapter 2.1).  The problems at GM and Ford have seriously affected the US auto-parts industry.  Delphi and Visteon, the two largest US firms, have been downgraded by at least four notches by the three main rating agencies since the previous Review, while five smaller suppliers have filed for Chapter XI. Most major US passenger airlines have been badly affected by the sustained high level of oil prices.  Most of the major airlines recorded further losses in 2005 Q1 and their CDS premia remain high.  The direct exposures of UK and US banks are small and mostly secured on aircraft assets, providing some protection in the case of default. Banking Overall, the US banking sector remains robust.  Published capital ratios are high, profitability is reasonably strong and credit quality continues to improve.  However, since the December Review, bank share prices have slightly underperformed the S&P500 and CDS premia for large domestic banks have risen marginally. The profits of US commercial banks fell slightly in 2004 Q4 but bounced back in 2005 Q1.  The first-quarter profits of US commercial banks were boosted by record trading revenues, as fixed-income trading performed very strongly (Chart 1.44).

However, the recent turmoil in structured credit markets may have affected some second-quarter revenues (Chapter 2.1).  The return on equity remained relatively low because of the high level of goodwill arising from mergers (Chart 1.45).  Net interest income fell in the first quarter, as a sharp decline in net interest margins more than offset continued loan growth.  The decline in net interest margins partly reflected faster repricing of liabilities as short-term interest rates rose.  However, net interest margins are at their lowest level for almost 1 5 years. Profits continued to benefit from the decline in loan-loss provisions, which fell by a further $1.4 billion in 2005 Q1.  The coverage ratio of loan-loss reserves to non-current loans increased once again because of the continued improvement in loan quality.  However, falling loan-loss provisions are unlikely to be a significant source of future profit growth because loan-loss reserves have reached such a low level;  the ratio of loan loss reserves to total loans at end-March 2005 was at its lowest level since the mid-1 980s.  In the three months to April, banks continued to ease C&I lending standards but reported  little change in standards for mortgages or credit cards (Chart 1.46). 1.4  Europe UK-owned banks’ exposures to borrowers in the rest of Europe(1) increased by some 7% in the second half of 2004, more slowly than total overseas exposures, and accounted for some 35% of  UK-owned banks’ foreign exposures and 1 5% of UK-owned banks’ total assets.(2) Exposures to borrowers in Germany, the Benelux area and France account for the majority (Chart 1.47).  In recent years, however, exposures have grown rapidly in Ireland and Spain, partly reflecting mergers and acquisitions, but also mirroring the growth in these economies relative to the euro area as a whole. Despite a pickup in euro-area GDP growth in 2005 Q1, Consensus forecasts for euro-area growth have been revised down further, suggesting lower expectations of income growth.   Longer-term interest rates have also fallen further, however, which may partially offset any associated rise in financial pressures. More than half of UK-owned banks’ total claims on Europe are on banks, compared with less than a seventh for the United States.  That partly reflects greater participation by non-UK European banks in London’s wholesale markets;  at the end of April 2005, they accounted for over 40% of UK-resident bank assets.  This pattern of exposures implies that the impact of 38 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — The financial stability conjuncture and outlook 0 1 2 3 4 5 1993 95 97 99 2001 03 05 0 5 10 15 20 25 Per cent Per cent Net interest margin (right-hand scale) Return on equity (left-hand scale) Loan-loss provisions(b) (right-hand scale) Chart 1.45 US commercial banks:  profitability indicators(a) Source:  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

European household and corporate credit risk on UK-owned banks is more indirect than that of corresponding US risks. The household sector Euro-area banks’ loans to euro-area households have risen briskly in recent years (Chart 1.48), to account for some 1 8% of euro-area banks’ assets.  Write-offs and write-downs on bank lending to households in 2004 Q4 and 2005 Q1 were little changed on a year earlier, and the available data suggest that the share of non-performing loans remained low (Chart 1.49). The increase in lending has largely reflected rising lending for house purchase in some countries, associated with rapid rises in house prices, low interest rates, and strong competition among lenders.  Consumer credit growth has also picked up over the past year.  Household debt-to-income ratios rose further in 2004 in a number of countries, including Spain and Ireland.  That has raised households’ vulnerability to unexpected falls in income. But in Germany, household borrowing growth has remained sluggish.  And for the euro area overall, the household debt-to-income ratio remains well below that of the United Kingdom and the United States.  Income gearing is likely to have remained moderate overall, given rising nominal income and low interest rates;  and unemployment has been broadly flat.  But it has become more common to charge variable interest rates on lending, raising the interest-rate sensitivity of debt servicing. The corporate sector The data do not allow for UK-owned banks’ lending to the European corporate and household sectors to be identified separately,(1) but corporate exposures are likely to be the larger of the two.  Cross-border lending — which is likely to be predominantly corporate lending — accounts for almost half of all UK-owned banks’ lending to the private non-bank sector;  and corporate lending is also likely to account for a significant share of lending by local offices.  Bank borrowing accounts for a larger share of the debt of euro-area non-financial corporations (NFCs) than for their UK counterparts;  and euro-area banks’ loans to euro-area NFCs account for some 1 4% of total euro-area banks’ assets.  Write-offs and writedowns on banks’ corporate lending were lower in 2004 Q4 and 2005 Q1 than a year earlier.  The number of bankruptcies has remained high in some countries (Chart 1.50), however, reflecting difficult conditions for smaller firms, although UK-owned banks’ exposures to these companies are likely to be limited. The annual rate of corporate lending growth rose further in 2005 Q1, to 5.9%.  Net bond issuance also edged up, though equity issuance has remained weak.  Banks continued to report muted loan demand, according to the European Central Bank’s The financial stability conjuncture and outlook — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 39 (1) See Box 6 in this Review, which looks at UK-owned banks’ new returns on foreign exposures. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 1 4 2000 01 02 03 04 05 Total Consumer credit House purchase Other Nominal GDP Percentage changes on a year earlier Chart 1.48 Household lending in the euro area Sources:  European Central Bank and Eurostat.  0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 1999 2000 01 02 03 04 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 Belgium (right-hand scale) France (right-hand scale) Italy (right-hand scale) Spain (left-hand scale) Per cent Per cent Chart 1.49 Non-performing loans to households in selected European countries(a) Sources: Banca d’Italia, Banque de France, Banco de España,  Belgostat, and Bank calculations.

In Spain and Ireland, lending to the property and construction sectors has remained robust, adding to banks’ exposures to real estate markets.  Gross European syndicated lending rose markedly over the year to 2005 Q1, largely reflecting increased refinancing. Lending to highly geared borrowers, associated with private equity activity, has risen over recent years and remained strong in 2004 Q4 and 2005 Q1.  However, capital gearing has fallen in the past two years (Chart 1.51), reflecting some balance sheet adjustment and higher equity prices.  Income gearing is likely to have remained moderate, although, as for households, a greater use of variable-rate (and short-term fixed-rate) borrowing in recent years may have increased the interest-rate sensitivity of debt servicing.(1) European corporate credit spreads have edged higher since the December Review (Chart 1.52).  But equity prices have risen and equity price volatility has fallen, implying, other things equal, a fall in default risk.  And, in 2004 Q4, the number of ratings upgrades exceeded the number of downgrades for the first time since 1 998.  Earnings among large quoted companies have increased further in recent quarters, although high oil prices may have added to the pressures facing some firms. The banking sectors(2) Exposures to banks in the rest of Europe have broadly doubled in the past four years, to account for 8% of UK-owned banks’ total assets;  they also account for most of the major UK banks’ large exposures to international borrowers.(3) Although these exposures are greater than those to other European companies, they are likely to be less risky, as banks are generally more highly rated.  The profitability of large European banks improved further in 2004 and 2005 Q1 (Chart 1.53), and solvency ratios remained generally satisfactory. UK-owned banks’ exposures to the German banking sector represent their largest exposure to any overseas banking sector. Although German commercial bank profitability picked up in 2005 Q1, the recovery has lagged that in other countries, and profitability of core domestic businesses has remained weak, reflecting stagnant lending and strong competition.  Competitive pressures have been intensified by the scaling back of some large German banks’ international operations to focus more on the domestic corporate market, and by efforts by some foreign banks — some UK-owned — to increase lending.

Landesbanks have responded by building closer links with savings banks and increasing liquidity buffers.  Some banks in Germany have sold non-performing loans to third parties, which may increase those banks’ profitability in future. European banks’ profitability may be vulnerable to any slowdown in lending or increase in credit risk, given narrow interest margins and low provisioning levels.  Loan-to-value ratios on new mortgage lending have risen in recent years, and banks reported an easing of lending standards in the ECB’s April 2005 survey (Chart 1.54).  Against a background of intense competition in prime brokerage, with a number of banks attempting to enter or increase their share of the market, some banks — perhaps particularly the newer entrants — are said to have eased terms and conditions.  And large banks’ value-at-risk measures point to higher interest-rate risks among some banks in 2004.  European banks continue to rely heavily on market finance to fill customer funding gaps, and the average funding gap across euro-area banks appears greater than for their UK counterparts.  European banks’ CDS premia have generally edged up since the December Review (Chart 1.55), but they remain low, and the balance of ratings changes for banks has been positive. 1.5  Japan Data on UK-owned banks’ overseas exposures (Box 6) suggest that the direct exposure of the UK financial system to Japan is limited.  But, although risks have declined, Japan still has a very fragile financial system.  If public sector finances remain weak, that could lead to a rising risk premium in government bond markets.  Any worsening of Japanese financial fragility could affect international financial markets, and hence UK financial stability. Economic data were weaker than expected in late 2004, but real GDP grew strongly in 2005 Q1 and Consensus forecasts suggest continued growth in 2005 and 2006. Japan’s non-financial sectors The household sector Personal bankruptcies have continued to fall (Chart 1.56). Household sector credit quality is supported by falling unemployment and net financial assets of over 200% of GDP . Private sector bank lending to households is limited. The private non-financial corporate sector Despite the ‘soft patch’ in 2004, corporate credit quality has continued to improve.

(Chart 1.56), and rating upgrades continue to outnumber downgrades. Most measures of corporate sector profitability and indebtedness (Chart 1.57) have now improved to close to their pre-1 990 averages.  The sector continues to run a surplus of saving over investment of 3% of GDP , increasing holdings of cash and reducing debt (Chart 1.58).  It is unclear when firms will be comfortable with their reduced levels of gearing, allowing their demand for credit to rise. Japan’s banking system Recent Reviews have noted a sustained reduction in the fragility of the Japanese banking system.  This was illustrated at the beginning of April, when the reintroduction of the ¥10 million cap on insurance of demand deposits passed off smoothly. Unlike three years ago, when insurance on time deposits was capped, there were no large shifts in deposits ahead of the change, suggesting that increased confidence in the banking system is widely shared. All major banks met the Japanese Financial Services Agency’s (JFSA’s) target of halving non-performing loan (NPL) ratios from their peak by March 2005 (Chart 1.59).  Although NPL problems may linger in lending to smaller companies and at some regional banks (which were not covered by the JFSA target), the systemic risk posed by poor loan quality seems to have been greatly reduced. Market risk may have declined slightly.  In aggregate, the major bank groups reduced their equity holdings from 96% to 87% of Tier 1 capital in fiscal 2004.  And the recent rapid growth in major bank holdings of government bonds levelled off in 2004. Capital buffers have also been strengthened (Chart 1.60).  UFJ, previously the most weakly capitalised of the major banks, will merge with MTFG in October.  However, some banks continue to rely on deferred tax assets (DTAs) — tax credits which may not be realisable in a crisis(1) — to meet capital requirements. But higher profitability should improve capital quality.  In the year to March, Japan’s major banks recorded their first aggregate net profit since 2000 (Chart 1.6 1), thanks to lower losses on bad debts.  This allowed some banks to use DTAs to offset tax payments.  The improved health of the corporate sector suggests that loan losses will remain low, and there may be write-backs of provisions.  This should allow banks to continue to reduce DTAs.(2) Any rise in capital ratios may be limited, as the banks 42 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) See June 2003 Review, page 41. (2) Also, a bank’s on-balance-sheet DTAs are limited by forecast pre-tax profits.  Higher pre-tax profits will thus allow increases in on-balance-sheet DTAs, raising reported profits. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 980 82 84 86 88 90 92 94 96 98 2000 02 04 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Ratio Operating profit/sales (left-hand scale) Debt/operating cashflow(b)     (right-hand scale)  Per cent Chart 1.57 Corporate profitability and indebtedness(a) Sources:  Ministry of Finance corporate survey and Bank calculations.

Operating profitability, though, remains weak (Chart 1.6 1). Corporate lending is still falling, albeit at a slower pace, because of lack of demand, and interest margins are thin.  Retail lending, at higher margins, is growing, but remains less than a quarter of major bank lending.  The major banks’ relatively small retail networks may limit growth in this market, and increased competition may erode margins.  The banks have had some success in increasing fee income (Chart 1.6 1), mainly from sales of retail investment products.  Fees now account for a quarter of operating income, and may rise further with deregulation of securities and insurance sales. The marked improvement in balance sheets has seen Standard and Poor’s upgrade most major banks by three notches (to A) since April 2004.  Nevertheless, the Japanese banking system remains vulnerable to shocks.  The major banks are less well capitalised than their international peers, and income remains depressed by low interest rates and falling loan volumes. Standard and Poor’s also recently estimated that, although the stock of NPLs has declined, banks’ loan spreads remain too low to cover a rate of credit losses similar to that of the major US banks, and described bank credit risk pricing systems as ‘underdeveloped’. 1.6  Emerging market economies UK-owned banks’ foreign claims on emerging market economies (EMEs) rose by 17% during 2004 and, at the year’s end, accounted for one fifth of their total foreign claims.(1) Three quarters of these loans are made by local affiliates rather than cross border.  Claims rose particularly rapidly on emerging Europe (24%) and the Middle East and Africa (25%), albeit from a low base;  emerging Asia still accounts for almost three quarters of UK-owned banks’ aggregate claims on EMEs (Chart 1.62).  Exposures are likely to increase significantly again this year following Standard Chartered’s recent purchase of Korea First Bank and Barclays’ acquisition of a majority stake in ABSA in South Africa. Flows to EMEs intermediated through capital markets have also continued to expand rapidly over the past year.  According to the Institute of International Finance (IIF), equity flows to EMEs from all developed economies last year were buoyant, while non-bank debt flows were almost back to pre-Asian crisis levels.(2) Equity The financial stability conjuncture and outlook — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 43 0 2 4 6 8 Mar. 05 Sep. 04 Mar. 04 Sep. 03 Mar. 05 Sep. 04 Mar. 04 Sep. 03 Mar. 05 Sep. 04 Mar. 04 Sep. 03 Mar. 05 Sep. 04 Mar. 04 Sep. 03 Other Net deferred tax assets Per cent of risk-weighted assets UFJ MTFG SMFG Mizuho Chart 1.60 Tier 1 capital of major Japanese banking groups(a) Sources:  Published accounts and Bank calculations.

Debt and equity flows have remained strong so far during 2005, reflecting a continuation of the ‘search for yield’ by investors (see Chapter 2).  And the IIF predicts that total net capital inflows into EMEs for the year as a whole will be slightly higher than last year (Table 1.A). Most EMEs recorded very strong GDP growth in 2004, supported by a 10% increase in world trade, continuing low global real interest rates and, for primary producers, rising (non-agricultural) commodity prices.  Exchange rate appreciation against the US dollar since the previous Review has also reduced vulnerabilities somewhat for a number of EMEs with large US dollar-denominated debts, such as Brazil, the Philippines and Turkey (Chart 1.63).  Some governments have also further improved their debt structures by reducing debts denominated in, or linked to, foreign currency.(1) Against this background, there have been a number of further credit rating upgrades  over the past six months, especially in Latin America and  Asia.(2) Rising short-term world interest rates, continuing high oil prices, and slower growth of the world economy suggest that GDP growth for most EMEs will slow somewhat this year.  So far, the increase in oil prices seems to have been mainly due to stronger world demand, particularly from China.  Until now, the adverse impact on output in oil importing EMEs, especially in Asia, seems to have been balanced by rising demand for exports. Inflation rates are now rising, though, in Asia and Latin America and, in response, domestic nominal interest rates have been increased in several countries (albeit usually by less than the increase in inflation) (Chart 1.64).  Annual GDP growth fell in most EMEs in the first quarter of this year and the latest IMF and private sector Consensus forecasts both project lower but still robust GDP growth in EMEs for this year as a whole — at over 4% in all regions (Chart 1.65). The main near to medium-term risks remain external, especially  an unexpectedly sharp rise in US interest rates, a slowdown in US GDP growth or an abrupt decline of domestic demand growth in China. The interest rate and exchange rate environment The orderly depreciation of the US dollar has so far benefited many EMEs, especially those that have large dollar debts and are not reliant on the US export market (such as Turkey and 44 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) In Brazil, the share of total public sector debt denominated in local currency rose from 62% at end-2003 to 77% at end-2004 and to 84% by end-March 2005;  in Turkey, it rose by 5 percentage points between end-2003 and end-2004. (2) An exception has been the Philippines, which has been downgraded by both Moody’s and S&P because of concerns over the size of public debt and lack of progress in improving its fiscal balance.

Brazil).(1) But a disorderly fall, if accompanied by significantly higher US interest rates and lower world growth, could substantially increase EMEs’ external financing costs and, in extremis, prevent market access for some EMEs. Most EMEs would be able to withstand any such short-term liquidity shock in the near term.  Two thirds of EMEs’ sovereign external financing needs for 2005 were already achieved by the end of May.  With many EMEs now running current account surpluses, foreign exchange reserves have also been building up strongly, especially in Asia (Box 7).  The cushion of foreign exchange reserves to cover the annual gross external financing requirement (GEFR)(2) is much higher now in most EMEs than it was before the Asian crisis (Chart 1.66).(3) This has occurred despite the move towards more flexible exchange rates, which has reduced the need for reserves cover.(4) However, some countries in emerging Europe, where current account deficits and  short-term external debt financing remain high, are more vulnerable.(5) But UK-owned banks’ exposures to this region remain small — less than 5% of their total claims on EMEs (Chart 1.62). Although the short-term liquidity position looks favourable for most EMEs, the medium-term government solvency position looks less so.  Despite very strong output growth recently, primary fiscal surpluses have increased only a little, or fallen, in a number of EMEs, and government debt/GDP ratios have remained well above 40% in many countries (Chart 1.67).  A sustained period of lower output growth, combined with lower commodity prices, would probably result in still higher government debts, especially in the absence of offsetting fiscal adjustment.  The latter will be difficult to achieve in some of the more vulnerable EMEs — in Latin America and emerging Europe — where general elections are due by end-2006.  But UK-owned banks’ exposures to EMEs are concentrated mainly in the non-bank private sector, particularly through local offices (Chart 1.68).  There would only be an impact if there were spillovers from the fragility of government balance sheets to other sectors.(6) Since the Asian crisis, the ratio of corporate debt to GDP has fallen in Asia and Latin America, but has risen somewhat in The financial stability conjuncture and outlook — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 45 (1) In Turkey, for example, at the end of 2003, almost two thirds of external debt of more than one year residual maturity was denominated in USdollars, whereas the UnitedStates accounted for only 8% of exports of goods. (2) The GEFR is debt of less than one year original maturity, amortisation on longer-term debt plus the current account deficit. (3) The Financial Stability Forum Working Group on Capital Flows (2000) emphasised the importance of foreign exchange cover for short-term balance of payments financing. (4) According to the IMF (2004), the share of EMEs with free-floating exchange rates increased from around 5% at end-1 996 to 40% at end-2003 (World Economic Outlook, ChapterII, September). (5) Turkey, though, has some insurance following the recent renewal of its Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF. (6) Sovereign debt crises, though, usually do not occur without a broader financial crisis. For example, in a sample of 106 sovereign defaults, Reinhart (2002) found that the probability of a currency crisis occurring within the subsequent two years was 70% (‘Default, currency crises and sovereign credit ratings’, NBER Working Paper, No 8738). 8 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 Latin America Asia Emerging Europe Change in interest rate (per cent)  Change in inflation rate (per cent) Brazil Argentina Hungary Hong Kong – + Russia Philippines Korea Indonesia Taiwan Turkey China Poland Mexico + – 45 degree line Czech Rep.

The region now holds over 40% of the world’s reserves.(1) This box examines the balance of payments flows that have accounted for the large increase in reserves in several Asian EMEs over recent years and presents a broader measure of the foreign exchange inflow pressure faced by Asian currencies. Reserves accumulate when countries run surpluses on their aggregated current and capital account positions.  In measuring the components of reserve accumulation accounted for by the capital account, it is useful to distinguish between net foreign direct investment (FDI) and net non-FDI flows.(2) FDI flows typically reflect long-term investment decisions that are not easily reversible, while non-FDI flows are potentially more volatile.(3) Reserves growth is also affected by a change in the value of the currencies in which they are held relative to the currency in which they are measured — typically the US dollar. Since the 1 997–98 Asian financial crisis, continuous current account surpluses have made a significant positive contribution to the build-up in reserves in all the large Asian EME reserve holders other than India.  And, in 2004, this contribution was much larger than in the preceding years (Table 2).(4) Net FDI has also made a positive contribution to reserve growth in all Asian countries except Taiwan.  In China, in an accounting sense, it contributed around half of the reserve accumulation over the 1 999–2004 period.  However, the contribution of non-FDI flows has varied significantly across countries.  There have been large non-FDI outflows from HongKong and Singapore,(5) whereas there have been inflows to India and Korea since 1 998 and, more recently, to Taiwan and China.  The positive correlation between non-FDI flows to China and market expectations of renminbi appreciation (as implied by the renminbi non-deliverable forward) suggests that parts of these inflows are speculative (Chart A).(6) Box 7:  Accounting for the growth in Asian foreign exchange reserves (1) This figure rises to almost two thirds if Japan is included. (2) Net non-FDI flows are defined as the component of reserve accumulation that cannot be accounted for by net FDI, the current account and the effect of reserve revaluation. They include net borrowing from commercial banks and official creditors, net debt and equity investments, and errors and omissions. (3) Several studies point to the stability of FDI flows relative to other international capital flows.  See for example Ishii, S and Habermeier, K (2002), ‘Capital account liberalization and financial sector stability’, IMF Occasional Paper No. 21 1. (4) The depreciation in the USdollar since 2002 has also boosted the USdollar value of non-dollar reserves. (5) HongKong and Singapore differ from other Asian countries since they are major financial centres.  Capital, therefore, passes through their jurisdictions to take advantage of the financial services offered. (6) The correlation coefficient between non-FDI flows to China and renminbi non-deliverable forwards for 2004 is 0.64.  However, this calculation is based on only twelve observations, so should be treated with caution.

The financial stability conjuncture and outlook — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 47 Net balance of payments inflows generally lead to pressure for exchange rates to appreciate.  In principle, depending on the currency regime and extent of capital controls, this upward pressure can be relieved through exchange rate intervention (resulting in reserve accumulation), nominal currency appreciation or a reduction in domestic interest rates.  Most Asian countries have managed-floating exchange rate regimes, giving them some scope to respond to foreign exchange inflows with a combination of policies.  China, Hong Kong and Malaysia, however, maintain explicit or implicit fixed exchange rate pegs and so are restricted to managing upward pressure using intervention or domestic interest rates.(1) Between 1 999 and 2003, Asian currencies with managed-floating regimes remained broadly stable against the US dollar (Table 3). Foreign exchange inflow pressure was reflected instead in a build-up in reserves across the region.  But during 2004 this pressure increased significantly.(2) The Korean won, Indian rupee, Singapore dollar and Taiwan dollar all appreciated.  At the same time, there was an even more rapid accumulation of reserves across the region than previously.  The build-up in reserves in Korea, India, Singapore and Taiwan would possibly have been greater still if not for exchange rate appreciation.  In Korea, the exchange market pressure was also partly reduced by a narrowing in the differential between domestic and US interest rates. There are typically two main motives for building up reserves:  to protect the currency against the risk of sudden capital outflows and to prevent currency appreciation in order to support export-led growth.  Given that reserves now far exceed gross external financing requirements in most Asian countries (Chart1.66 in Chapter 1.6), the marginal benefit of reserve accumulation for insurance appears to be limited.  The export-led strategy has been successful in achieving fast output growth rates in the region, but it also means that the maintenance of strong growth is vulnerable to external developments.  An exchange rate appreciation may increase real incomes and consumption, and thus stimulate production for the domestic market.  In considering future exchange rate policies, authorities will need to take these vulnerabilities and imbalances into account.

However, firm-specific data show that the share of short-term corporate debt in EMEs remains high, and foreign currency mismatches appear to be large, especially in Latin America.(1) Slowdown in China The near-term risk of a sharp slowdown in the Chinese economy has fallen since the December Review, but there remains a significant medium-term risk.  A marked slowdown of the Chinese economy would increase further the fragility of the domestic banking system and reduce output growth in the region and also globally. Annual aggregate output growth has remained strong over the past year — at around 91/2% — but domestic demand has become somewhat more balanced.  The annual growth in real fixed asset investment has halved since its peak in 2004 Q1, while retail spending growth has picked up (Chart 1.69). Recent data, though, suggest that the imbalance in China’s external accounts is increasing.  The trade surplus rose to 41/2% of GDP in 2005 Q1, compared with 2%, on average, last year. Combined with strong capital inflows, this resulted in a further large increase in foreign exchange reserves, to US$660 billion (40% of annual GDP) in March — an increase of over $1 6 billion a month, on average, since December (Box 7). Moreover, the latest data show that the annual growth in bank lending, and particularly investment, remained buoyant in 2005Q1.  The continued strong growth in credit is likely to build up non-performing loans (NPLs) in the future, adding  to the current high stock — estimated officially to be  121/2% of loans, but much higher according to private sector estimates.(2) The most tangible impact of any slowdown in China on the  UK banking system would be via Hong Kong, where UK-owned banks have substantial claims, mainly on the non-bank private sector.(3) The economic recovery in Hong Kong has slowed somewhat since the middle of last year but, nonetheless, indicators of the strength of the banking system remain favourable.  Large capital inflows since the previous Review, seemingly associated with expectations of renminbi appreciation,(4) had until recently kept 48 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) See IMF Global Financial Stability Report (2005), Chapter IV ‘Company finance in emerging markets’. (2) For example, according to UBS, market estimates of NPLs remaining on Chinese banks’ books are currently around 25% of outstanding loans (‘How to think about China:  which way out for the banking system?’, May 2005). (3) However, UK-owned banks’ direct claims on China are also now growing rapidly — by 60% during 2004 (albeit from a low base).

Hong Kong interbank interest rates well below US rates.(1) Banks’ NPL ratio fell to 1.6% at end-2004 from a peak of 7 .6% in the aftermath of the Asian crisis.  And NPLs are likely to have fallen further this year, given the decline in the unemployment rate, and in mortgage and credit card delinquency rates (Chart 1.70). One potential vulnerability is the housing market, which accounts for over one quarter of domestic bank loans(2) and is a sector to which UK-owned banks have particularly large exposures.  By 2005 Q1, house prices had risen by 60% above their trough in mid-2003.  Mortgage debt service payments remain a low proportion of income at current interest rates (Chart 1.71)(3) but, along with house prices, would be sensitive to any sharp deterioration in the global financial environment.

Default-risk-free bond yields and forward rates have declined further since December.  Moreover, strong demand for credit exposure, the interest in domestic currency denominated emerging market debt, the rise in commodity trading and continued inflows into ‘alternative investments’ all suggest that investors’ appetite for risk remains significant.  So the possibility remains that investors may be mispricing risk.  Previous Reviews have identified two potential adjustment mechanisms.  First, credit problems may build up gradually if a sustained mispricing of credit risk has resulted in an over-accumulation of debt.  Second, there is the possibility of a sharp correction in asset prices, triggered, perhaps, by a generalised re-evaluation of credit risk, an unexpected rise in official interest rates in the United States or a reassessment of global current account imbalances, that could expose vulnerabilities among market participants.  There was, in fact, a period of stress in credit markets in recent months, initially triggered by concerns about General Motors and Ford.  This contributed to some re-evaluation of credit quality — credit spreads, particularly in high-yield sectors, have risen as has the cost of default protection for large complex financial institutions (LCFIs). The consequences in the structured credit and corporate debt markets following the events in the US auto industry illustrate how the crystallisation of apparently idiosyncratic risks can generate sharp movements in a broad range of asset prices.  This episode is illustrative of a more general possibility that asset price moves might be exacerbated further if leveraged investors with short holding periods are engaged in crowded trades or dynamic hedging strategies that dictate the selling of an asset when others sell (see Box 9).  In its financial stability work, the Bank, relying mainly on market intelligence, will continue to try to identify markets in which active traders are involved in dynamic hedging of positions, particularly when there are questions about the liquidity of the underlying market. Recent stresses in credit markets, and the possibility of an abrupt unwinding of the ‘search for yield’, highlight a number of challenges for participants in international financial markets: G for LCFIs, stress tests of market risks need to explore fully the impact of an unexpected exit of a large trader. There is the possibility that models used in assessing market risk may prove to be incorrectly calibrated, as illustrated by recent events in structured credit markets.  A sharp reassessment of the price of risk could place pressures on the future profitability of some LCFIs, which in recent years have been supported by strong returns from their trading activities; G hedge funds face the challenge of managing any mismatches between the liquidity of their assets and liabilities;  and G the rapid growth of new credit risk transfer products has contributed to delays in trade confirmations and assignments as back offices strive to keep up with the pace.  Difficulties ascertaining the nature and scale of exposures may impede the risk management of some firms should a credit event occur. The major UK banks are particularly active in debt capital markets, such as syndicated lending, leveraged loans and bond issuance, but less so in equity issuance.  The risk to banks’ capital from these activities depends on the extent to which exposures have been hedged or sold on — banks appear to retain material wholesale credit and market risk exposures.  Secondary market activities have also increased.  But measured trading book VaR and dealing profits are not very large as a proportion of income.  There may, however, be significant market risk in banking books, although the precise extent is hard to gauge.  2  Risks in the international financial system 2.1  International financial markets The market environment As discussed in previous Reviews, the uncertainties in the global macroeconomic and financial environment that have, for some time, preoccupied policymakers have not been as apparent in market indicators.  In particular, the implied volatility, derived from options, of a wide range of asset classes — foreign exchange, bond yields, equities — has remained fairly low (Chart 2.1).  Another puzzle has been the low level of future risk-free interest rates implied by government bond yields, which have continued to fall since the December Review (Chart 2.2).(1) Combined with continuing policy accommodation in a number of overseas G7 countries and modest returns on industrial-country equities, these unusual features of the environment seem to provide part of the backdrop for the ‘search for yield’ that has now been under way for some time.  It can be thought of as a generalised decline in the price of risk, as investors increasingly require smaller expected excess returns to hold risky assets.  Research in the Bank(2) and elsewhere tends to confirm that investor risk appetite has been higher than usual in the past two or three years (Chart 2.3). The search for yield’s most tangible manifestation has been the almost monotonic decline in credit spreads through 2004 and into 2005.  More recently, credit spreads have risen, prompted partly by developments at General Motors (GM) and Ford, and accompanied by disturbance in the structured credit markets. This has highlighted some useful lessons for risk managers and others in navigating their way through the possible asset price corrections that may lie ahead. Manifestations of the search for yield The search for yield is manifest across a very wide range of asset classes.  Just a few are mentioned here. Primary credit markets In the syndicated loan markets, gross issuance in both the United States and Europe has remained close to the record levels of 2004.  Leveraged-loan market conditions have been buoyant, with terms influenced by leveraged buy-out (LBO) activity sponsored by private equity funds(3) (Chart 2.4).

In the United States at least, data on the dispersion of leverage show that an increasing number of new deals were being issued with covenants permitting high debt-to-earnings multiples (Chart 2.5).  Debt-to-equity ratios have not reached the excesses of the late-1 980s, although early refinancings to extract equity via dividend payments are allegedly more common.  For financial stability, this is probably significant only if banks hold significant loan exposures.  There is some anecdotal evidence of that (seeChapter2.4).  But it has also been possible lately for dealmakers to distribute risky parts of the capital structure beyond the banking system.  In particular, hedge fund participation increased through 2004 and into 2005, via second-lien loans (Chart 2.6) and Payment In Kind (PIK) securities.(1) On the downside, this may have been one of the factors contributing to what market contacts widely regard as a degree of potentially excessive enthusiasm. Emerging market economies Declining risk premia in emerging market economy (EME) bond markets appear to have encouraged investors to extend into domestic-currency denominated bonds.  Issuance increased substantially over the past year (Chart 2.7), attracting both foreign institutional asset managers and hedge funds.  The development of domestic-currency capital markets is, in principle, positive, as they provide a channel for intermediation between domestic borrowers and investors without entailing foreign exchange risk.  And, for debtor countries, they create a mechanism for foreign currency risk on international capital flows to be borne by overseas lenders rather than by the EME borrowers themselves.(2) Indeed, contacts suggest that, for many international investors, explicit exposure to the exchange rate is one of their main motivations, involving a carry trade(3) and accompanied by more active trading of options on EME currencies.  Activity in some EME local capital markets, notably Brazil, is described by contacts as ‘crowded’. Meanwhile, equity prices in many EMEs have risen strongly, and there have been strong flows of capital into US mutual funds dedicated to EMEs — over US$3.5billion since the previous Review. Commodity markets Partly associated with rapid economic growth in some EMEs, notably China, the sustained rise in commodity prices seems to 52 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) PIK securities are a type of bond or loan that pays interest in the form of additional bonds/loans, instead of cash.

Active traders include hedge funds and investment bank proprietary desks.  For institutional investors, the motivation is generally described as to diversify portfolios via investments in, typically, commodity index-linked products.  One potential concern, however, is that increased trading and investing in commodities may, at least in degree, reflect a degree of optimism based on extrapolation of recent marked rises in commodities prices.  Speculative positions in industrial commodities traded on the US exchanges surged again during the latest period, most notably for copper (Chart 2.8). Institutional allocations to alternative-investment strategies In addition to investments in EMEs and commodities, long-term savings institutions continue to make asset allocations to other ‘alternative investments’ that have performed well in recent years, including hedge funds, private equity and commercial real estate. Net capital inflows into hedge funds during the first quarter of 2005 were US$24.6 billion, 50% higher than in the fourth quarter of 2004 (Chart 2.9).  And private equity funds continue to attract large commitments.  For example, venture capital and buyout funds in the United States have raised over US$2 1 billion in recent quarters — levels last seen during the technology ‘bubble’ in 2000. This seems to reflect a combination of a desire for greater diversification and a developing approach to asset-liability matching.  For some — perhaps particularly defined-benefit pension funds that are matching fixed-income-like liabilities with low-yielding bonds — this can take the form of a move to a so-called ‘barbell’ or ‘core-satellite’ approach to asset management.  In this, typically, the largest part of the fund is invested in (andperhaps managed passively against) a benchmark comprising amarket index or a portfolio tailored to the fund’s liabilities, witha smaller part invested in an actively managed range of strategies oriented towards obtaining high absolute returns.  Market participants increasingly refer to these two categories in terms of ‘beta’, to denote the systematic return from passively holding a market index;  and ‘alpha’, to denote excess return that derives from the skill of the active manager.(1) It is too soon to be clear about either the degree of diversification that alternative investments provide or their capacity to generate sustained risk-adjusted excess returns. Will the search for yield persist? Two broad sets of factors might help to explain the relatively low price of risk.  On the one hand, a plausible case can be made that the level of medium-term uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment has decreased.  Low and stable inflation, less The financial stability conjuncture and outlook — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 53 (1) See Box on the search for alpha, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin (2004), Autumn, pages 272–73. 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 1997 98 99 2000 01 02 03 04 05 US$ billions + – Chart 2.9 Net flows of capital into hedge funds(a) Source:  Tremont Capital Management, Inc.

In addition, financial innovation, particularly the development of credit and other risk transfer markets, has probably fostered greater dispersion and diversification of risk in recent years.  On this view, investor risk appetite may simply have increased to reflect reduced or better diversified risks. On the other hand, investors and others may not have adjusted fully to a lower inflation environment, instead comparing expected nominal returns with those achieved when inflation was higher.  A risk premium compensating for credit risk on a corporate bond is not comparable with the premium earned in the past on credit-risk-free bonds to compensate for a high expected rate of inflation.  Similarly, as risk-free real yields have fallen (Chart 2.10), it is possible that some investors have purchased risky instruments in an attempt to achieve the same real returns as could be earned on risk-free bonds a few years ago.  Some may also underestimate new channels for contagion created by innovative financial instruments, or may have unrealistic expectations about the ability of macroeconomic policymakers to offset shocks to the economy.  This second set of factors opens up the possibility that market participants are mispricing risk. Unless or until there is a decisive unwinding of the search for yield, it is extremely difficult to weigh the possible contributions of these two broad sets of factors in explaining the decline in the price of risk.  This, and the pervasiveness of the search for yield across a wide range of investors and financial markets, may mean that it is difficult for rational traders to eliminate any market inefficiencies in the pricing of risk.  Strategies designed to correct any perceived mispricing may be risky, costly and, given credit constraints, require longer holding periods than the vast majority of market participants are prepared to fund. Previous Reviews have identified two potential adjustment mechanisms that could possibly have implications for stability. First, credit problems may build up gradually if a sustained mispricing of credit risk has resulted in an over-accumulation of debt.  Conditions in primary loan markets are directly relevant to this.  Second, it has been possible for a while that, at some point, there could be an asset price correction in particular markets, which might spill over to other parts of the system — perhaps particularly if a number of leveraged traders were simultaneously to attempt to exit relatively crowded positions in less liquid markets.  Earlier Reviews(1) identified a number of uncertainties and sources of downside risk that might, if they crystallised, 54 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) For example, page 51, Bank of England Financial Stability Review (2004), December. 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 Jan.

They include concerns about the sustainability of the current pattern of global capital flows, particularly given the large external financing needs of the United States and the exchange rate policies of various Asian countries.  Foreign portfolio flows into the United States continue to be concentrated in debt instruments (Chart 2.1 1).  These include not only Treasury bonds but also, perhaps increasingly, bonds issued by the government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, mortgage-backed securities and, probably, high-grade corporate bonds, as foreign official investors themselves seem to reach for a little more yield.  The risk therefore remains that any reduction in foreign demand for these assets could affect their required return, with actual returns adjusting by some combination of a fall in dollar exchange rates and rises in the yields of these assets. A second risk remains the possibility of a more rapid tightening of US official interest rates than implied by current yield curves, perhaps prompting a more general re-evaluation of the current low level of medium and longer-term forward rates. And, third, the December Review identified that adjustment might come via the risk of a significant credit event precipitating a more general re-pricing of credit. Recent stress in credit markets There was indeed a period of stress in credit markets in recent months, initially triggered by concerns about GM and Ford. Together with a run of weaker-than-expected US macroeconomic data and speculation about possible LBOs releveraging some companies, the GM profit warning in March appeared to be the catalyst for both investment-grade and sub-investment-grade (or high-yield) spreads generally to rise somewhat (Chart 2.12).  The subsequent stress took a number of forms in different areas of credit trading and markets. First, some traders, including convertible bond arbitrage hedge funds, are thought to have had long positions in GM bonds against short positions in GM equity.  These positions would have suffered losses when, on consecutive days, GM’s equity price rose (following the announcement of Kirk Kerkorian’s tender for 8.8% of GM shares) and its bond prices fell (following S&P’s downgrade of GM to BB) (Chart 2.1 3).  Both events seem to have been a surprise to many market participants.  The downgrade, although widely discussed, came earlier than anticipated.  And, given that GM debt was trading at wider spreads than the average of B-rated bonds, at least some market participants may have expected its spreads to narrow — rather than widen further — once the uncertainty surrounding the downgrade had dissipated.

Changes in the relative value of these tranches should reflect market views on the expected co-dependence of credit defaults in the underlying index, so-called credit correlation.  For example, assuming a fixed expected credit loss on the entire index, an investor in an equity tranche would benefit if default correlation rose because greater bunching of those losses would tend to put the more senior tranches at greater risk.  So, in principle at least, levels of implied correlation should give some measure of the perceived balance between general credit risk (the clustering of credit events in a macroeconomic downturn) and idiosyncratic credit risk (caused, for example, by a major financial loss at a particular firm). In practice, however, the market in standardised tranches is still developing and market contacts have suggested that movements in implied correlation have been strongly influenced by supply and demand imbalances across tranches. The underlying reason for growth in the structured credit market over recent years has been demand to take risk on intermediate (mezzanine) tranches of bespoke credit portfolios by continental European and Asian banks, pension funds and life insurers, as part of the wider ‘search for yield’.  Creating these tranches synthetically for investors has left dealers having sold significant amounts of mezzanine credit risk.  In isolation, this position would incur losses in the event of a general narrowing of credit spreads and/or if the relative value of mezzanine tranches increased, usually associated with a fall in implied correlation. While the exposure to the general level of spreads can be hedged by selling credit protection on some or all of the names in the portfolios, hedging the correlation risk is more difficult. However, increasing liquidity has enabled dealers to hedge some of this correlation exposure by taking risk on the mezzanine tranches of the credit indices. Responding to this underlying hedging demand from the dealers, a popular trade for credit hedge funds and dealers’ proprietary trading desks has been to shed credit risk on mezzanine index tranches and take credit risk on the equity index tranches.

A higher price for credit protection indicates an increase in tranche risk, so the upfront price acts like a spread.  The financial stability conjuncture and outlook — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 57 Properly structured, the trade should allow funds to profit from both rises and falls in the overall level of credit spreads, as they have sold protection on the equity tranche, which is more sensitive to general moves in credit spreads — for a given change in value of the underlying index, the change in value of the equity tranche is 1 5–20 times greater.  But the trade is exposed to any fall in the value of the equity tranche relative to the mezzanine tranche, which shows up as a fall in implied default correlation. Some traders are said to have attempted to hedge this risk by buying large amounts of protection on the particular companies whose credit spreads they judged most likely to blow out. The ratings downgrades of GM and Ford (described in the main text) triggered a sharp fall in the relative value of equity index tranches in early May 2005, apparently as a result of an increase in perceived idiosyncratic credit risk (Chart A).  At the same time, the value of mezzanine tranches changed little or rose slightly. These contrary moves were reflected in a sharp fall in implied correlation (Chart B).  This ‘dislocation’ between tranches meant that traders with the position described above suffered losses on both legs of the trade. Market contacts have suggested that the sharp moves in spreads on the tranched indices may have been exacerbated by talk of hedge fund liquidations of positions, with dealers perceiving a ‘crowded trade’.  Movements in the values of bespoke CDO tranches were more muted, perhaps supporting the hypothesis that the sharp moves in standardised index tranches were amplified by closing out of speculative positions (Chart C).  In this respect, the episode is perhaps an example of how actual or rumoured liquidation of leveraged investors’ positions can exacerbate market stress, a risk that had been identified in previous Reviews.(1) However, actual flows are said to have been light. Since the period of stress in mid-May, spreads on the main CDS indices, and on the equity and mezzanine index tranches, have narrowed.  But implied correlation on the equity tranche has remained considerably lower than its average level before May (Chart D).  This might suggest that the events in early May have triggered a more sustained reappraisal of the risks embedded in the most risky index tranches, or that the movements did in fact reflect an underlying increase in perceived idiosyncratic risk.

Second, as described in Box 8, there were spillovers in the structured credit market, among so-called correlation traders — a relatively limited number (perhaps 20 or so) of hedge funds and some of the dealers.  Market contacts have suggested that this was exacerbated by rumours of liquidation of positions by dealers and funds, consistent with attempts simultaneously to exit from a crowded trade.  A number of lessons flow from this episode, as discussed in Chapters 2.2 and 2.3 below. There appears to have been some, but relatively limited, spillover to the high-yield bond and LBO-financing markets.  It seems that a number of LBO-related deals in the pipeline may have taken longer than otherwise to be completed.  And some of the riskier features of earlier deals — for example, payment-in-kind notes and second-lien loans — were said to have been more difficult to include. For a while, the high-yield primary bond market slowed markedly (Chart 2.1 4), against a background of sustained large net withdrawals from US high yield bond mutual funds (Chart 2.1 5) and uncertainty about the market impact of GM debt being added to high-yield indices.  Difficult conditions in the primary market might represent a risk for originating banks that end up carrying bridge loans on their balance sheets for an extended period.  But, most recently, high-yield issuance has resumed, with some heavily oversubscribed deals. There appears to have been only a limited impact so far on the EME asset class.  EME sovereign bond spreads fell to record lows in March, since when there has been a slight correction, especially for lower-rated bonds (Chart 2.1 6).  Contacts have suggested, however, that this owed more to a slight correction of spreads that were unsustainably low, even given the improvement in EME macroeconomic fundamentals, than to a direct spillover from the US high-yield market.  Whereas UShigh-yield spreads have risen by more than 100basis points since mid-March, EME sovereign spreads are relatively unchanged (Chart 2.17).  The suggestion that investors are discriminating more is given some support by generally declining correlations between US high-yield and various EME assets.  At current levels, however, EME sovereign bond spreads are still lower than predicted by some models based on fundamentals;(1) and similar comments about less footloose investors becoming involved in EMEs were made in the mid-1 990s. The episode of stress seems not to have triggered a flight to quality in ‘risk-free’ bond markets.  For example, there was no significant widening in swap spreads or in the spread between on and off-the-run Treasury bonds of the kind that characterised 58 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) As determined by a Bank of England model of emerging market credit spreads, detailed in ‘Understanding capital flows to emerging market economies’, Bank of England Financial Stability Review (2004), June. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 International US domestic US$ billions 2003 04 05 Chart 2.14 Issuance of high-yield bonds(a)(b) Sources:  Thomson SDC and Dealogic.

But there may have been some effect on the level of government bond yields, which fell during this period.  To the extent that this represented a reaction to macroeconomic data and revised expectations of the path of monetary policy in the main industrial economies, it may be largely independent of events in credit markets.  But a number of market participants have suggested the possibility of a link, with credit concerns spilling over into increased demand for risk-free assets.  In the course of unwinding credit carry trades, traders and hedge funds — the majority of which are domiciled in the Caribbean — may have closed out short positions in government bonds, or sold positions in risky assets and bought government bonds (Chart 2.1 8).  A similar point has been made about the rise in the US dollar in this period, which may also have been influenced by the closing out of short positions (Chart 2.1 9). Assessment of recent market developments At this short distance, it is difficult to judge the wider significance of May’s episode of stress.  To the extent that it has prompted a reassessment of some aspects of credit markets that reflected over-optimism, and has increased awareness and understanding of the management of risk in innovative financial instruments, it may on balance be positive for financial stability. Most recently, credit spreads — including those of GM and Ford — retraced some of their earlier widening.  Over the six months since the December Review, although lower-rated spreads have risen, higher-rated spreads are little changed.  The credit curve is therefore steeper (Chart 2.20).  And the recent decline in risk-free bond yields and forward rates may, conceivably, provide renewed impetus to the search for yield.  The outlook is uncertain. Also, it will be unclear for a while whether the recent unwinding of some credit trading positions has taken liquidity out of the market, in the way in which some commentators suggest the unwinding of Salomon’s  proprietary desk ‘arbitrage’ book during 1 998 exacerbated the spillovers from LTCM’s problems later that summer. It is clear, however, that May’s events have shed light on the possible dynamics of adjustment in today’s more complex markets, where optionality is commonplace.  As explained in Box 9, traders dynamically hedging short (sold) option exposures — buying or selling fractions of the underlying instruments based on movements in the value of the embedded option — may amplify movements in asset prices.  The development of traded markets in tranches of credit portfolios has added optionality to the credit markets, bringing potentially important changes in their dynamics.

They typically follow news about fundamental changes in macroeconomic prospects or the condition of individual borrowers.  But their scale and abruptness can also be influenced by ‘one way’ hedging flows causing prices to move away from fundamentals at least temporarily.  This is often associated with ‘active’ traders having been large net sellers of options, making them ‘short’ gamma (see below). In general, options positions (which might be traded options contracts, or economic options embedded in other financial products or trading strategies) are more likely to have a significant influence on market prices if: G They are large relative to the liquidity of the underlying market. G The positions of the ‘active’ options traders in the market, such as dealers and hedge funds, are unbalanced so that they are large net buyers or sellers of options.  In aggregate, options positions must balance, but in some markets ‘passive’ investors, such as households, are large buyers or sellers of options, usually embedded in retail financial products. G The options are at strike prices close to current market prices (near the money), so that they have high gamma (see below). If active traders are unable to balance their options books, they will typically hedge the residual position dynamically by buying and selling amounts of the underlying asset (adelta).  The intention is that the change in the value of the position in the underlying (ie the delta hedge) should broadly offset the change in the value of the options position for small movements in the price of the underlying asset. But larger movements require the trader to adjust the size of the delta hedge.  So-called gamma is a measure of the change in the size of the delta for a given movement in the price of the underlying asset. Gamma typically increases as the market price moves closer to the strike price, especially if the option is close to maturity, so that it is ‘nearer the money’.  If active traders have been net buyers of options, they will need to buy the underlying asset to adjust their delta hedge as market prices fall, and to sell as prices rise — they are said to be ‘long’ gamma.  In such circumstances, their hedging flows will tend to dampen asset price movements. But if active traders have been net sellers of options, and so are ‘short’ gamma, they will need to sell the underlying asset as prices fall and to buy as prices rise, tending to amplify price movements and therefore increase market volatility. Historical examples The following are examples where delta hedging of short options positions appeared to increase volatility: Portfolio insurance and the 1 98 7 stock market crash US institutions had, in effect, sold equity index options to investors hedged through so-called portfolio insurance — the formulaic selling of equities and buying of bonds as equity indices fell, often ‘hard wired’ through automatic trading programmes.  They assumed that they would be able to trade without affecting market prices.  But the scale of the hedging flows as market prices fell was sufficient to cause prices to fall significantly further. This was widely regarded as one of the key ingredients of the instability that accompanied the 1 987 crash.(1) Mortgage convexity hedging and US bond market volatility in 2003(2) The structure of the US mortgage market gives households a prepayment option on long-term fixed-rate mortgages.  Large-scale refinancing of mortgages in 2000–02 meant that most such options were in a narrow range of strike prices.  As long-dated market interest rates rose from these levels in the summer of 2003, those holding mortgage-backed securities or mortgage servicing rights were exposed to significant negative gamma as the likelihood of prepayment reduced.(3) Active hedging of this risk Box 9:  Market dynamics and options selling (1) See the Report of the Presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms 1 988. (2) Mortgage-related hedging was a significant factor in earlier episodes of US bond market volatility in, for example, 1 994 and 1 999. (3) See Boxes4 and 7 in the June 2002 Review for discussions of the structure of the US housing finance market and US mortgage convexity hedging.  The financial stability conjuncture and outlook — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 61 involved selling bonds or paying fixed in swaps as market interest rates rose, amplifying the price movements. UK life insurance companies and 2002 UK equity market fall Many policies written by UK life insurers have guaranteed minimum values at maturity.  At the time, many of the companies had large equity holdings, leaving them with a position similar to having sold an equity option to their policyholders.  As equity markets fell from 2000, some companies either purchased equity put options or sold equities in order to buy bonds (akin to dynamic hedging).(1) Such sales may, for a while, have amplified falls in UK equity prices. Current examples Current examples of unbalanced options positions may include: Structured notes linked to the US dollar/yen exchange rate Hedging of options positions embedded in so-called Power Reverse Dual Currency bonds issued mainly to Japanese investors in recent years is said to have left dealers as net sellers of options and therefore short gamma if the yen appreciated against the US dollar beyond around ¥90/US$.(2) Constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI) and funds of hedge funds Market contacts report increasing investment flows into hedge funds through funds of funds based on CPPI structures, which are a variant of portfolio insurance.  They involve automatic redemption of investments in funds if the overall net asset value of the funds in the portfolio falls.  The underlying hedge funds might, in turn, need to liquidate their own investments.  Potential preprogrammed deleveraging of this kind raises questions about the scale of the possible flows in relation to the liquidity of the underlying markets. Credit portfolio tranches This is an example where active traders have been net buyers of options, through the transfer of risk on intermediate tranches of credit portfolios to passive investors, such as regional European and Asian banks, pension funds, life insurers and, increasingly, retail investors.  Having shed risk on intermediate tranches, dealers are in effect long an option for movements in overall portfolio credit spreads because, as spreads widen, the value of their position increases in a non-linear way (longgamma).  If they are hedging this exposure dynamically, they will be sellers of protection on the names in the portfolio as credit spreads widen. Contacts have said that such hedging flows have tended to dampen volatility in market credit spreads at times over the past year.  But if traders take risk on equity tranches as well as shedding risk on mezzanine tranches, they are exposed to any increase in idiosyncratic risk in the portfolio ie if the credit spread on one or more of the constituents widens without a similar widening in the overall spread on the portfolio.(3) Dynamic hedging of this exposure requires them to buy protection on any troubled name as its credit spread widens, potentially amplifying the increase in the spread, while simultaneously selling protection on the other names in the portfolio in order to re-balance their overall hedge. Summary In its financial stability work, the Bank, relying mainly upon market intelligence, will continue to try to identify markets in which active traders have been large net sellers of options and are short gamma, particularly where there are questions about the liquidity of the underlying market. (1) See the Financial Stability Review (2003), June, page 1 9. (2) See Box 3 in the Financial Stability Review (2003), June, page 43. (3) See Box 8 in this Review.  In particular, the ‘bought mezzanine tranche protection against sold equity tranche protection’ position described in Box 8, meant that dealers and hedge funds would profit from broadly based changes in aggregate credit spreads (for a given level of implied correlation) but with an exposure to idiosyncratic risk — in sum, a long correlation position.  When idiosyncratic risk crystallised via the bad news about GM and Ford, they were forced to scramble to maintain hedges, exacerbating the movements in spreads and in implied correlation.  Their position in mezzanine tranches was the opposite of those investors that had sold mezzanine tranche protection.  Such investors typically include European and Asian regional banks, insurers and pension funds, which are said to seek mezzanine tranche credit risk partly as a way of diversifying their credit portfolios and also as part of the more general ‘search for yield’ (market participants commonly refer to them as ‘the structured credit bid’).  Most are thought to be ‘buy and hold’ investors.  It is possible, therefore, that they would not act in a way that amplified a generalised rise in credit spreads unless, perhaps, in an extreme scenario, they attempted to liquidate their investments. Market intelligence suggests that relatively recent developments in the US mortgage-backed security (MBS) market may also have reduced somewhat the risk of MBS convexity hedging exacerbating moves in the dollar yield curve, as occurred during disorderly conditions in 1 994 and 2003.(1) First, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two US Government Sponsored Enterprises, for the moment at least, have reduced or stopped expanding their MBS portfolios (Chart 2.2 1), and are believed to be hedging their negative convexity exposure more directly (eg via callable bonds and swaptions), and so delta-hedging less aggressively.  Second, it is thought that many relatively new investors in the MBS market, perhaps particularly foreign official sector investors, do not hedge their convexity risk — although it is unclear how they will behave if and when mortgage yields fall to the point that many MBS are called. As discussed in Box9, LCFI risk managers — and, to the extent feasible, the authorities — should do what they can to monitor the incidence of ‘structural’ short gamma positions among leveraged financial firms with short holding periods.  This is potentially important for stress tests that explore the impact of the unexpected exit from a market of a dealer or large trader. 62 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) Dynamic hedging of convexity embedded in portfolio holdings of MBS by certain market participants necessitated large-scale selling of US government bonds and entering into ‘pay-fixed’ swap transactions, causing yields and swap rates to rise sharply.

Compared with past returns, hedge fund performance has been relatively weak this year (Chart 2.23), although there are uncertainties about the quality of hedge fund databases (seeBox10).  Data for May suggest that while most strategies were profitable, convertible arbitrage, fixed-income arbitrage, multi-strategy and short-bias funds reported losses, consistent with some stress in credit markets.  However, there were no notable hedge fund failures, and prime broker market contacts have said that margin calls continued to be met. Some market commentators have, though, pointed to a risk of redemptions, which would potentially entail scaling back of positions.  To that extent, it is not absolutely clear that the consequences of the recent stress are fully played out.  Already in the first quarter, according to published data, convertible bond arbitrage experienced a net outflow, perhaps reflecting medium-term pressures from declining issuance of convertible bonds and from falling equity implied volatility reducing the value of the embedded options (Chart 2.24).  Market intelligence suggests that there has been some de-leveraging among funds, possibly as a safeguard against notices from investors to redeem at the end of the second quarter. Hedge funds are not unusual in being subject to redemptions of capital by investors (Chart 2.25).  However, their use of leverage, and the complexity and illiquidity of some of their investment positions, does necessitate careful management of any mismatches between the liquidity of their assets and liabilities. Funds employ a number of safeguards to manage redemption risks.  They include lock-ins, in which new investments in funds may not be redeemed for a set period;  redemption schedules, which set a precise schedule (eg monthly, quarterly) for any capital withdrawals, and minimum notice periods;  redemption fees, by which lock-ins and redemption schedules may be over-ridden, but subject to a discount on the capital withdrawn; and gates, by which a fund can limit the amount of capital withdrawable over a given time period (eg no more than 25% in a given quarter).  Beyond this, funds can also attempt to use indirect measures to manage redemption risk, such as limiting (or not accepting) capital from investors believed to be leveraged or to have short holding periods. Separately, for a while now, in an environment of intense competition among prime brokers,(1) some funds have  The financial stability conjuncture and outlook — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 63 30 20 10 0 10 20 30 Convertible arbitrage Dedicated short bias Emerging markets Equity market neutral Event driven Fixed income arbitrage Global macro Long/short equity Managed futures Multi-strategy Distressed Event driven multi-strategy Maximum-minimum range Interquartile range Median  2005 Q1 + – Per cent Chart 2.23 Performance of hedge fund strategies(a) Sources:  CSFB/Tremont and Bank calculations.

It is currently estimated to comprise over 8,000 funds with combined assets under management of over US$1trillion. Commensurate with this growth has been the increasing prominence of funds in financial markets and their significance to regulated financial institutions (largely through prime brokerage and their effect on market liquidity). Surveillance of the hedge fund industry is thus important, but it is not straightforward.  In practice, it involves analysis of industry trends (eg size, flows of investment, performance, leverage) supplemented by market intelligence (on both the hedge funds themselves and their prime brokers) and by regulatory information (including direct or indirect measures of exposure to the sector). There is little official data on hedge funds, so industry analysis relies on aggregates of data on individual funds.  This is available from private data specialists that collect data directly from funds and compile databases.  Outputs provide a guide to the size, growth and performance of the industry both as a whole and broken down by strategy.  The latter are produced in the form of indices, which assist comparison within the sector and between hedge funds and other investments.  However, hedge fund databases are subject to several limitations, which may mean that analysis based solely on their data is not robust. Biases in performance measurement Several biases(1) arise in the construction of hedge fund performance indices: G Survivorship bias occurs when considering the performance only of funds that are still in operation at the end of the sample period.  If funds drop out of the sample because of poor returns or the existence of ‘high-water marks’,(2) then the historical performance of surviving funds will be an upwardly biased measure of average performance.  Some data providers attempt to correct for survivorship bias by leaving extinct funds in their indices. G Self-selection bias arises because hedge fund reporting is voluntary.  Advertising or self-promotion can be an important motive for reporting to a database, providing incentives for some managers to report contingent on performance (eg a series of negative monthly returns may dissuade a manager from reporting). G Backfill bias arises if, when a new fund is added to the database, the historical performance is also imported.  Managers may tend to shorten the track record and provide only the most recent and most successful part.  Hedge fund database providers often attempt to eliminate this problem by not adding the historical data of new funds to the index. G Liquidation bias arises if disappearing funds do not report performance during the final periods prior to their liquidation.  Despite the fact that many data providers try to minimise this effect, it is likely that these funds may lose substantial value after the last report, giving rise to an upward bias. Index criteria used to determine the inclusion of funds (for example, requiring a minimum size or performance track record) limit the set of funds to which ‘industry’ performance is attributed. Analysis by Brooks and Kat(3) on the statistical properties of hedge fund indices shows that return distributions are not normal (Gaussian) and, in fact, are not symmetric.(4) In such cases, standard mean-variance analysis may be unsuitable and common performance measures such as the Sharpe ratio(5) (risk-adjusted performance) could be overestimated. Box 10:  Hedge fund data and surveillance (1) Most of these definitions are based on the research paper by Ackermann, C, McEnally, R and Ravenscraft, D (1 999), ‘The performance of hedge funds:  risk, return and incentives’, Journal of Finance, Vol. 54, No. 3, pages 833–7 4 and Lhabitant, F (2002), ‘Hedge funds, myths and limits’, Wiley Finance. (2) If a ‘high-water mark’ is present in a performance contract, managers cannot earn performance fees if the fund’s value remains below its peak (ie they must recover earlier losses).  Sometimes it may prove more profitable to cease operations and start a new fund. (3) Brooks, C and Kat, H (2002), ‘The statistical properties of hedge fund index returns and their implications for investors’, Journal of Alternative Investments, Fall, pages 26–44. (4) Their analysis shows that hedge fund indices exhibit negative skewness (values below the mean are fewer but farther from the mean than are values above, long left tail), leptokurtosis (extra probability mass in the tail areas, more extreme values) and show positive autocorrelation. (5) The (ex post) Sharpe ratio is defined as the mean excess return divided by the standard deviation of return.  The financial stability conjuncture and outlook — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 65 Other limitations of databases Several other factors affect the usefulness of the databases. First, coverage of hedge funds by individual databases is incomplete, mainly because of the voluntary nature of hedge fund reporting.  The majority of hedge funds seem to report to just one database (Chart A), and some do not report at all.  As a result, each database covers a distinct subset of the hedge fund sector and no database gives a complete picture. Second, there is no generally agreed definition of a hedge fund.  Databases therefore differ in their inclusion of investment vehicles.  Some, for example, incorporate commodity trading advisers (CTAs). Third, the limited level of disclosure by hedge funds may make it difficult to identify precisely the investment strategy followed by a hedge fund manager.  Some data providers review strategy categorisations periodically (‘best of style’ analysis) and may perform due diligence, while others may simply rely on the hedge funds’ self-reported style. But the risk of style drift — the tendency of a fund manager to alter the investment style over time — could result in misleading analysis. Fourth, information on changes in net asset value is provided at the discretion of the fund managers and is not always independently verified.  This is more of an issue for the valuation of assets that are infrequently traded, bespoke or highly complex, and so lack clear market valuations.  This could create discrepancies between actual and reported net asset values and lead to an underestimation of their volatility. Fifth, meaningful measures of leverage are absent. Few databases attempt to provide such information on a timely, periodic basis.  A major obstacle is the conceptual and practical difficulty in measuring leverage in the hedge fund sector.  As previous Reviews have highlighted,(1) this is due to both the absence of directly observable measures and the fact that leverage can take many different forms. Assessment Due to statistical biases, voluntary reporting and partial coverage, hedge fund data are subject to a number of limitations which may distort actual industry returns.  If these limitations are not widely recognised, there is the risk that surveillance will be impeded and a misleading impression formed of the hedge fund industry. (1) As discussed most recently in ‘Box 4:  Hedge fund industry leverage’ in the June 2004 Review, page 53. 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 4,000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Number of databases Number of funds Chart A Number of databases to which hedge funds and fund of funds report Source:  Strategic Financial Solutions, LLC Database Study 2004.  managed to agree extended margin lock-ups, under which a prime broker agrees to keep margin requirements unchanged for a specified period of time, conditional on the fund  honouring its obligations.  While this may involve some risk for prime brokers, it would help a fund to weather adverse conditions. Not all funds employ all of these safeguards, and smaller and newly established funds may well be in a relatively weak position to impose them — perhaps particularly on funds of hedge funds investors.  Increasingly, fund of fund instruments are based on constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI) structures, which automatically make calls on fund liquidity if performance across the fund of funds is poor (see Box 9).  However, market contacts suggest that many larger funds have been using a period of strong performance and investor demand to strengthen their liquidity.  If so, that may represent a positive development for financial stability, although the picture is unlikely to be uniform, as at least a few are believed to offer investors short-term, even daily, liquidity. 2.3 Large complex financial institutions Large complex financial institutions (LCFIs)(1) in aggregate remain highly profitable and measures of their financial strength have continued to improve.  Recent market developments have, however, highlighted some useful pointers for risk managers at LCFIs and other financial institutions active in international capital markets.  The price of default protection rose more for those LCFIs known to be active in prime brokerage or structured credit. Confirmation and assignments backlog The previous Review noted the fast pace in the growth of  credit derivatives and questioned whether back offices could keep up.(2) According to market surveys, growth picked up further in 2004H2 (Chart 2.26) and the backlog in trade confirmations continues to be a problem, notwithstanding industry efforts since the FSA’s caution last February (Chart 2.27).  Confirmation backlogs potentially leave firms vulnerable if they cannot ascertain the size and nature of their exposures when a credit event occurs.  According to market contacts, the problem is exacerbated by some hedge funds assigning trades to third parties without informing the original dealer.  If multiplied across LCFIs, hedge funds and into the 66 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) The December 2001 Financial Stability Review (Page81) described the criteria used to determine an LCFI peer group.

Initiatives in the vanilla credit derivatives market by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) and Swapswire should contribute to reducing the backlog, in conjunction with recommendations by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA).(1) Model risk Market contacts suggest that the recent disruption in structured credit market revealed shortcomings in models used to price structured credit products.  More specifically, some models had not been calibrated to allow for the magnitude of movements in the relative price of different index tranches, ie in implied correlation, that were observed in early May.  The inability to recalibrate models quickly (some contacts suggest the process can take days) and the lack of reliable price inputs exacerbated the problem, possibly leaving traders unsure of positions or required hedging ratios.  Model risk is not reflected in Value-at-Risk (VaR) measures of market risk. Market risk measures Using VaR, trading book market risk at LCFIs has continued to rise (in absolute terms), while remaining low relative to both profits and equity (Chart 2.28).  But, in addition to model risk, VaR does not easily capture liquidity risk, potential ‘tail’ losses(2) and all the ‘basis risks’ to which firms are left exposed by the intermediation of exotic financial instruments.  To get a better picture of risks, LCFIs are developing stress tests.  But the use of these techniques across firms is uneven, and stress tests are often based on previous episodes of market dislocation, rather than hypothetical events.  Also, firm-specific stress tests are unlikely to provide a complete picture across the financial system. Throughout 2004, LCFIs generated strong trading revenues for the apparent market risks they chose (Chart 2.29).  Several have benefited from high-trading volumes in fixed-income markets, associated with investors’ search for yield and the activity of hedge funds.  Recent performance has, however, been more variable and the outlook is uncertain. Legal and regulatory risks The extent of legal and reputation risks to LCFIs and their counterparties also remains an uncertainty, as discussed in the December Review.(3) Since then, further regulatory fines and civil settlements in the United States have underlined the financial impact of this risk.  Additionally, several non-bank firms, active in global finance and counterparties to the LCFIs and UK banks, The financial stability conjuncture and outlook — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 67 (1) The recommendations are detailed in the Strategy and Implementation papers of ISDA’s Operations committee, available on ISDA’s website:  www.isda.org.

Resilience Nevertheless, measures derived from financial statements suggest that the resilience of LCFIs continued to improve in 2004 (Chart 2.30).  Capital has increased and provisions remain low. One potential current concern is the relative weakness of the domestic operating environment for some LCFIs (see Chapter 1). However, the prospective impact on profitability is mitigated by geographical and business line diversification.  LCFIs generate high proportions of their revenues internationally, through foreign lending, financial markets and investment banking activity, rather than by taking domestic credit risk (Chart 2.3 1). 2.4 Implications for the UK financial system Non-UK LCFIs are important to the UK financial system because of their integral role in the functioning of both global and sterling financial markets and their direct links to many of the major UKbanks. The latest available data on the ‘large’ exposures of the major UK banks,(1) for 2005 Q1, demonstrate the materiality of counterparty credit risk.  Exposures to LCFIs were equivalent to around 85% of the Tier 1 capital of the major UK banks, up around 10 percentage points on six months earlier. Many UK-resident financial institutions also participate themselves in global markets through a range of activities.  In addition to the indirect links discussed in Chapter 3, these include origination (where institutions manage the issuance of financial instruments);  secondary market activity (where institutions trade on their own account or on behalf of clients); and their longer-term investment and funding activities. Origination One trend in recent years has been the effort by several major UK banks to expand their capital markets and investment banking divisions. UK-owned banks are particularly active in debt capital markets, such as syndicated lending, leveraged loans and bond issuance, but less so in equity issuance (Chart 2.32).  They have taken an increasing share of worldwide syndicated lending (Chart 2.33), ranking among the top underwriters in Europe and also being, to a lesser degree, significant participants in the US corporate loans 68 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) For regulatory purposes, ‘large’ exposures are defined as any exposures that exceed 10% of eligible capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital, less any regulatory deductions, eg related to insurance subsidiaries) at any point during the reporting period. 0 20 40 60 80 100 London foreign exchange International bonds Worldwide new syndicated lending Equity book running Major UK banks European LCFIs  US LCFIs  Other Per cent Chart 2.32 Major UK banks’ market share in selected financial league tables, 2004(a) Sources: Bank for International Settlements, International Financing Review and Bank calculations.

As described in Chapter1.2, lenders have been under pressure to allow less strict terms and conditions. The ultimate risk to financial institutions’ capital from these activities depends on the extent to which exposures have been hedged or sold on, which is difficult to assess.  Market contacts, and a few UK-owned banks’ public disclosures of their economic capital allocations, suggest that they retain material wholesale credit and market risk exposures. Secondary market activities Market contacts also suggest that major UK banks are increasing their secondary market activities.  The contribution of dealing profits to total income has remained broadly constant in recent years (Chart 2.34).(1) But this is the result of similar increases in both dealing profits and total income.  In nominal terms, both dealing profits and the value of market risk exposures, as measured by trading book Value-at-Risk (VaR), have risen since 1 999 (Chart 2.35).(2) But measured trading book VaR and dealing profits continue to remain low as a proportion of income for the major UK banks, both in absolute terms and compared with other LCFIs (Chart 2.36). As well as engaging in proprietary trading on their own behalf, financial institutions may also provide trading and settlement services to others.  Market contacts report that some UK-owned banks are competing aggressively for hedge fund prime brokerage mandates, especially in fixed income and credit.  Risk management may be compromised by competitive pressures so, as noted in the December Review, the challenge for prime brokers is to maintain robust risk controls in the face of such competition. Investment The major UK banks are also significant participants in capital markets as long-term investors through their participation in the insurance sector.  They own life insurance funds that take over a fifth of gross UK life insurance premiums and also own several major general insurers.  UK-resident life insurers, pension funds and general insurers are exposed to market risk through their asset holdings;  hence so are their owners.(3) The financial stability conjuncture and outlook — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 69 (1) Banks’ reported dealing profits will usually include income from both origination and trading activity. (2) The limits on the usefulness of VaR as a measure of market risk were discussed in Chapter 2.3. (3) Quantitative estimates based on market prices show that the main channel of contagion between major UK banks and UK life insurers is through banks’ direct ownership of life insurers.

Risks from capital market activities As discussed, the success of UK banks in developing the scale of their capital markets and investment banking activities may expose them to increased market risk.  There may also be significant market risk in financial institutions’ banking books, arising from mismatches between the maturities and interest rate terms of lenders’ deposits and lending.  While these risks are hard to quantify because of lack of uniform disclosure, limited disclosures by some institutions suggest that market risk is likely to be larger in banking books than in trading books.(1) Banking regulators have recently addressed the similar problem of measuring credit risk in banks’ trading book.  The Basel/IOSCO Trading Book Review, which is discussed in the article Strengthening financial infrastructure in this Review, has proposed a capital treatment for credit risk in the trading book that is consistent with the banking book treatment, while recognising the liquidity of trading book positions. 70 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) Public disclosures for one UK-owned bank reported that its ‘total’ VaR was three times that of its ‘trading’ VaR.  The financial stability conjuncture and outlook — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 71 3 UK financial sector resilience:  key points There continue to be few immediate concerns about the robustness of the UK financial sector.  The major UK banks remain profitable, well-capitalised, and liquid.  Reflecting these factors, market assessments of the robustness of the UK banking systems have remained positive since the December Review.  Despite the recent rise in credit default swap premia, the price of default protection continues to be at historically low levels and below those of most other major European and US banks. Further ahead, however, the UK financial sector faces several challenges: G the expected slowdown in lending growth and continued competition could place pressure on profit growth, increasing the reliance on non-interest sources of income for further growth.  These sources of income, which include asset management, dealing profits, and insurance broking, could be subject to greater uncertainty; G although banks have responded to the customer ‘funding gap’ — the discrepancy between the stocks of lending and retail deposits — by diversifying their sources of finance and lengthening maturities, some banks remain reliant on short-term wholesale markets.  An episode of market stress could, therefore, place some strains on refinancing channels; G the interbank exposures of the major UK banks are material, and include exposures to the major LCFIs. Shocks to one institution could, therefore, be quickly transmitted across the financial system.  Counterparty risks are likely to be exacerbated if there are concentrations of exposures to a small number of institutions; and G the tiered structure of payments and settlements systems in the United Kingdom means that the exposures between settlement banks and ‘second tier’ financial institutions need to be managed carefully.  3  UK financial sector resilience UK financial institutions’ lending (Chapter 1) and involvement in capital markets (Chapter 2) give rise to various forms of risk. The robustness of the UK financial system in the face of these risks depends on three main factors:  profits and capital to absorb any losses arising were these risks to crystallise;  financial institutions’ ability to manage their funding and liquidity;  and the inter-relationships between financial institutions.  The first two factors determine individual institutions’ resilience to shocks, while the links within the financial system (both between UK firms and to major global financial institutions) are one channel through which firm-specific difficulties can spread to the rest of the financial sector. This chapter focuses primarily on the major UK banks, a group of selected large banks, building societies and ‘other finance providers’ (as discussed in Box 1), but it also touches on other UK-resident non-bank financial sectors where they are relevant to the stability of the UK financial sector as a whole.(1) 3.1  Market assessment Financial market participants appear to have few concerns about the robustness of the major UK banks.  There has been a slight rise in the share prices of UK-listed banks since the previous Review, both in absolute terms and relative to the FTSE.  And measures of distance to default for UK banks(2) — inferred from banks’ equity prices — have continued to rise from already high levels.  This sanguine outlook is consistent with more direct measures of credit risk.  Although credit default swap (CDS) premia have risen slightly since the December 2004 Review, they are still low by historical standards and are below those of most other major US and European banks (Chart 3.1).  Credit ratings for the major UK banks are similar to those ten years ago and above those for many internationally active banks (Chart 3.2). Rating agencies have in the past noted that some UK-owned banks face risks from the extent of their reliance on wholesale funding.  In the past six months, however, the only ratings actions have been upgrades of some banks’ ratings outlooks, partly reflecting actions taken to diversify their funding sources (Chapter 3.3). 72 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) Alongside building societies and ‘other finance providers’, some of which are now part of the peer group of major UK banks, the December 2004 Review article ‘Assessing risks from UK non-bank financial sectors’ also identified insurers and securities dealers as potentially systemic non-bank financial sectors. (2) This refers to a Merton-style model, similar to that described in Bunn, P (2003), ‘Company-accounts-based modelling of business failures’, Financial Stability Review, December.  For the purpose of the model, non-equity liabilities are assumed to comprise only customer deposits. 0 1 5 30 45 60 7 5 90 105 120 1 35 Jan. May Sep. Jan. May Sep. Jan. May Sep. Jan.

(b) Moody’s Bank Financial Strength Ratings are a measure of the likelihood that a bank will require assistance from a third party, such as an official institution.  3.2  Profitability and capitalisation Profitability The major UK banks’ profitability remains high, with a median return on assets of just over 1% in 2004, up slightly on 2003 (Chart 3.3).  The median pre-tax return on equity for the nine listed major UK banks was 22.4% in 2004, up 1.3 percentage points on a year earlier.  Pre-tax profit margins increased in 2004, because of reductions in both provisions and cost-income ratios (as total income rose 10% and costs only 8%). However, investment analysts’ forecasts point to a slowdown in the growth in banks’ earnings per share.  Some bank chief executives argued at accounts presentations that current economic conditions were so benign that it was unlikely that household credit quality would continue to improve, or that household spending would continue to grow at the same rate; hence the potential for further growth in profits was limited. And, as noted in Chapter 1.1, more recent trading statements by some lenders have noted higher-than-expected credit losses for some forms of lending, particularly unsecured debt.  However, there is no indication that banks’ returns on equity are likely to fall sharply from their current high levels. If lending growth slows, that may intensify competition, putting further pressure on net interest margins.  Median net interest margins fell slightly over 2004 (mostly in the first six months), continuing a long-term decline.  Lenders attributed the recent fall in margins to competition and higher funding costs, but noted that the latter had eased in 2004 H2, as wholesale market rates moved closer to base rates (used to price most retail lending).  The decline in margins was, however, offset in 2004 by volume growth, and net interest income rose by just under 5%. If income from lending were to fall as lending growth slowed, the ability of the major UK banks to continue to increase aggregate profits would depend on the robustness of other income sources. Aggregate non-interest income rose by around 1 6% in 2004, and accounted for over 45% of the total.  Within non-interest income, the largest component — net fees and commissions — increased by 10%.  But the prospects for future growth in this category are uncertain, because it covers income from a wide variety of sources (including fees on lending and asset management).  Dealing profits rose almost 8%, reflecting some banks’ expansion of their activities in wholesale markets  (Chapter 2.4), but remained broadly flat as a proportion of total income (Chart 3.4). Although it accounts for only around 7% of the major UK banks’ total income, insurance underwriting was one of the fastest growing sources of income during 2004, rising by more than 60% in aggregate.  This large rise reflected some institutions’ The financial stability conjuncture and outlook — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 73 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1 998 99 2000 01 02 03 04 Interquartile range Median Per cent Chart 3.3 Major UK banks’ pre-tax return on assets(a) Sources:  Published accounts and Bank calculations.

But it also reflected banks’ expansion into the life and general insurance markets, and a general rise in life insurance sales — although industry activity was still over 8% below its 2002 peaks (Chart 3.5).  The rise in sales did, however, mask a continued decline in purchases of with-profits products, with a move towards unit-linked products, which have a lower profit margin. But unit-linked products also expose providers to less market risk, as it is passed on to policyholders. Capitalisation The major UK banks remained well capitalised at the end of 2004, with the median reported Tier 1 capital ratio broadly unchanged at 8.3%.  Even if non-prime capital instruments were excluded (as some carry debt-servicing obligations), capital ratios would have remained well above regulatory minima (Chart 3.6). Stress tests undertaken for the 2002 IMF Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP) suggested that the UK banking sector had a sufficient buffer of profits and capital to absorb losses arising from certain plausible but extreme shocks to the banking system.  An accompanying article in this Review discusses recent developments in stress testing, and reruns the stress tests used in the IMF FSAP — offering further evidence of the robustness of the major UK banks.(1) 3.3  Funding and liquidity The role of banks and building societies as monetary intermediaries — transforming deposits into illiquid loans — leaves them vulnerable to liquidity risk.  In common with any financial institution active in financial markets, they face market liquidity risk — the risk of being unable to execute a large transaction at prevailing market prices — as discussed in Chapter 2.  But they also face funding liquidity risk, as they need to refinance debt and meet liabilities as they fall due.  So, even when financial institutions are profitable and well capitalised, a sufficient stock of liquid assets is required to meet potential demands to repay their short-term liabilities. Funding The growth of the major UK banks’ lending to ‘customers’ (ie all non-bank borrowers) has been rapid recently (as noted in Chapter 1) and has exceeded the growth of deposits from this sector.(2) This has created a ‘customer funding gap’:  the stock of lending to customers exceeds the stock of customer deposits.

(c) ‘Customers’ comprises all non-bank borrowers and depositors.  many institutions, this gap was over 10% of total assets at  end-2004 (Chart 3.7).  It has primarily been funded by issuing debt securities, such as certificates of deposit (CDs), and borrowing in the interbank markets.  However, wholesale funding is typically more expensive, ‘lumpier’ and more volatile than retail funding.  It is also generally short-term (Chart 3.8) and therefore needs to be refinanced regularly.  In times of market-wide stress, or if a firm’s rating were downgraded, such short-term wholesale funding could prove more costly to roll over. Over the past year, major UK banks have increased the contribution that customer deposits make to their funding  (Chart 3.9).  This is consistent with some lenders’ moves to encourage more customer deposits, either through higher interest rates or increased marketing, although switching costs in the current account market may inhibit these efforts.(1) While the increase in customer lending still outpaced that of deposits last year, the difference in growth rates shrank (Chart 3.10). Previous Reviews have noted banks’ efforts to diversify their funding sources.  These have continued, with an expansion of wholesale funding operations outside the United Kingdom, and a lengthening of the average maturity of their debt security issuance (Chart 3.1 1).  For example, the major UK banks have issued £12 billion of covered bonds,(2) alongside more traditional forms of securitisation, such as residential-mortgage-backed securities (MBS).  The scale of such funding is still small compared with the combined balance sheet of the major UK banks, or the relative scale of the MBS market in the United States.  Some of these new sources of funding do, however, have potential implications for the ranking of creditor claims.  The FSA has therefore given interim guidance restricting the issuance of covered bonds because of the impact on depositors.(3) Further expansion of this funding source may, therefore, be affected by regulatory restrictions. Liquidity Financial institutions hold high-quality liquid assets to mitigate the liquidity risk inherent in their balance sheets.  Recent regulatory changes require banks to use an array of risk management tools, such as stress testing, to manage liquidity risk.(4) And market contacts report that the major UK banks place significant weight on the results of stress testing to assess how assets and liabilities would behave in extreme scenarios.  But these results are not publicly disclosed, so any assessment of The financial stability conjuncture and outlook — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 75 (1) Gondat-Larralde, C and Nier, E (2004), ‘The economics of retail banking — an empirical analysis of the UK market for personal current accounts’, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Summer.

Regulatory returns show that the major UK banks all hold sufficient liquid assets to meet the sterling stock liquidity ratio (SSLR), the regulatory minimum (Chart 3.12).(1) But the dispersion of SSLRs does suggest a range of styles of liquidity management within the peer group. The SSLR does not, however, address potential foreign currency outflows.  That limits its usefulness for assessing aggregate liquidity risk given that foreign currency liabilities represent about half of the major UK banks’ total funding.  Non-sterling liabilities and assets are broadly equal in aggregate across the sector, but some institutions’ foreign currency liabilities significantly exceed their non-sterling assets;  such imbalances are usually due to the use by institutions of long-term non-sterling debt securities to fund an increase in domestic lending, and do not necessarily indicate a significant liquidity risk.(2) The ratio of ‘liquid assets’ to ‘vulnerable liabilities’, as derived from data in published annual accounts, is an alternative measure of liquidity that includes potential outflows in all currencies, although it is dependent on the definition of ‘liquid assets’ and ‘vulnerable liabilities’ used.  This ratio fell slightly over 2004 (Chart 3.1 3), following a significant fall over recent years, as debt securities (which are the largest single component of ‘liquid assets’) have accumulated at a slower rate than ‘vulnerable liabilities’.  Despite the fall, the ratio suggests that major UK banks still have sufficient liquid assets to meet around three months of gross wholesale outflows. 3.4 Links between financial institutions Aggregate measures of resilience are insufficient by themselves to provide a full assessment of the UK financial sector’s ability to withstand adverse shocks.  Financial institutions are closely interrelated;  these links between financial institutions could allow a shock to one institution or group of institutions to be transmitted quickly to the financial system as a whole. Funding and trading exposures Counterparty exposures can arise through a variety of channels, such as by extending credit to or holding the securities of a 76 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) As noted in previous Reviews, the SSLR includes a proportion of banks’ holdings of CDs as admissible assets, which may not protect the banking system as a whole in the case of a system-wide liquidity shock.  However, even excluding holdings of CDs, the median stock liquidity ratio has remained above 100% since the December Review.

In total, gross interbank loans and advances were equal to more than twice these institutions’ Tier 1 capital at end-2004, up slightly on 2003 (Chart 3.1 4).  Such exposures not only include  lending between members of the peer group, but also to other UK-resident banks, such as the subsidiaries of internationally active banks, the large complex financial institutions (LCFIs) discussed in Chapter 2, and smaller UK-owned banks.  As noted in Box 6, around 30% of UK-owned banks’ ultimate risk foreign claims are against foreign banking sectors. Bank counterparty exposures can also arise through activities  off the balance sheet.  These include exposures through  over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, where positive  mark-to-market valuations of contracts expose financial institutions to counterparty risk.  However, netting and collateral agreements significantly reduce their scale.  In 2004, net OTC derivative exposures, which were little changed from 2003, continued to make up only a relatively small share of interbank exposures compared with direct lending between banks  (Chart 3.1 4). The major UK banks’ unconsolidated lending to UK-resident non-bank financial institutions has grown significantly in recent years, and exceeds their global consolidated interbank exposures (Chart 3.1 4).  But these data include intragroup lending not included in the global consolidated interbank lending data. Although exposures to ‘other finance providers’ are the largest component of lending to UK-resident non-banks (Chart 3.1 5), much of this lending is to group subsidiaries.  The other main exposure is to UK-resident securities dealers, which are subsidiaries of the LCFIs discussed in Chapter 2.3. ‘Large’ exposures Regulatory ‘large’ exposures data submitted to the FSA captures institutions’ total on and off-balance-sheet exposure to major counterparties.(2) It shows that, as well as exposures to each other, the major UK banks have significant exposures to LCFIs and internationally active banks (Chart 3.1 6).  However the pattern varies across institutions.  For example, exposures to LCFIs are more material for the larger UK-owned banks.  Similar large exposure data for the major UK-resident securities dealers show that their large exposures are primarily to other LCFIs, with some exposures to UK-owned banks. The financial stability conjuncture and outlook — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 77 (1) Data on the breakdown of financial institutions’ debt holdings of securities are, however, limited.  The major UK banks’ holdings of debt securities issued by their peers includes CDs, holdings of which are equivalent to around 33% of major UK banks’ aggregate  Tier 1 capital (for those banks that disclose such figures). (2) For regulatory purposes, ‘large’ exposures are defined as any exposures that exceed 10% of eligible capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital, less any regulatory deductions eg related to insurance subsidiaries) at any point during the reporting period. 0 50 100 1 50 200 250 300 350 1 998 99 2000 01 02 03 04 Gross OTC derivative exposure(b) Net OTC derivative exposure(c)  Lending to non-bank financial institutions(d) Per cent Interbank lending Chart 3.14 Major UK banks’ selected counterparty exposures relative to Tier 1 capital(a) Sources:  Bank of England and published accounts.

(a) Refers to peer group as discussed in Box 1, page 1 8.  Large exposure data also provide valuable information on the pattern of bilateral counterparty exposures.  The number of lenders that have large exposures to a firm may indicate its systemic importance.  At end-2004, the ten major UK banks had large exposures to 55 different counterparties.  Of these, 20 were counterparties for only one of the major UK banks (Chart 3.17). There were, however, 1 8 institutions to which five or more of the major UK banks had large exposures.  The institutions that appear most frequently on lists of large exposures are the major UK banks themselves and the foreign LCFIs.  The major UK banks are therefore linked closely to the major LCFIs, and risks can be transmitted between the two groups of institutions via counterparty exposures and mutual involvement in capital markets. Payment and settlement system exposures Many of the major UK banks participate directly in payment and settlement systems, both in the United Kingdom and overseas, giving rise to payment and settlement exposures. The two largest payment systems by value, CHAPS Sterling (the United Kingdom’s large-value sterling interbank payment system) and the embedded payment arrangements supporting CREST (the settlement system for many UK-issued securities) are  real-time gross settlement systems (Chart 3.1 8), so their operation does not give rise to credit exposures between settlement banks.  However, in both CHAPS and CREST, there are a small number of settlement, or ‘first tier’, banks and a larger number of customer, or ‘second tier’, banks which process their payments through the settlement banks.  Exposures can arise if first tier banks extend unsecured credit to the second tier banks for this purpose. The Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) system helps reduce foreign exchange settlement risk between system users by settling their transactions on a payment-versus-payment basis.  Values of foreign exchange transactions settled in CLS have continued to increase over the past few months (Chart 3.1 9).  Since the previous Review, the number of currencies settled within CLS has increased from 1 1 to 1 5, as CLS now settles transactions in the Hong Kong dollar, Korean won, the New Zealand dollar and the South African rand (see Box C in Strengthening financial infrastructure). However, comparing CLS volumes with estimates of total foreign exchange turnover suggests that many foreign exchange transactions are still settled outside CLS.(1) The December 2004 Review noted the interest of central banks and banking supervisors in whether banks are adequately managing the settlement risk that arises in those transactions not settled through CLS.(2) 78 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — The financial stability conjuncture and outlook (1) The BIS triennial foreign exchange and derivatives survey undertaken in April 2004 indicated that total daily turnover in the global foreign exchange market averaged some US$1.9 trillion.

Strengthening financial infrastructure — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 79 This article concerns measures to ensure that credit risk is managed in such a way that systemic risk is adequately mitigated. Central banks have long collaborated with supervisors on the design of prudential regulation as a tool for strengthening systemic stability.  We report here on the most recent output of that collaboration, the proposals of the BCBS/IOSCO Trading Book Review. Constructing arrangements to limit credit risks in payment systems also requires co-operation between central banks and regulators.  The article describes an arrangement agreed in April 2005 to protect the member banks and users of the United Kingdom’s major retail payment systems from potential systemic risk. The Trading Book Review The Trading Book Review (TBR) is the product of a joint working group of the Basel Committee and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).  Over the past year, this group has been reviewing the capital treatment of credit and other risks that arise from trading activities, as well as the treatment of credit exposures that are covered by guarantees or credit derivatives.  The working group has produced proposals that will bring the treatment of credit risk in the trading book into line with Basel II, and so bridge the gap between Basel II and the current trading book regime established by the 1 996 Market Risk Amendment (MRA).  The proposals (summarised in Box A) improve the risk sensitivity of minimum capital requirements, and place emphasis on internal models of risk. The TBR proposals improve the efficiency and effectiveness of capital regulation of trading activities; and they help to achieve one of the overall objectives of Basel II, by promoting improved risk management techniques.  This article discusses particular aspects of the TBR proposals that make an important contribution to the stability of the financial system, and suggests a direction for future work on market liquidity. Impact on markets for risk Previous issues of the Review have argued that financial stability can be enhanced by the greater dispersion of market and credit risk that is allowed by the growth of markets in such risks.  The regulatory authorities should seek to avoid inhibiting the emergence and growth of such markets, whilst also monitoring and mitigating the new risks and vulnerabilities created by new markets.  One welcome feature of the TBR is that it removes some regulatory obstacles to the growth of such markets. The TBR proposals introduce a new internal model approach to measuring counterparty credit risk associated with the use of derivatives.  It is based on the concept of ‘Expected positive exposure’ described in Box A, which is in widespread use in banks’ internal risk management.  This approach is a great deal more risk-sensitive than the existing one.  Not only is it sensitive to the potential credit exposure arising from any individual derivatives transaction, but also to the effect of the important risk mitigation techniques of margining and netting that operate at a portfolio level.  As such, at the margin, it makes more attractive the use of derivatives by market participants to manage risks. Markets in credit risk have facilitated the dispersion of credit risk over the past decade or more.  These markets take many forms, including securitisation and The continued stability of the financial system relies on robust infrastructure.  In particular, effective regulation of financial institutions and strong risk management within payment, clearing and settlement systems reduce both the likelihood and severity of episodes of financial instability.  This article describes recent developments on these fronts. Strengthening financial infrastructure  80 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — Strengthening financial infrastructure In June 2004, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) announced that it would be undertaking immediate work in two areas: (1) finding a prudentially sound treatment for exposures to ‘double default’;  (2) applying Basel II to certain exposures arising from trading activities. Given the interest of both banks and securities firms in these particular issues, the BCBS has worked jointly with the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).  The resulting set of proposals,(1) known as the ‘Trading Book Review’, were issued for public consultation during April and May2005 and final rules are being prepared in the light of comments received during this consultation period.  The proposals cover five areas: Counterparty credit risk The treatment of counterparty credit risk in the 1 988 Capital Accord is crude and insensitive to risk.  It estimates the exposure-at-default (EAD) in a position as the current exposure plus an add-on deemed to reflect the potential future exposure.  The Trading Book Review introduces two new, more risk-sensitive approaches to estimating EAD:  an internal model approach using the concept of expected positive exposure (EPE);  and a new standardised approach which is intermediate between the internal model method, and the existing approach. The EPE internal model approach estimates the distribution of mark-to-market valuations of future exposures to an individual counterparty by simulating the evolution of all relevant market risk factors over time.  It can take full account of margining and netting agreements.(2) An overall multiplier is applied to the output of the EPE model, to account for general model risk, and for particular risks that the model is known not to capture. Double default The Basel II framework allows firms to use the so-called ‘substitution approach’ for capital treatment of guaranteed transactions.(3) This approach does not capture well the economic risk of default. The Trading Book Review proposals identify a range of guaranteed transactions where there is a limited risk of a high correlation existing between the default of the obligor and the default of the guarantor.  For these transactions, a ‘double default’ treatment will be allowed.  Capital requirements will be calculated according to a simple formula that has been fitted to the output of an extension of the asymptotic single risk factor (ASRF) model that underlies the internal ratings based (IRB) approach in Basel II.  The extension estimates the probability that, in a macroeconomic downturn, both obligor and guarantor will default. Maturity adjustment The Trading Book Review has not made substantial changes to the treatment of short maturity exposures. There is some clarification of the scope of short-term transactions that qualify for some limited capital reduction on account of their maturity. Improvements to the current trading book regime The Trading Book Review seeks to improve the risk sensitivity of methods for assessing risks within the trading book.  The proposals follow the Basel II framework. The Pillar 1 changes aim to clarify the types of exposures that qualify for a trading book capital charge, provide further guidance on prudent valuation and stress testing, and clarify and strengthen modelling standards.  These include: G stronger, more explicit requirements for prudent valuation methods for trading book positions that take account, in particular, of the potential liquidity of the market for those positions;  and G an explicit requirement for banks using internal models for specific risk(4) associated with the credit Box A:  The Trading Book Review (1) ‘The Application of Basel II to Trading Activities and the Treatment of Double Default Effects’.  www.bis.org/publ/bcbs1 1 1.pdf. (2) Recognition of netting is subject to certain legal and operational requirements that are designed, inter alia, to deliver sufficient certainty over the legal enforceability of the agreements in all relevant jurisdictions.  The Committee does not consider that cross-product netting agreements currently meet these requirements. (3) Firms using IRB may adjust the probability of default or loss given default to reflect the benefit of the guarantee, provided only that the resulting capital requirement may not be lower than the requirement for a comparable direct exposure to the guarantor. (4) Specific risk is the risk of an adverse movement in the price of a security owing to factors related to the individual issuer.  credit derivative markets.  Much effort in the construction of Basel II has gone into a new, risk-sensitive treatment of securitisation.  The TBR proposals introduce the ‘double default’ treatment for credit risks that have been transferred by using guarantees or credit derivatives.  This treatment brings capital regulation closer to an accurate reflection of the ‘two-name’ credit risk that remains in such positions.  This should reduce the regulatory incentive to prefer ‘single-name’ to ‘two-name’ credit risk. The TBR proposals are a significant step towards supporting financial innovation by reducing regulatory distortions.  However, in calibrating both the counterparty credit risk and double default proposals, the working group has proposed conservative values for certain parameters in the underlying models.  This is a justified reaction to limitations of the data available for calibrating the models and uncertainty over their accuracy under stressed conditions, as was noted in the December 2004 Review.  But this conservatism does have an impact on incentives — ‘two-name’ credit risk is still subject to a harsher capital treatment than ‘single-name’ risk, relative to the risk indicated by the respective models. In future, firms and regulators will be able to improve the effectiveness of the TBR proposals by working to reduce the underlying uncertainties within the models, and hence reduce the need for conservatism. The ultimate goal should be to eliminate altogether the remaining regulatory distortions in the markets for risk transfer. Market liquidity and capital requirements A new aspect of the proposals for improvements to the trading book regime is that capital standards for individual risks held by a bank should depend on the liquidity of the markets for trading those risks — in short, the liquidity of those risks. The proposals are a reaction to the limitations of the soundness standard implemented by the Market Risk Amendment (MRA) in the face of the changing nature of risks in the trading book, and in particular the trend towards the inclusion of less liquid risks.  There is an implicit assumption in the MRA that firms will always be able to sell or hedge the risks in their trading books in a short period of time.  The inclusion of less liquid risks in the trading book renders this assumption unsound. In response to this, the TBR proposals include two new elements to address liquidity in financial markets. The first is a requirement for banks to make valuation adjustments, taking into account, amongst other factors, the potential costs of selling or hedging less liquid positions under normal market conditions. These include the consequences of being unable to sell or hedge within a ten-day period, and so having to bear market risk for longer than envisaged by the MRA.  The second element is a requirement that the assessment of internal capital adequacy, under Pillar 2 of the Basel framework, covers potential liquidity risk under stressed market scenarios. These measures will strengthen banks’ resilience to losses incurred on less liquid positions during normal and turbulent market conditions.  They are a welcome safeguard against the consequences of potential Strengthening financial infrastructure — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 81 quality of securities issuers to model default risk to a soundness standard consistent with that of the Basel II IRB-approach for credit risk, ie a one-year horizon and 99.9% confidence. The Pillar 2 changes seek to strengthen firms’ assessment of their internal capital adequacy for market risk.  To improve the robustness of trading book disclosures in Pillar 3 of the Revised Framework, it is proposed that banks also disclose, amongst other things, the internal capital allocation for the trading portfolio and the soundness standard used for modelling purposes. Unsettled and failed trades The Trading Book Review proposals set out a uniform treatment of capital requirements for unsettled and failed trades that seeks to reflect the credit risks they create, and to encourage orderly markets.  Higher capital requirements are required for transactions that are not settled on a delivery versus payment basis.  This reflects the potential credit exposure that could arise if a seller delivers a security but does not receive payment in a timely manner, or vice versa.  market dislocations of the type that have been identified in this and previous Reviews.  However, they do come at a price, which is the divergence of regulatory and accounting valuations, and a corresponding loss of transparency and increase in reporting burden.  This is one reason for seeking alternatives to valuation adjustments in the future development of regulation.  The remainder of this section presents a possible direction for future work on market liquidity and capital requirements. Consider the ways in which a firm can react if, as a result of a shock, its capital falls below the level needed to support the risks which it is currently holding.  In the short term, it can sell risks in risk transfer markets, in order to bring its capital ratio back to the necessary level.  In the long term, it can achieve the same effect by raising new capital.  It is implicit in the current regulatory architecture that the former reaction is desirable for trading book risks, and the latter for banking book exposures:  this is apparent in the very different assumptions about holding periods and confidence levels that are embedded in the MRA and in Basel II. From a systemic viewpoint, however, one of the goals of regulation is to safeguard the continued ability of the financial system as a whole to meet the real economy’s demand for intermediation between investors and borrowers, and other financial services. The risks that banks hold arise from intermediation: credit risk corresponds to intermediation between borrowers and investors;  the market risks that arise from trading activities reflect intermediation between individuals or businesses with differing risk preferences.  In the event of a shock or economic downturn, banks will decide between liquidating risks or recapitalising in order to be able to continue to hold risks.  The desirable reaction is dictated by the ability of other banks, or indeed agents outside the financial system, to take on those risks, and thus maintain the supply of intermediation. This is the link with market liquidity.  The liquidity of a risk is defined as the liquidity of the market that can be used to gain or hedge exposure to that risk. Risks are the fundamental objects that banks trade and manage.  Some of these risks arise from holding (or shorting) assets, many others arise from derivatives contracts.  Although the market in a particular asset or derivative contract might be illiquid, some or all of the risks that that position represents might still be liquid.  A seasoned interest rate swap, for example, is illiquid, as is the counterparty credit risk in it, but the interest rate risk in it is usually liquid.  The liquidity of a risk defined in this way can be viewed as a measure of the readiness of other agents (within or outside the financial system) to substitute for the intermediation function associated with that risk.  If a risk is illiquid, it is hard to find another bank (or agent) able to supply the corresponding intermediation function. Regulation therefore needs to control the probability that the firm will be forced, in response to a shock, to liquidate that risk, which means imposing a high confidence level and a long horizon.  If, by contrast, a risk is highly liquid, there are many agents, probably including many outside the financial system, who are willing to take on the risk, and provide the corresponding intermediation function.  Regulation need only ensure that the original firm is able to bear short-term market risk whilst liquidating its position. The liquidity of a risk is therefore a guide to the appropriate confidence level and horizon to apply for calculating capital requirements.  Indeed, although two extremes have been described, liquidity is not a binary variable:  it varies continuously across risks, and across varying market conditions.  A concern raised in The financial stability conjuncture and outlook in this and previous Reviews is that there is a class of risks which appear liquid under normal market conditions but for which the market is restricted to a limited number of financial intermediaries.  Under stressed conditions, such markets may become illiquid.  If the goal of regulation is that the financial system as a whole will be able to continue to hold such risks under stressed conditions, then a rather high soundness standard needs to be applied at the level of the individual firm to the calculation of capital requirements for such risks.  The extent to which that soundness standard differed from the stringent one applied to illiquid credit risks would depend on the extent to which regulators could have confidence in the maintenance of even a restricted market for such risks under stressed conditions. In summary, further consideration might be given to developing a common approach for both banking and trading book positions that uses the liquidity of a risk to determine the confidence level and horizon that should be used to calculate the capital requirement for that risk.  This approach would provide an 82 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — Strengthening financial infrastructure  alternative to valuation adjustments as a way of handling risks for which liquidity lies between the two extremes envisaged by the current banking and trading book treatments respectively. The beginnings of such an approach can be seen in the proposal that firms should adopt a consistent soundness standard for credit risk (equivalent to the 99.9% confidence and one-year horizon standard established by the Basel II internal ratings based (IRB) approach), whether the credit risk is held in the banking or trading book.  This is an important innovation.  It acknowledges that, whilst the particular credit risks held in individual trading books change frequently, when aggregated across all financial firms, the total amount of credit risk reflects a material contribution to the provision of financial intermediation by the financial system.  Capital held by the system in aggregate needs to be sufficient to support that continuing contribution. Managing risks in deferred net settlement systems: theory and practice Many of the world’s higher-volume payment systems settle on a ‘deferred net’ basis.  In these systems, all the payments over a given period are summed and only the net amount owed by (or to) a member bank is paid (or received) at the end of that period. Compared with immediate or ‘real-time’ gross settlement of each and every payment, deferred net settlement can be operationally more practical and can reduce the amount of liquidity that the member banks of a payment system need to allocate to that system.  One downside is, however, that banks receiving payments on behalf of their customers have often begun or completed the process of crediting customer accounts before they have received any net amount owed to them, thereby exposing them to risk vis-à-vis other members of the system. In the United Kingdom, settlement takes place on a deferred net basis in the BACS and Cheque and Credit Clearings (C&CC), for US dollar transactions in CREST,(1) for LINK, and for the Visa, MasterCard and Maestro card payment schemes.  For CREST US dollar transactions and, until August this year, in the Maestro scheme, settlement takes place on a bilateral net basis, with the net position between each pair of settlement member banks settled separately every business day.  For the other systems (and from August 2005 for Maestro) all these bilateral positions between settlement members are themselves summed to produce a single multilateral net position in which each member either has a net debit or net credit position vis-à-vis the other members of the system as a whole. Multilateral netting can reduce credit risk.  For example, if an insolvent bank was in a multilateral net credit position vis-à-vis the system, the other members of the system would collectively have no credit exposure to it.  Under bilateral netting, by contrast, at least some members could be creditors of the insolvent bank and would thereby have an open exposure. One difficulty with multilateral net settlement, however, is how to complete settlement in the event of a default by a bank in a net debit position.  In this situation, no pay-outs at all can typically be made unless there is a rule to determine how the shortfall in funds and potential loss arising from the defaulting member’s failure to pay will be shared across the system.  Irrespective of the size of the defaulting member’s debit position, settlement will fail.  Some banks expecting large net receipts may temporarily receive nothing because of even a small net debtor’s failure to pay.  If they were planning to use the incoming payment to meet their own obligations, non-receipt could expose them to liquidity risk. Failure to settle also gives rise to operational risk. There may, for example, be prolonged operational disruption if the system has to be closed until settlement has completed. These risks are, by their nature, systemic.  And it is for this reason that the CPSS Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems require that a system in which multilateral netting takes place should have an arrangement to ensure the timely completion of settlement in the event that the member with the largest single net debit settlement obligation is unable to settle.(2) A theoretically optimal loss-sharing arrangement There are three main ways in which it is theoretically possible to deal with a failure to pay by a net debtor in a deferred net settlement system. Strengthening financial infrastructure — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 83 (1) Sterling and euro transactions in CREST are settled gross and in real time rather than on a deferred net basis. (2) The CPSS is the Committee for Payment and Settlement Systems of the G10 central banks.  For further details of Core Principle V see www.bis.org/publ/cpss43.pdf and footnote 1 on page 86 of this Review.  Reversing credits to customer accounts Individual credits to customer accounts can, at least in theory, be reversed.  But even if this is possible under contractual agreements between the bank and its customers and applicable national law, reversing credits that have already been made is likely to be operationally difficult or expensive if a significant volume of transactions is involved.  It may also carry a high reputational risk for banks.  For these reasons, it is unlikely to be acceptable. Defaulter-pays models The defaulting settlement member can be made to pay in full (or in part) by requiring full (or partial) collateralisation of net debit positions.  If collateral is in a form which is sufficiently liquid even in a crisis, full collateralisation can effectively remove both credit and liquidity risk.  But depositing collateral has an opportunity cost, either because the member bank would not otherwise have chosen to hold the assets eligible to be used as collateral, or is unable to use these collateral assets to support other activity. Furthermore, in some net payment systems, it is not practical to put a limit on the size of net debit positions.  For example, banks do not have direct control over the total value of cheques written by their customers.  In such cases, it may not be possible to achieve full collateralisation.  In each payment system, there will be an optimal balance between, on the one hand, reducing risks by requiring collateralisation of positions and, on the other, limiting the opportunity costs of providing collateral. Survivors-pay models To the extent that net debit positions are not fully collateralised, credit risks remain.  If liquidity is needed to complete settlement, this must be provided from a source other than the defaulter, and the potential losses from the unpaid debit position will need to be shared in some way, normally between surviving members of the system.  Some different models for dividing losses are explored in Box B.  If losses fall on those members that have underlying bilateral net credit positions vis-à-vis the defaulter on the day of default, credit risk exposure may be concentrated on just a few members.  Alternatively, losses could be mutualised in some way, making exposures less concentrated.  To the extent that member banks are able to control their bilateral exposure vis-à-vis other members, mutualisation may, however, reduce the incentive to do so.(1) A practical solution in the United Kingdom’s BACS and Cheque & Credit Clearings In April 2005, the settlement banks in BACS and C&CC agreed a default arrangement — the Liquidity Funding and Collateralisation Agreement — covering these payment systems.  It has both a defaulter-pays and survivors-pay element.  The Bank’s Payment System Oversight Report 2004 describes how this Agreement will enable BACS and the C&CC broadly to satisfy some of the Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems.(2) The defaulter-pays element Each settlement member contributes collateral in proportion to a measure of the risk it brings to the BACS and C&CC systems.(3) The total collateral pool is sized so that it is equal to the largest of the aggregate debit positions of any member over the preceding year — currently a little over £2 billion. In practice, this means individual collateral pool contributions are sufficient fully to cover around half of each individual member’s observed debit positions, recognising the trade-off between eliminating credit risk and the opportunity cost of collateral.(4) The survivors-pay element In the event of one member’s failure to pay, each other member is contractually committed to provide ‘liquidity funding’ in order to allow settlement to complete.  Each member’s commitment is proportional to the measure of the risk it brings to the system, up to an individual cap which, when combined with that of other survivors, is sufficient to cover the largest aggregate debit position of any member over the preceding year.  In other words, the liquidity commitment is calibrated to the scale of the systemic risk, and each participant’s contribution is 84 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — Strengthening financial infrastructure (1) Some credit positions may, for example, relate to repayments on loans extended by one member bank to another, but in many retail systems the position is likely to reflect payments to a bank’s customers which the receiving bank cannot directly control. (2) www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/psor/psor2004.pdf — page 33. (3) The measure used is the average of the sum of each member’s net debit positions in both systems across all three-day periods in a preceding reference year (its ‘aggregate debit position’), plus one standard deviation.  The central bank, which brings no financial risk to the system, is not required to provide collateral. The Bank of England has, however, agreed to act as security trustee for the collateral. (4) By accepting a range of collateral that includes securities that many banks already hold in their asset portfolios, by setting this range more widely than that eligible for use to raise intraday liquidity to support payments activity in the CHAPS system, and also by ensuring that any eligible assets in the pool can continue to count towards end-of-day regulatory liquidity requirements, the opportunity cost of collateral has been kept low.  Strengthening financial infrastructure — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 85 Losses arising from a default in a multilateral payment system could theoretically be shared in any number of ways.  Charts A and B show simulated loss-sharing according to three feasible methods in a model system with member banks of different size (small, medium and large).  It is based on bilateral positions drawn from normal distributions.  The results from the repeated simulations are calibrated so that the maximum multilateral net debit position is £2 billion. The losses calculated assume that banks do not post collateral to cover their debit positions, so there is no element of defaulter pays. In the absence of any arrangement to share losses, it may be necessary to remove payments involving the defaulter and recalculate the multilateral net position among survivors only (‘unwinding’).  This negates the credit-risk benefit of multilateral netting and is likely to increase the aggregate exposure of surviving members of the system to the defaulter.  Charts A and B show that the largest losses occur under unwinding. Alternatively, the multilateral netting may be preserved and losses arising from the multilateral net shortfall shared in proportion to the defaulter’s bilateral net debit positions vis-à-vis the survivors on the day of default (‘bilateral positions’).  This preserves the credit risk reduction of multilateral netting, but can still result in an uneven distribution of losses.  In the worst cases in the simulations, banks of all three sizes lost only slightly less than under unwinding. The BACS/C&CC loss-sharing rule (‘BACS/C&CC rule’) incorporates an element of mutualisation.  Each surviving bank pre-commits to share in any loss in proportion to the risk that it routinely brings to the system even if, on the day of a default, it is not a net receiver of payments from the insolvent member.  The simulation indicates how the BACS/C&CC rule reduces the probability of large losses for individual banks in monetary terms as well as in proportion to capital.  The reduction in maximum losses for individual banks implied by this rule is considerable by comparison with unwinding or sharing losses according to bilateral positions.  This reduces the risk that a default in the clearings could significantly deplete the capital of one of the other member banks, thereby mitigating the systemic risk of contagion.  In terms of reducing systemic risk, the arrangement is superior to distributing losses according to bilateral positions on the day.

This approach has theoretical appeal.  It is also designed with reference to the benchmark recommended in Core Principle V.(1) Liquidity funding is called regardless of whether the defaulter’s collateral is sufficient to repay this funding.  This collateral would not be sold immediately as a more orderly liquidation is considered likely to result in a higher return than a ‘firesale’.  If the proceeds of collateral sale are sufficient to repay the liquidity funding, no credit loss is incurred by survivors.  But to the extent that collateral proceeds are insufficient to repay liquidity funding, survivors are left with a potential loss proportional to the measure of the risk they bring to the system.  Box B shows how this loss-sharing rule compares with other possible rules in terms of limiting systemic risk. The effects of the Agreement The Agreement helps to ensure that settlement could complete in the event of a default in the BACS or C&CC systems.  It thereby protects the public from the disruption the closure of these systems would cause.  By putting in place an element of defaulter pays, it mitigates the exposure of the member banks of these systems to credit risk.  As Box B shows, it also makes the exposure of individual banks to such a default less potentially uneven and volatile than with some other loss-sharing rules.  Although the size of net exposures in BACS and the C&CC is not on its own sufficient to threaten the survival of their member banks, exposures in these systems may be unpredictably high in a crisis situation.  Both for this reason, and because it helps to keep the payment systems open following a default, the BACS and C&CC Agreement reduces systemic risk. In designing the Agreement, the Bank and member banks of the clearings co-operated with the FSA to ensure that the risk-reducing arrangement, and the guarantees of liquidity funding that underpin it, do not incur a capital charge.  The Bank also worked with the FSA to ensure that assets held as part of the collateral pool could continue to count towards prudential liquidity requirements under current regulations.  This helps to reduce the opportunity cost of providing that collateral. Conclusions This article has described two areas where co-ordination and co-operation between regulators of financial firms, central banks responsible for financial stability and the oversight of payment systems, and the financial industry, has achieved positive results.  There are many other areas where such joint work is desirable.  Examples include: understanding the impact of liquidity regulation, including its effect on payment systems;  establishing arrangements for the effective regulation and oversight of firms that operate across borders;  and ensuring the appropriate management of foreign exchange settlement risk.(2) Taking these issues forward will continue to require effective co-operation between regulators and overseers, including in the relevant international committees, such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems. 86 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — Strengthening financial infrastructure (1) ‘A system in which multilateral netting takes place should, at a minimum, be capable of ensuring the timely completion of daily settlements in the event of an inability to settle by the participant with the largest single settlement obligation’. (2) Progress on some of these issues is reported in Box C, while more detail can be found in previous Reviews.  For a discussion of foreign exchange settlement risk, see the December2003 Review, page 91, and December 2004 Review, pages 86–92.  The June 2004 Review, page 69, considers how best to regulate and oversee financial infrastructure firms that provide cross-border services.  Strengthening financial infrastructure — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 87 Issue Significance Progress International Accounting Standards The use of a single set of modern accounting standards is likely to be beneficial to financial stability through enhanced transparency and market discipline.  A complete set of accounting standards is fundamental to ensuring reliable information is provided to users of financial statements.(1) On 1 9 April, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) voted in favour of a revised specification of the fair value option in the International Accounting Standard for the measurement of financial instruments (IAS 39).  The option allows certain instruments to be measured at fair value rather than at amortised cost.  As noted in the December 2004 Review, the European Union (EU) adopted a version of IAS 39 in November 2004 which included two carve outs from the IASB standard. The IASB decision should lead to the removal of the EU carve out which prohibits use of the option to fair value liabilities. European Union Capital Requirements Directive Bank capital requirements help to mitigate the moral hazard and externalities inherent in banking activities.  It is hoped that one of the major benefits of the more risk sensitive Basel II framework will be the strengthening of banks’ risk management practices across the EU. The Basel II Framework is being implemented in the EU through the Capital Requirements Directive (a recasting of two existing banking directives).  Agreement was reached among national finance ministries at the 7 December 2004 ECOFIN and the Directive text is now being considered by the European Parliament. In the United States, the results of a Quantitative Impact Study (QIS4) have led the regulatory agencies to postpone their Notice of Proposed Rulemaking scheduled for mid-2005.  However, the United States is continuing to target 1 January 2008 for final implementation. Definition of capital Ensuring the integrity of the capital buffer and working towards its common application across the EU represents a significant financial stability objective.  Effective capital design can help prevent losses from resulting in insolvency, enhances market discipline and protects insured depositors. The European Commission Working Group on Own Funds has started its preparations to be able to contribute to the Basel review of regulatory capital, which is expected to commence in Summer 2005.  The Working Group is considering what the guiding policy, principles and concepts behind the revision of the definition of own funds should be.  Technical and specialist advice will be provided by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors. Supervision of multinational institutions Ensuring effective and efficient arrangements for the supervision of cross-border institutions and infrastructure is central to managing potential risks as financial services markets become more integrated. Recent contributions to the debate on the appropriate model for supervision of cross-border firms have come from the UK tripartite paper on the EU financial services market,(2) a report on co-operative oversight by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems of the G10central banks(3) and the Commission's Green Paper on the Post-FSAP agenda.(4) Box C:  Update on initiatives in the financial infrastructure (1) The impact of accounting standards on financial stability was discussed in Michael, I, ‘Accounting and financial stability’ in the June 2004 Review.

The national authorities responsible for regulation and oversight of these central counterparties need to ensure the Group as a whole is managing risk appropriately. The eleven authorities, including the Bank and FSA, involved in regulation and oversight of LCH.Clearnet Group or one of its subsidiaries, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in February 2005.  The MoU establishes a framework for co-operation between the authorities to enable effective supervision and oversight while seeking to avoid unnecessary burdens on the Group as a whole. Bank of England provision of concentration bank services to LCH.Clearnet Ltd. The payment arrangements through which LCH.Clearnet Ltd collects and disburses the margin funds its members must provide involve the concentration of funds on unsecured deposit. Transferring the concentration bank role to the Bank of England will remove any risk that the concentration bank might itself be unable to provide funds in a financial crisis situation. The Bank and LCH.Clearnet Ltd have agreed that the Bank will later this year become concentration bank for LCH.Clearnet Ltd’s sterling and euro payments.  As part of the project, the timing for collection of margin payments from member banks has been tightened, reducing the duration of the central counterparty’s settlement exposures to its members and the banks involved in its payments arrangements.  By reducing unnecessary risk exposures of LCH.Clearnet Ltd, this benefits all institutions that seek to reduce risk by using the central counterparty. Co-operative regulation and oversight of the Euroclear Group The Euroclear Group comprises the national Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) for the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands as well as the international CSD, Euroclear Bank. The operational reliability of CSDs is fundamental to both financial stability and to the implementation of monetary policy operations. The new Euroclear Group corporate structure came into effect on 1 January 2005.  A Memorandum of Understanding for co-operative regulation and oversight of Euroclear SA has been signed by all relevant authorities including the Bank and FSA.  This framework is also being translated into a detailed programme of work, including monitoring of the two key IT projects being undertaken by the Group — the building of a Single Settlement Engine (SSE) and the development of the Group's data centres (both projects to go live in 2006). The Bank is working closely with CREST on the migration of CREST processing to the SSE, and with Euroclear and other affected central banks on the plans to integrate central bank money settlement of securities transactions within the SSE.  Strengthening financial infrastructure — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 89 Issue Significance Progress Co-operative oversight of SWIFT SWIFT is an industry-owned co-operative providing secure messaging services to over 7 ,600 financial institutions and 100 market infrastructures in 203 countries.  SWIFT is a fundamental part of the global financial infrastructure.  More SWIFT traffic is sent from the United Kingdom than from any other country. SWIFT is overseen through a co-operative arrangement involving all the G10 central banks and led by the National Bank of Belgium (NBB).(1) Between September2004 and February2005, the NBB and each of the other G10central banks finalised Memoranda of Understanding covering information-sharing arrangements and the relationship between them in respect of SWIFT oversight. Foreign exchange settlement risk and CLS The CLS (Continuous Linked Settlement) system significantly reduces settlement risk in foreign exchange transactions. Foreign exchange transactions involving four new currencies (the HongKong dollar, Korean won, NewZealand dollar and SouthAfrican rand) started settling in CLS in December2004, bringing the total number of currencies in the system to 1 5. The December2004 Review described how a large proportion of foreign exchange settlement was still taking place outside CLS.  Although there has since been some increase in participation in CLS and the values settled through the system, G10central banks continue to assess the case for further action to ensure the success of the G10 strategy to reduce foreign exchange settlement risk, and to take a particular interest in how this risk is managed for transactions that are not settled through CLS. Shorter clearing cycles The United Kingdom’s three-day clearing cycle for the majority of both electronic and paper-based retail payments is longer than in most other G10 countries.  In addition to benefits to bank customers, shorter clearing cycles would shorten the duration of exposures between settlement banks and so lower aggregate settlement risk. The banking industry has agreed, following discussion in the OFT-chaired Payment Systems Task Force, to reduce clearance times for certain types of electronic payments. A Task Force Working Group report, published in May,(2) identified demand for a faster retail payment service and recommended the introduction of a new same-day or next-day clearing cycle for certain payments.  APACS, the UK payments association, has established an ‘Implementation Group’ to determine how the new service will work in practice and report back to the Task Force by end-2005.  The industry plans to introduce the new service within a further two years of that date.

Moreover, historical episodes such as the Barings crisis in the 1 890s, the Latin American debt crises of the 1 980s, and the collapse of LTCM in 1 998 show that sovereign debt crises also have the potential to catalyse instability in the global financial system. The challenge in restructuring sovereign debts Restructuring sovereign debts to private creditors  has always been a difficult and time-consuming process.  In the absence of a formal restructuring mechanism, the process has evolved as the nature of the sovereign debt market has changed.  Private markets and the official sector have had to respond ‘on the run’ to specific problems thrown up by each new case. Any mechanism for restructuring sovereign debt has to deal with several inherent features of the market including: G limited ability to enforce debt contracts; G weak inter-creditor co-ordination;  and G information asymmetries. Each of these features is a matter of degree and is present to some extent in other debt markets as well. Box 1 explains the particular effects they have on the resolution of sovereign debt crises. In 2002, the IMF proposed the creation of a Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism (SDRM) to act as a formal resolution framework.  Several forms of the SDRM were developed, all based around the use of statutory powers to implement a debt restructuring embedded within an IMF programme.(1) When the SDRM failed to attract sufficient support, attention turned instead to enhancing market mechanisms in order to improve specific aspects of the crisis resolution process — the so-called ‘market-based approach’. Pursuit of the market-based approach, though, does not imply that the IMF has no role to play in resolving sovereign debt crises.  Indeed, since the onset of the 1 980s Latin American debt crises, official sector policies and actions have exerted significant influence over the incentives of sovereign debtors and private creditors, both before and during a debt restructuring. One objective of IMF programme support for member countries experiencing debt servicing problems is to overcome the inefficiencies created by the lack of an effective framework for dealing with sovereign debt crises.  In negotiations with a member over the conditionality associated with a programme, the Fund typically sets out the financial parameters for Resolving sovereign debt crises: the market-based approach and  the role of the IMF Paul Bedford, Adrian Penalver and Chris Salmon, International Finance Division, Bank of England Resolving sovereign debt crises occasionally requires renegotiation of debts to private creditors, typically in conjunction with an IMF programme.  Market mechanisms to facilitate debt renegotiations have improved in recent years but more needs to be done to make the process efficient and equitable.  IMF policies specifying the circumstances in which the Fund can lend set the context for debt restructuring negotiations;  these policies need to be improved before the market-based approach to crisis resolution can work effectively. (1) For an overview of the SDRM proposals, see Krueger (2002).  92 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — Resolving sovereign debt crises:  the market-based approach and the role of the IMF Enforcement The existence of any debt market relies on some means of ensuring that borrowers have an incentive to repay and/or creditors can recover value after default. Without this, creditors would refuse to lend, and the market would collapse. For corporate debt, contract law and domestic bankruptcy and insolvency procedures provide a legal framework for effective enforcement.  If a corporate debtor fails to repay, then its creditors can seize and sell the borrower’s assets, thus creating a powerful incentive to repay.  A sovereign state, by contrast, is not subject to a higher power that can transfer value from borrower to lender.  Using military force to support creditors’ claims (so-called ‘gunboat diplomacy’), as occurred in, for example, Guatemala in 1 91 3, is no longer acceptable.  An implication of this lack of a higher power, highlighted by Eaton and Gersovitz (1 981), is that it is willingness rather than ability to pay which is a defining characteristic of sovereign debt. Therefore, while an international bankruptcy court could establish a legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring, it would still lack the enforcement powers of a domestic bankruptcy system.  In practice, creditors have little difficulty in securing court judgements ordering the sovereign to repay after a default.  But enforcing these judgements is much more difficult because the principle of sovereign immunity severely constrains the ability of creditors to seize sovereign assets held in foreign jurisdictions. Litigation in foreign courts can, however, impose a financial cost on a sovereign debtor and act as an incentive to repay.  For example, a sovereign debtor may be forced to engage legal advisors or redirect international payment flows to avoid their seizure by judgement creditors.  A sovereign acting unreasonably should expect to face a large number of law suits. But, as in a domestic context, litigation is an inefficient way of applying market discipline because it imposes deadweight costs on both sides. This lack of contract enforceability has important consequences for the sovereign debt market.  It curtails, for example, borrowing on a collateralised basis because pledged assets have limited value unless they can be seized with certainty.  It is also very difficult, if not impossible, to implement a seniority structure in sovereign lending. Another important implication of limited enforcement is that sovereign debts are restructured by negotiation rather than adjudication.  The outcome of these negotiations is critically dependent on the relative bargaining strengths of the two sides, which in turn depend on the costs of not concluding a restructuring deal.  Other things being equal, the higher the cost to debtors of failing to secure a deal, the more advantageous is the bargaining position of creditors (and vice versa). In this regard, economic theory has struggled to explain what costs sovereign debtors incur when outstanding debts are not resolved.(1) Eaton and Gersovitz (1 981) argue that countries with unresolved debts are excluded from international markets and cannot borrow money to smooth out future shocks. Bulow and Rogoff (1 989) suggest that sovereigns with unresolved debts face restrictions on their international trade.  Cole and Kehoe (1 996) emphasise the wider costs to a sovereign’s reputation of breaking a contract.  Dooley (2000) rejects all these arguments, suggesting instead that it is the direct economic cost to debtors associated with default that gives the incentive to resolve debts. The question of why sovereigns repay and renegotiate is crucial because it sets a limit on what the official sector can do to alleviate the cost of a crisis. Interventions which raise the risk of default ultimately increase the cost of borrowing to the debtor and may lead to the exclusion from debt markets of sovereigns perceived to be high credit risk. Inter-creditor co-ordination The outcome of a sovereign debt restructuring and the efficiency of the process by which agreement is reached are also affected by the extent to which creditors can co-ordinate their actions.(2) Collectively, creditors are best off if a comprehensive Box 1:  Structural features of the sovereign debt market (1) Eaton and Fernandez (1 995) provide a comprehensive review of the literature on sovereign debt. (2) See Buchheit and Gulati (2002) and Haldane et al (2005a).  Resolving sovereign debt crises:  the market-based approach and the role of the IMF — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 93 resolving a crisis.  By endorsing a member’s policy programme, the Fund’s actions can also play a powerful signalling role. One crucial way in which the Fund influences the debt restructuring process is through its  lending-into-arrears (LIA) policy.  Until 1 989, IMF access policy prohibited the Fund from extending new lending to a country that had fallen into arrears on payments to other creditors.  However, this policy precluded the Fund from providing financial assistance even when a member was making every effort to restructure its debts and improve its repayment capacity.  It also effectively gave private creditors a veto over IMF lending. In response to concerns that this approach was unnecessarily restrictive, the IMF introduced, in 1 989, agreement can be reached in which the debtor agrees to pay the maximum amount consistent with  medium-term debt sustainability.  In theory, this could be achieved if a representative creditor with full information makes a ‘take-it-or-leave-it’ offer to the debtor. But individual creditors, acting independently, can have an incentive to ‘hold out’ during the restructuring phase in the hope of securing more favourable treatment once a deal has been agreed with the majority of creditors.  If the overall acceptance rate is sufficiently high and debt sustainability is restored, then the debtor may still have sufficient scope to pay a small group of  hold-out creditors in full on the original terms.   The debtor’s incentive to pay hold-outs in full is increased if the hold-outs can credibly threaten to disrupt or delay any deal through legal action.  In  all recent cases excluding Argentina (where it is too early to tell), debtors have found it prudent either  to re-open their offers or pay hold-out creditors in full. However, this is not a sustainable strategy.  If  hold-outs are paid in full, and those accepting take a hair-cut, then hold-out behaviour will increase.  The hold-out strategy is individually rational but (potentially) self-defeating because debt sustainability cannot be restored if the acceptance rate is too low. Creditors also have a collective interest to deny market access until a debtor has made an  acceptable offer.  But individual creditors have an incentive to lend if the interest rate is high enough because new loans are outside the restructuring process. Available information During restructuring negotiations, the bargaining strategies of a sovereign debtor and its creditors will be influenced by the amount of private information available to each party.  Sovereign debtors might know more about the future prospects for the economy and creditors might know more about the cost of undertaking legal action.  Rubenstein (1 985) shows that incomplete information of this kind can lead to prolonged restructuring negotiations because it is rational for both parties to attempt to exploit any informational superiority.  Both sides will attempt to use the outcome of each negotiation round to infer additional information about the preferences of the other side.  A sovereign debt restructuring is analogous to negotiating over the relative share of a pie which is shrinking.  At any point, each party wants the largest share that it can get but a bigger share for one comes at the expense of the other.  If the two sides cannot agree, the pie they are negotiating over will be smaller next time.  Each side must balance the prospect of a bigger share of a smaller pie tomorrow against what is offered today. Interaction The consequences of weak creditor co-ordination, lack of enforcement and limited access to useful information interact.  With no ‘shadow of the law’, the incentives to complete restructuring negotiations are weakened;  creditors may be less willing to accept an offer if they are concerned that ‘hold-outs’ will subsequently receive a better offer;  and information asymmetries can undermine mutual trust during a negotiation.  The expected outcome of a debt restructuring can also affect the probability of a crisis because creditors may be more willing to run if potential losses are high.(1) (1) The inter-relationship between ex-post debt restructuring and the ex-ante dynamics of capital flows is analysed by Haldane et al (2005b).  an LIA policy that allowed the provision of financial assistance in the presence of arrears under certain conditions.  The new policy had opposing effects on the crisis resolution process.  On the one hand, having a financial relationship with the Fund creates a commitment mechanism for resolving a crisis, compensating to some extent for the lack of enforceability over sovereigns.  On the other hand, the provision of financial assistance relaxes the liquidity squeeze the sovereign faces, possibly reducing the incentive to strike a deal quickly. There is, therefore, a complex inter-relationship between market-based restructuring mechanisms and the actions of the IMF.  The Fund lends, in part, because of deficiencies in the market.  But how the Fund develops a programme and the judgements it makes in implementing its LIA policy set the conditions for negotiation between a sovereign and its private creditors.  As the nature of the market evolves, the mechanisms to resolve crises and the IMF policies that support them need to be revised.  The challenge in recent years has been to develop a framework for restructuring sovereign debt in cases where bonds form a substantial component of outstanding claims.  Box 2 describes the conduct of a number of recent sovereign bond restructurings. The next two sections of this article briefly review recent developments in market mechanisms for restructuring sovereign debt and changes to IMF access policies.  The final section argues that, despite this progress, there is still further work to be done to develop a stronger framework for resolving sovereign debt crises. Recent market-based reforms When the SDRM was abandoned in 2003, the official sector hoped that the combination of market-based reforms, particularly to the contractual terms under which sovereign debt is issued, and the then recently agreed changes to IMF lending policies could facilitate efficient debt restructuring and strengthen the crisis resolution framework.  A G10 Working Group on Contractual Clauses was established to consider potential improvements in sovereign bond documentation.(1) Seven private sector trade associations also developed their own ‘model features’ for sovereign contracts.(2) As described by Drage and Hovaguimian (2004), these initiatives precipitated a number of contractual innovations that have strengthened elements of the debt restructuring process (these have, however, yet to be tested in a crisis). As is well known, the major developments have occurred in inter-creditor co-ordination.  The use of majority amendment clauses has been standard market practice for sovereign bonds issued under New York law since March 2003, and progress is being made towards introducing them into German law bonds in the near future.  These clauses effectively prevent hold-outs by allowing a super-majority (normally 7 5%) of bondholders to approve an amendment to the financial terms of a bond.  A creditor would thus have to purchase at least 25% of the bonds to gain a blocking position.  Acceleration thresholds, which limit the ability of individual creditors to initiate litigation against the debtor by requiring a minimum percentage of bondholders to agree to accelerate a bond, have also become a common feature of sovereign bond contracts. A limited number of recent bond issues have also attempted to improve creditor co-ordination by including engagement provisions.  These clauses formalise the process of setting up creditor committees by allowing a specified majority of bondholders to appoint a committee to negotiate on their behalf.  But the effectiveness of these committees is likely to be limited when, as is typical, they are limited to making recommendations to bondholders and do not have the power to commit to a restructuring deal. Aggregation clauses, which allow the contractual terms of a group of bonds to be changed simultaneously, can facilitate co-ordination across a much wider range of a sovereign’s creditors.  Uruguay in 2003 and both Argentina and the Dominican Republic earlier this year have included aggregation clauses in bonds issued as part of debt exchanges. However, market participants have yet to identify (or employ) a suitable means of introducing these clauses outside a restructuring.  One possible approach would be to establish medium-term note programmes; 94 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — Resolving sovereign debt crises:  the market-based approach and the role of the IMF (1) The Report of the G10 Working Group was published in March 2003.

Resolving sovereign debt crises:  the market-based approach and the role of the IMF — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 95 Since 1 998, at least seven emerging market economies — Argentina, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Pakistan, Russia, Ukraine and Uruguay — have restructured their international bonds.  Table 1 summarises the key features of these restructurings. In three cases, the restructuring was completed after the country concerned had fallen into arrears on its payments to creditors.  The remaining four restructurings represented pre-emptive actions aimed at restoring debt sustainability and avoiding outright default. All seven restructurings involved the country making an exchange offer.  Bondholders were given the opportunity to exchange their old bonds for newly issued bonds with lower net present value (NPV).  An alternative approach is to seek bondholders’ agreement to change the financial terms of existing debt instruments.  The introduction of majority amendment clauses into sovereign bond contracts governed by New York law should allow more restructurings to be concluded this way in future.(1) Several points can be observed from Table 1.  First, the reduction in net present value (NPV) has typically been greatest in post-default restructurings.  Second, the participation rate was lower for the three most recent exchanges, which might be explained by the fact that in earlier exchanges hold-outs had secured favourable (or at least no worse) treatment than bondholders who accepted the original offer. Recent bond restructurings have also differed significantly in terms of the process by which the countries concerned have reached agreement with their creditors.  At first glance, the universal use of exchange offers implies that a ‘take-it-or-leave-it’ offer from the debtor is standard practice.  But in several cases — notably Uruguay and the Dominican Republic — the launch of the exchange offer was preceded by a period of consultation between sovereign debtor and creditor representatives. The role of the IMF has also differed from case to case.  In Argentina, for example, the Fund adopted a relatively laissez faire approach.  But the level of IMF involvement in the six other restructurings described in Table 1 was much greater.  In each case, for example, the Fund provided market participants with at least partial information regarding its debt sustainability assessment or made some form of public statement concerning the financial terms of the restructuring.

The two-way flow of information between creditors and debtors has also been improved in recent years as several emerging market countries have established investor relations programmes.  Creditors have also gained more information through the IMF’s voluntary Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).  Since its launch in 1 996, 6 1 countries have signed up to the SDDS.  The use of information covenants in bond contracts, though, has not proved popular.(1) By contrast, there have been very few developments on enforcement.  Recent court rulings have limited the scope of sovereign immunity and rejected the champerty defence,(2) thereby slightly strengthening the hand of potential litigants.  The threat of litigation plays an important role in disciplining the behaviour of sovereign debtors, but uncoordinated litigation by a minority of hold-outs can also reduce the incentive of individual creditors to accept a restructuring offer and harm inter-creditor  co-ordination.(3) Not all the desirable elements of how a sovereign debt restructuring should proceed can be  pre-specified in bond contracts.  Over time, precedents are accumulated and become market conventions — the procedures followed by the London Club in rescheduling sovereign bank loans provide one example.  An important recent development in ‘soft law’ has been the Principles for Stable Capital Flows and Fair Debt Restructurings in Emerging Markets (hereafter, the Principles) agreed between some key trade associations and a group of sovereign borrowers.  The Principles constitute a set of voluntary guidelines designed to add further structure and predictability to the relationship between sovereign debtors and their creditors beyond that contained in contracts.(4) The Principles primarily address information provision and inter-creditor co-ordination.  They emphasise the importance of transparency and information exchange, calling on debtors to disclose all relevant macroeconomic information (in both normal times and, importantly, during a crisis).  Inter-creditor  co-ordination is addressed through a requirement for fair and equal treatment across creditors. In addition, by endorsing the Principles sovereign debtors informally commit to resolving any future debt crisis by entering into ‘good faith’ negotiations with private creditors.(5) This can be interpreted as an ex-ante attempt to strengthen enforcement. The voluntary nature of the Principles has the advantage of enabling countries to endorse behaviour which is difficult or impossible to codify in contracts. But the lack of a formal legal commitment also raises questions about the effectiveness of the Principles because there is typically relatively little cost in reneging on voluntary commitments (possible reputational effects notwithstanding). Recent changes to IMF policies In parallel to these two complementary market-based developments, there have also been changes in IMF policies.  In 2002, the IMF introduced the exceptional access framework (EAF) to specify the conditions under which the Fund will lend in excess of standard access limits.  This was in response to a small number of high profile cases, starting with Mexico in February 1 995, in which exceptional levels of financial assistance had been provided without a clear set of rules defining when this could be done. An important part of the EAF is that the Fund must conduct a debt sustainability analysis.  A member judged by the Fund to have unsustainable debts can only receive limited financial assistance once the process of restructuring its debts has started.  By making clear the limited range of circumstances in which large scale assistance can be provided, members should be encouraged to act pre-emptively to deal with incipient crises, both by adjusting domestic policy and, if necessary, undertaking a  pre-default debt restructuring.(6) (1) Uruguay has included information covenants in its bonds. (2) The law of champerty has the effect (where upheld) of prohibiting litigation in circumstances where the creditor concerned has acquired a claim with the express intent of pursuing litigation. (3) The best known example of a successful hold-out strategy is the case of Elliott Associates against Peru.  In 2000, Elliott obtained a Belgian court ruling that threatened to disrupt payments on restructured debt and encouraged Peru to agree an out-of-court settlement. (4) Additional information on the Principles can be found at www.iif.com/data/public/principles-final_0305.pdf. (5) However, the Principles define good faith negotiations in only the broadest of terms.  For example, they set out a number of guidelines for the operation of creditor committees, but do not specify the circumstances under which such the establishment of a committee is likely to be appropriate. (6) Countries that have undertaken pre-emptive debt restructurings in recent years include Uruguay and Ukraine (see Box 2).  In 1 998, the Fund’s LIA policy was revised to reflect the rising significance of bonds (relative to bank finance).  It was emphasised that a sovereign debtor must be conducting ‘good faith’ negotiations with its creditors before the Fund will provide financial assistance.  This policy was modified in 2002 in an attempt to provide clarity on the meaning of the good faith criterion. Crisis resolution — an unfinished agenda Improvements to the design of sovereign bond contracts, development of the Principles, and successive reforms to IMF policies have contributed to more efficient crisis resolution.  However, these initiatives have yet collectively to deliver sufficient strengthening of the framework for resolving sovereign debt crises. It is clear that the most significant advances have been made in inter-creditor co-ordination (albeit from a low base).  As the current stock of bonds mature and those which replace them contain, for example, majority amendment clauses, the process for restructuring sovereign debts will be considerably improved. There remains, though, significant scope for further contractual innovation to consolidate recent progress. At least two priorities can be identified.  First, there is scope for wider use of trustee (or trustee-like) powers designed to minimise the risk of disruptive or uncoordinated litigation.  Second, further analysis and discussion are required to identify ways of introducing aggregation clauses into sovereign bonds issued outside a debt restructuring.  There may also be ways in which contractual innovation can specify more formally the role of creditor committees.(1) It is important that contractual innovations are tried and tested in the market place.  But there is a collective interest in ensuring that progress continues to be made towards a more complete contractual framework for debt restructuring.  Trade associations have played an important role in this area and will continue to do so.  Public sector organisations also have an interest in maintaining momentum on the market-based approach.  As a contribution towards catalysing further progress on market-based reforms, the Bank of England hosted a workshop in January 2005 to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a range of possible contractual innovations (including aggregation clauses and trustees).(2) The recently agreed Principles are a complement to contractual provisions in shaping the practicalities of a sovereign debt restructuring and thereby clarifying the framework for crisis resolution.  In particular, the Principles have the potential to improve arrangements for information sharing between sovereign debtors and private creditors. But the Principles will need time to become fully effective.  In order for the Principles to become a wider market standard, more countries and more private sector bodies will need to make a commitment to them.  There is also scope for the content to evolve and it is welcome that the Institute for International Finance intends to keep the Principles under regular review.  Development of a mechanism to monitor compliance with the Principles could be particularly useful if it raised the credibility of the commitment. The combination of improvements in the contractual framework and the Principles could deliver significant gains in resolving sovereign debt crises.  But it is also important to address weaknesses in the design and implementation of IMF policies.  Recent reforms notwithstanding, the form of IMF engagement remains unpredictable, distorting incentives and weakening the efficiency of the debt restructuring process.  For example, uncertainty over the conditions under which the IMF will lend can encourage all parties to delay reaching agreement on a restructuring deal in the hope of inducing more financial support from the Fund.  Furthermore, the incentive for market participants to pursue and consistently implement market-based institutional reforms is weakened. There are two areas in which the clarity of IMF policies could be improved.  First, it is important that the Fund implements the EAF rigorously in all future cases.(3) In addition, techniques for assessing debt sustainability in uncertain situations should be strengthened.(4) A Resolving sovereign debt crises:  the market-based approach and the role of the IMF — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 97 (1) For example:  the conditions under which a committee could be formed;  its powers;  and the arrangements for recovering the costs incurred by the committee. (2) For a summary record of the workshop, see the accompanying article Bedford, P , ‘Design of sovereign bond contracts:  a workshop at the Bank of England’ in this Review. (3) Thus far, in all cases in which the EAF has been required, the member already had outstanding exceptional access from programmes agreed before the EAF was introduced. (4) See, for example, Ferrucci and Penalver (2003).  98 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — Resolving sovereign debt crises:  the market-based approach and the role of the IMF more complete understanding of the dynamics of private sector capital flows during and after a debt crisis also needs to be developed, such that the accuracy of IMF projections in capital account crises can be improved.  These initiatives should contribute to improved programme design and enable the Fund to make more selective and predictable decisions about the provision of financial assistance to member countries in difficulties. Second, the LIA policy should be reviewed.  As  recent experience has demonstrated, the 1 998 and 2002 reforms have not resolved previous uncertainties regarding IMF involvement in post-default restructuring negotiations.  In particular, there are concerns regarding the role  of the Fund in determining the financial parameters for a restructuring and the utility of the ‘good faith’ criterion. The traditional approach to IMF programming, which is embedded in the current LIA policy, involves the Fund and the member country agreeing on a common projection for key macroeconomic variables such as growth, inflation, the primary surplus, the exchange rate and the balance of payments over the programme period.  In cases when a debt restructuring is necessary, there is an important implicit assumption about the amount of debt relief the private sector must grant in order for debt sustainability to be restored.  Sovereign debtors have limited scope to deviate from these projections when negotiating with their creditors.(1) While possibly efficient, it is questionable whether this approach is tenable when the private sector is the main source of payment relief and is likely to provide most of the capital flow to a country in future.  Private creditors have a strong and legitimate interest in the trade-offs between IMF financial assistance, policy adjustment to increase future repayment capacity and debt restructuring.  In these circumstances, there may be a case for the Fund not to specify fully the financial parameters around the restructuring in the programme.  Instead, the parameters could be left partly open to allow the debtor country and private creditors to negotiate freely the amount of debt relief.  This reasoning was reflected in the IMF’s decision not to specify fiscal surplus targets fully in the programme agreed with Argentina in 2003. If the IMF followed an approach of not fully specifying the financial parameters of programmes in which there was a forthcoming debt restructuring, it could still publish its debt sustainability analysis.  The Fund would provide information to the market and its analysis could provide a ‘focal point’ for the restructuring. The operation of the good faith criterion in the Fund’s LIA policy also needs reviewing.  Given that no two sovereign debt crises are exactly alike, any criterion needs to have a degree of flexibility.  It also needs to leave scope for legitimate differences in bargaining positions.  The 2002 clarification of the good faith criteria was, though, so broad that it offered little operational guidance.  This raises the question of whether more specific criteria can be defined and, if not, whether the good faith criterion should be dropped.  There is a similar issue in relation to the Principles, which currently offer little specific guidance on good faith negotiation despite stressing its importance.  If more detailed and objective assessment criteria (for example, concerning the timetable over which key actions should take place) could be agreed between creditors and issuers, these could, in addition to being useful in their own right, help the Fund implement its LIA policy in a transparent and predictable manner. Analogously to the need for rigorous application of the EAF, it is important that these questions regarding the operation of the LIA policy are resolved. Both steps would enhance the predictability of IMF actions and the environment in which sovereign debtors and private creditors conduct debt restructuring negotiations. Conclusion Market-based mechanisms for facilitating sovereign debt restructuring are more likely to be developed if sovereigns and their creditors believe that how these mechanisms work has a material effect on the outcome.  Since 2003, there has been significant progress in improving market mechanisms to deal with sovereign debt crises.  The most obvious improvements have been the change in New York (1) Room for negotiation is narrowed even further if the member agrees with the Paris Club of official creditors on a debt rescheduling and accepts the requirement to achieve comparability of treatment with its private creditors.  Resolving sovereign debt crises:  the market-based approach and the role of the IMF — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 99 market practice to include majority amendment clauses in sovereign bond contracts and the development by a number of sovereign issuers and private sector trade associations of the Principles. Despite this progress, significant shortcomings remain and there is scope for further market-based innovation.  The design of sovereign bond contracts could be further improved in a number of areas. Market participants should encourage the wider adoption of the Principles and support further evolution to maximise their effectiveness. Furthermore, the official sector should aim to address current weaknesses in the design and implementation of the IMF’s exceptional access framework and its LIA policy to provide greater clarity and predictability to the Fund’s role in crisis resolution. Official and private sector participants should step back and resolve these important issues while global market conditions are calm and there are no major crises complicating the process of formulating lasting policies.  100 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — Resolving sovereign debt crises:  the market-based approach and the role of the IMF References Bank for International Settlements (2003), Report of the G10 Working Group on Contractual Clauses, March (available at www.bis.org/publ/gten08.pdf).

Sovereign bond contracts:  a workshop at the Bank of England — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 101 ON 12 JANUARY 2005, the Bank of England hosted a workshop on sovereign bond contracts.  The event aimed to facilitate discussion amongst market participants on whether and how innovation in the design of sovereign bond contracts could contribute to strengthening further the framework for sovereign debt restructuring.  Those attending included:  senior officials from emerging market issuers of sovereign bonds;  legal experts;  underwriters;  providers of trustee services;  and representatives of the investor community. Suitable arrangements for restructuring sovereign bonds allow sovereign debt crises to be resolved more efficiently and reduce the risk of such crises undermining the stability of the international financial system.  Furthermore, a protracted and disorderly restructuring process imposes  significant costs on both the sovereign debtor and its creditors.  The effective design of sovereign bond contracts can play an important role in ensuring that restructurings are concluded as efficiently as possible. Against this background, the workshop highlighted a number of areas where different interest groups hold broadly similar views and useful progress was made in respect of identifying practical measures that could be taken to improve upon existing contractual conventions.  It was also apparent, however, that there are other areas in which more fundamental differences of opinion arise and where further discussion is warranted. Impetus for change The workshop recognised that the recent shift in market practice to accommodate majority amendment clauses in sovereign bond contracts issued under New York law constitutes a significant step forward.(1) These clauses allow a super-majority (normally 7 5%) of bondholders to approve an amendment to the financial terms of a bond issue, and thus have the potential to act as particularly powerful instruments in facilitating orderly sovereign debt restructurings. Looking beyond majority amendment clauses, several workshop participants argued that there are a number of additional areas in which further contractual innovation could deliver tangible benefits.  Others noted, however, that there is a risk of attempting to move too quickly in this area.  For example, majority amendment clauses in sovereign bond contracts governed by New York law remain untested in crisis situations;  therefore it is not yet possible to assess with complete confidence their overall impact and effectiveness. Furthermore, there was general consensus that contractual innovation is not the only way in which the framework for sovereign debt restructuring can be strengthened.  In particular, there is scope also to pursue the non-contractual approach embodied in the recently published Principles for Stable Capital Flows and Fair Debt Restructuring in Emerging Markets (hereafter, the Principles).(2) Most workshop participants acknowledged that there is a basic complementarity between the contractual and  Improving the design of sovereign bond contracts is one way in which the arrangements for resolving sovereign debt crises can be strengthened.  In January 2005, the Bank of England hosted a workshop that allowed market participants to review recent developments in contract design and consider the case for further innovation.  This short article summarises the main points of discussion. Sovereign bond contracts: a workshop at the Bank of England Paul Bedford, International Finance Division, Bank of England (1) A comprehensive summary of recent developments in the design of sovereign bond contracts can be found in Drage, J and Hovaguimian, C (2004), ‘Collective action clauses (CACs):  an analysis of provisions included in recent sovereign bond issues’, Bank of England, November. (2) The Principles were published jointly by a number of emerging market issuers of sovereign bonds, the Institute for International Finance (IIF), and the International Primary Markets Association (IPMA) in November 2004.  See www.iif.com/data/public/principles-final_0305.pdf.  non-contractual approaches to facilitating efficient debt restructuring, but opinions differed in respect of the extent to which the Principles would have a material impact on the behaviour of sovereign debtors and their creditors. Types of contractual innovation The workshop discussed three contractual innovations that could improve the effectiveness of the sovereign debt restructuring framework: engagement provisions;  the appointment of bondholder trustees;  and aggregation clauses. Engagement provisions There was broad consensus that dialogue and structured negotiation between a sovereign debtor and its creditors can facilitate efficient debt restructuring.  Although some workshop participants argued that negotiations are not strictly necessary (on the theory that ‘take-it-or-leave-it’ exchange offers can be equally effective), others considered that the absence of a suitable channel for debtor-creditor communication is likely to increase the likelihood of creditors resorting to legal action and impose additional costs on all parties.(1) Views differed, however, on how constructive  debtor-creditor communication and negotiation should be achieved.  One option, advocated by a number of workshop participants, is to introduce engagement provisions into sovereign bond contracts. But other participants preferred to rely on a  non-contractual (that is, voluntary) approach.  In this respect, it is noteworthy that the Principles encourage both sovereign debtors and their creditors to negotiate restructuring deals in ‘good faith’. By requiring a sovereign debtor to negotiate with an elected creditor committee, engagement provisions can ensure that a single point of contact is established between the two parties.  But it was also recognised that these clauses are not in themselves sufficient to deliver effective debtor-creditor engagement.  A contractual requirement to negotiate with a creditor committee may have little substance if, as is typical, the committee does not have the power to commit to a restructuring deal.(2) On the other hand, it can be argued that a creditor committee appointed under the terms of a contractual clause is likely to have greater legitimacy than a committee established by means of a voluntary agreement between a sub-set of bondholders. A potential advantage of the non-contractual approach relative to the contractual alternative is that it would allow greater flexibility to address sovereign debt crises on a case-by-case basis.  For example, the use of engagement provisions could, at least in principle, lead to a situation where a debtor with multiple bonds outstanding is required to enter into restructuring negotiations with several creditor committees.(3) By contrast, a voluntary framework is more likely to allow for the establishment of a single committee tasked with representing creditors holding a range of different bond issues. Bondholder trustees The ability to enforce creditor claims through legal action makes an important contribution to maintaining the stability of the sovereign debt market by disciplining the behaviour of debtors.  But many workshop participants also noted that, from an efficiency perspective, co-ordinated litigation may be preferable to bondholders pursuing their claims individually.  Furthermore, there can be benefits from protecting sovereign debtors from aggressive litigation strategies employed by a minority of  ‘hold-out’ creditors intent on securing more favourable treatment in bilateral deals concluded outside the formal restructuring process. One possible means of addressing both these concerns is to appoint a bondholder trustee mandated to represent the interests of the full population of bondholders.  A trustee performs a role complementary to that of the fiscal agent tasked with managing (on behalf of the debtor) the process of making payments to bondholders.  The appointment of a trustee is standard for sovereign bonds issued under English law, but remains the exception for bonds governed by New York law. An English-law trustee holds an exclusive right to initiate litigation against a sovereign debtor in 102 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — Sovereign bond contracts:  a workshop at the Bank of England (1) Most recent sovereign debt restructurings have involved the debtor making a non-negotiable exchange offer to its creditors.  See Box 2 in the accompanying article Bedford, P , Penalver A and Salmon C, ‘Resolving sovereign debt crises:  the market-based approach and the role of the IMF’ in this Review. (2) A further consideration is how the costs incurred by the creditor committee are to be recovered.  Among the small number of recent issues to include engagement provisions, some have addressed this point directly, whilst others have not. (3) In practice, this concern may be more apparent than real.  For example, contractual engagement provisions could be designed in a way that allows for  cross-committee co-ordination.  respect of both accelerated and non-accelerated claims;(1) therefore bondholders (including potential hold-outs) are unable to take legal action individually. By comparison, the power of trustees under New York law is somewhat less extensive, with each creditor retaining the right to initiate litigation in order to recover missed payments (but not accelerated amounts).  The appointment of a New York-law trustee does not, therefore, eliminate the possibility of a sovereign debtor being subject to numerous legal actions initiated by bondholders acting independently. Both English and New York-law trustees are required to act on behalf of bondholders collectively. Accordingly, the proceeds of any legal action brought against a sovereign debtor must be shared pro rata among the full population of bondholders.  In effect, the appointment of a trustee introduces a type of ‘sharing clause’ into sovereign bond contracts.  Given this arrangement, a trustee can serve as convenient first point of contact for a sovereign debtor seeking to communicate (or negotiate) with its bondholders. Trustees also perform a number of other important functions in respect of sovereign bond contracts.  For example, an English-law trustee is typically able unilaterally to approve corrections to manifest error in bond documentation.  But there are also limits to the role of a trustee.  In particular, a trustee normally does not have the power to make commercial decisions on behalf of bondholders. The potential benefits of bondholder trustees notwithstanding, several workshop participants argued that there are in fact a number of alternative ways in which the design of sovereign bond contracts could contribute to reducing the likelihood of disruptive litigation.  For example, acceleration thresholds (through majority enforcement provisions) require a minimum percentage of bondholders to agree to accelerate a bond and therefore significantly constrain the ability of hold-out creditors to initiate litigation proceedings against a sovereign debtor.  In this respect, acceleration thresholds have the effect of narrowing the distinction between sovereign bonds for which a trustee is appointed and those issued under a simple fiscal agency agreement (that is, without a trustee). An acceleration threshold is not, however, a direct substitute for a trustee.  Under English law at least, the appointment of a trustee ensures that a sovereign debtor cannot be subject to multiple legal actions. By contrast, acceleration thresholds leave open this possibility;  in the event that a sufficiently large proportion of bondholders agree to accelerate, there is no (contractual) mechanism for ensuring  co-ordinated legal action thereafter. More generally, workshop participants noted that there is also an open question concerning whether protection against disruptive litigation would continue to be a material concern as majority amendment clauses become more prevalent in sovereign bond contracts.  Under the terms of these clauses, contractual amendments approved by a  super-majority of creditors holding a particular bond are legally binding on every holder of that bond. Consequently, post-restructuring legal action is unlikely to be a viable option. However, post-restructuring litigation is not the only legal strategy available to creditors.  Under the doctrine of merger (as recognised in some jurisdictions), judgement creditors’ claims fall outside the original contractual framework;(2) therefore individual bondholders may be able to pursue  pre-restructuring litigation as a means of avoiding the possibility of being bound by a restructuring deal concluded using, for example, a majority amendment clause.  Increased use of these clauses is therefore unlikely to eliminate fully the risk of disruptive litigation. Aggregation clauses In practice, the vast majority of sovereign debt restructurings involve a significant number of debt instruments.  An ability to aggregate creditor claims across multiple bond issues could therefore further improve inter-creditor co-ordination and allow more restructurings to be completed by means of amendments to the terms of existing bonds.  There are, however, currently few examples of aggregation clauses in sovereign bond contracts;  gauging market reaction to their use is thus difficult.  Nevertheless, some workshop participants forecast that the process of introducing these clauses would mimic recent experience with majority amendment clauses — Sovereign bond contracts:  a workshop at the Bank of England — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 103 (1) Following a missed payment, bondholders can, under certain conditions, accelerate a bond such that the full amount outstanding (principal and accrued interest) is payable immediately. (2) The term ‘judgement creditor’ refers to a creditor that has obtained a court ruling requiring the debtor to make payment.  initial scepticism followed by general market acceptance. It was also recognised, however, that there are many open issues regarding the most appropriate design of a contractual aggregation mechanism for  sovereign bonds.  One important consideration is to identify suitable creditor classes;  it would not be appropriate, for example, to aggregate across  secured and unsecured claims.  Defining creditor classes is potentially most problematic in the  context of pre-default debt restructurings  (where creditors would hold claims of different maturity).(1) Recent debate on the design of the aggregation clauses has been heavily influenced by the  approach employed by Uruguay and the use of  issue-level voting thresholds in particular.(2) It can be argued that a ‘true’ aggregation mechanism would dispense entirely with issue-level voting.   However, the thresholds used by Uruguay play an important role in mitigating the risk of a particular bond being included in a multi-instrument restructuring deal against the wishes of a majority of the holders of that bond.  In principle, this objective could be achieved using a 50% issue-level voting threshold, but Uruguay opted to pursue a more conservative approach by setting the threshold  at 662/3%. Uruguay first introduced aggregation clauses in a set of new bonds issued simultaneously as part of a comprehensive debt restructuring concluded in  2003.  Consequently, it was relatively straightforward  to define contractually the range of instruments  covered by the aggregation mechanism, a task that is likely to be more difficult where new bonds are issued outside a restructuring.  One possible means of overcoming this problem would be for sovereign debtors to introduce medium-term note programmes (thus establishing a means of issuing individual bonds under standardised legal terms).  Moreover, there was general consensus that, in a legal sense at least, the introduction of aggregation clauses into sovereign  bond contracts could be achieved in a number of different ways. Interpretation of sovereign bond contracts The workshop highlighted that there remain a number of unresolved questions regarding the legal interpretation of sovereign bond contracts, most especially in respect of the ability of creditors to recover payment due through the courts.  As noted above, litigation plays an important role in imposing a degree of discipline on sovereign debtors.  Yet market participants currently have only limited experience in this area — until relatively recently, legal action against sovereigns had been rare. Over recent years, however, there has been an appreciable increase in litigation proceedings against sovereign debtors, partly as a consequence of the rapid growth in bond issuance by emerging market countries.  Relative to the large banks that had previously provided the majority of emerging market finance, the population of bondholders is both larger and more diverse.  The shift towards bond finance has therefore introduced a broader range of creditor interests and made effective inter-creditor  co-ordination more difficult to achieve.  As a result, the likelihood of individual creditors resorting to litigation has increased. In addition, a series of legal precedents has contributed to an increased likelihood of creditors being able to secure court judgements ordering a sovereign debtor to pay — examples include rejection of the champerty defence(3) and restrictions on the scope of sovereign immunity. There is, however, a crucial distinction between obtaining a court judgement against a sovereign debtor and enforcing that judgement.  Attachment of sovereign assets has traditionally been very difficult, although some judgement creditors have recently been able to find creative ways of enforcing their claims.  One particular example is provided by the case of Elliott Associates versus Peru, in which the enforcement actions of the former led to Peru agreeing an out-of-court settlement. In attempting to enforce its claim against Peru, Elliott Associates employed a legal argument based upon a broad interpretation of the pari passu clause routinely 104 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — Sovereign bond contracts:  a workshop at the Bank of England (1) After a default, all creditor claims are accelerated and thus have common maturity. (2) A description of the aggregation clauses used by Uruguay can be found in Buchheit, L and Pam, J (2004), ‘Uruguay’s innovations’, Journal of International Banking Law and Regulation, January.  Near-identical clauses have been included in the new bonds issued by Argentina and the Dominican Republic as part of their debt restructurings completed earlier this year.

Sovereign bond contracts:  a workshop at the Bank of England — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 105 included in sovereign bond contracts.(1) However, most workshop participants considered the likelihood of this interpretation surviving further court scrutiny to be small.(2) Nevertheless, these participants anticipated that judgement creditors will continue proactively to seek alternative ways of enforcing their claims against sovereign debtors.  At least three possible approaches were identified: G appealing to ‘procedural’ (as opposed to contractual) pari passu arguments based on judgement enforcement laws; G seeking to attach the overseas assets of state-owned enterprises;  and G requesting international arbitration under the terms of bilateral investment treaties.(3) Although there is some precedent for the first approach to be successful,(4) workshop participants acknowledged that it is currently difficult to predict whether any of these enforcement strategies will prove to be viable over the long term. The workshop also noted the potential significance of litigation proceedings currently pending against Argentina following its default in 2001.  In particular, some creditor groups have employed innovative legal strategies in their attempts to recover payment — notable examples include the use of class action procedures and the initiation of pre-restructuring litigation.  Against this background, it is possible that a number of important legal precedents will be set over coming months. Looking ahead The workshop provided an opportunity for market participants to consider the significance of increased use of majority amendment clauses in sovereign bond contracts and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a range of other possible innovations.  In these respects, useful progress was made and a number of areas of common ground identified. The Bank of England believes that further innovation in the design of sovereign bond contracts could contribute to the development of a more efficient framework for resolving sovereign debt crises.  A companion article in this Review discusses the role of contractual innovation in the broader context of initiatives aimed at strengthening the framework for crisis resolution.(5) The Bank also recognises, however, that changes to existing contractual conventions will require the agreement of both emerging market issuers of sovereign bonds and the investor community.  Consequently, the Bank intends to build on the progress made at the workshop by continuing to encourage (and where appropriate facilitate) discussion amongst market participants. Welcome improvements to the design of sovereign bond contracts have been made over recent years. But it would be inappropriate to conclude that, for example, the introduction of majority amendment clauses represents a complete solution addressing all potential sources of inefficiency in the sovereign debt restructuring process.  Further contractual innovation, supported where necessary by other reforms to the international financial architecture, could support the gradual reduction of these inefficiencies. (1) A standard pari passu clause dictates that the sovereign bond concerned ranks equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the debtor. (2) Elliott Associates argued that the pari passu clause entitled it to a proportional share of any payments made by Peru on its (performing) external debt.  These payments were settled through the Brussels-based Euroclear system;  therefore Elliott Associates presented its argument to the Belgian courts.  A recent change to Belgian law means that it is no longer possible for litigants successfully to enforce judgements in this way. (3) Such arbitration could be initiated, for example, under the rules of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). (4) In 2001, the Democratic Republic of Congo agreed an out-of-court settlement with Red Mountain Finance after the latter had obtained from a Californian court a ruling with similar effect to that granted to Elliott Associates in its case against Peru.  The court ruled in favour of Red Mountain on the basis of its responsibility to aid the enforcement of judgements (that is, ‘procedural’ pari passu).

A major potential cause of systemic problems within the financial system is the possibility of contagious interactions between individual participants, notably banks, in the financial system.  This interaction can have many channels, for example direct counterparty effects when one of the parties fails, distress sales causing the market value of other agents’ assets to decline, cut-backs in lending causing economic depression and leading to failures elsewhere, and so forth.  Such interactions may occur directly amongst banks or between banks and other participants in the economy. Central banks and international financial institutions therefore want to develop models of the system which enable assessment of the risks of interactive contagion to be undertaken.  This paper reports on progress with one such model. This objective helps to define the characteristics that such models should ideally possess.  We list these below: Default An important element in contagion is the possibility of default, and it is essential that a model exploring contagion should include default.  This is intellectually challenging.  Models cannot easily handle the discontinuous, non-linear, functions that are involved and indeed most extant macroeconomic models in effect exclude default.  But that is not an option for a model of contagion.  After all, if it were certain that everyone would repay all their debts in full, including accumulated interest, everyone could borrow, or lend, without credit risk.  There would be no need for financial intermediaries, such as banks, whose role is predicated in some large part both on their customers’ faith in their banks’ creditworthiness and on banks’ abilities to assess the creditworthiness of their customers. Incomplete markets Another important aspect of the real world is that markets are incomplete — not every eventuality can be hedged.  Unforeseen, and unhedged, events are often a feature of the onset and propagation of crises. When some financial markets are missing, or otherwise imperfect, there can be a role for regulating intermediation.(1) Even so, it is important to be clear in what particular respects the system of financial markets is incomplete. Roles for money, banks, liquidity and default risk It is essential for a model exploring systemic risk to include default risk and/or the incompleteness of financial markets.  After all, in the absence of these factors there would be no essential need for money, This article outlines the results of a programme of research, undertaken within the Bank, to try to develop a theoretically rigorous, but also an empirically tractable, model of the banking system.  The Bank of England, in conjunction with HM Treasury and the Financial Services Authority, is responsible for maintaining systemic stability. The possibility of contagious failures between banks and their borrowers could be a major threat to such stability.  In order to assess such dangers, a model for the analysis of financial stability needs to include amongst its characteristics heterogeneous agents, in the form of banks and their customers, and the possibility of default. (1) Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis (1 985) show that, with incomplete asset markets, the economy may even fail to reach the second-best, ie constrained  Pareto-optimality.  In such a case, policy intervention may induce welfare improvements. A model to analyse  financial fragility Charles A E Goodhart, London School of Economics, Financial Markets Group, Lea Zicchino, Financial Industry and Regulation Division,  Bank of England  no need for banks, and while there would still be a real interest rate, determined by time preference and expected returns to investment, there would be no essential role for either liquidity or default premia in the determination of interest rates. Heterogeneous agents If all banks were assumed to be identical, then they would never have an incentive to trade with each other.  Since direct interactions between banks, notably, but not only, in the interbank markets, are often viewed as a key channel of financial contagion, an assumption that all banks were identical, or equivalently that the banking system can be modelled as consisting of a single representative bank, excludes a main potential channel of contagious interaction. In any case the assumption that all banks, or bank customers, are identical is hardly realistic;  while it can be a useful simplification for some purposes, it cannot be so for a study of contagion.  Also, interaction amongst agents or banks should not be imposed exogenously but should ideally be an outcome of optimal behaviour. Structural microfoundations There are, of course, in any major field a wide range of potential models.  This is the case in the study of financial stability.  Some start by examining the data in order to perceive and to estimate the likelihood of defaults in individual banks, or even systemic financial crises, from other predetermined variables, such as the market value of banks’ equity  (Merton-type models) or subordinated debt, or the rate of growth of bank loans, or from macroeconomic data more widely.  Such models have the advantage of congruence with the data, which is important from a surveillance perspective, but they can be subject to the Lucas critique (and Goodhart’s Law)(1) that such regularities may break down as the (policy) regime changes. At the other end of the spectrum, one can start by trying to establish models based on optimising microfoundations.  The complexity of human behaviour and the wide and diverse scope of the economy imply, however, that not only do such models require simplifying assumptions that are extreme, but also that they will typically have less congruence with the data (than other, more atheoretical, data-fitting models). Indeed one can position one’s research at any point along the efficient frontier between data congruence and theoretical coherence.  The programme of work reported here lies towards the more theoretical end of this frontier. Empirically tractable While the above characteristics will be desirable in constructing a satisfactory theoretical model of contagious interaction, such a model will have little lasting practical effect unless it can be used empirically by regulators to assess systemic financial fragility, using real data.  That means that it must also be empirically tractable.  But the above characteristics do also make for complexity in empirical estimation.  As noted already, there is an inevitable trade-off between including desirable theoretical features and complexity.  One possibility would be to construct a suite of models at different points on the trade-off.  The trade-off may, however, be made less stark by designing a model structure which is flexible enough to switch focus from one practical issue to another, and so only include those elements of the wider model necessary to handle the question at hand. In the next section we provide a brief survey of  the literature, and assess some current models  against the criteria set out above.  Then we briefly report the form of the model on which we have been working, indicating the main results from this work. The model is designed to simulate how financial fragility is affected by a potentially wide menu  of shocks.  One example of such a simulation is  given.  Possible extensions of this work are also reported. A review of models to assess financial fragility Turning first to the more empirical exercises, most of such studies of the vulnerability of banks, and indeed of banking systems, have concentrated on assessment of the conditions of individual banks or the financial system treated as a single representative entity. Hoggarth and Whitley (2003) and Tudela and  Young (2003) are excellent examples of this genre. While such studies of individual institutions remain a necessary and essential part of any analysis of financial conditions, they do have certain inherent disadvantages.  Amongst the problems with this approach are: (1) See Lucas (1 976) and Goodhart (1 97 5). A model to analyse financial fragility — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 107  1. There is an inevitable lack of focus on dynamic, secondary interactions between agents in such exercises.  Since the attention is on the single institution, there is no practical possibility of modelling contagion between institutions, or between differing sectors of the economy.  This means, in effect, that contagion cannot be effectively studied in the set-up, which concentrates on the individual institution or on the aggregate of banks. 2. Even if individual banks are asked how each would react to some particular stressed condition (a stress test) it is impossible to work through second and third-round effects consistently and, in practice, it is also impossible to prevent banks from adopting inconsistent auxiliary assumptions. More recent empirical models try to take some of this critique into account by modelling the financial system on a more disaggregated basis.  Bunn et al (2005) develop a model for the United Kingdom, which enables one to analyse how shocks to the current macroeconomic environment might feed through to the UK banking system.  Bunn et al point out that these models are very useful from a surveillance perspective as they provide a coherent framework to discuss the possible magnitude of risks facing the financial system.  However, these models still lack a coherent framework to analyse contagion between banks or feedbacks from stress in the banking system back to the macroeconomy. Other models have been constructed to investigate financial fragility and, in particular, the role of financial intermediation in transmitting and amplifying shocks.  At the empirical level, most work has been trying to model interactions between banks with the aim of overcoming the deficiencies of looking at banks on an individual basis.  This line of research has explored the direct links between banks in the interbank market, and the potential spillover between banks following the initial failure of a member of this market.  Examples of such work include Wells (2002), which analyses the impact of a sudden and unexpected insolvency of a single bank on the capital position of a number of other banks, and Elsinger et al (2002), which analyses the consequences of macroeconomic shocks for the insolvency risk of a portfolio of banks by combining standard risk management techniques with a network model of stylised interbank exposures. On the more theoretical front, numerous macroeconomic models analyse the impact and propagation of macroeconomic shocks in the presence of financial market imperfections.   Haldane et al (2004) provide an excellent review of most of this work.  Our framework shares many features with these models — it includes financial intermediaries, it is characterised by incomplete markets, and finally it has financial contracts that cannot be perfectly enforced.  As we have mentioned, our model has two important additional features: both banks and private agents can default and they are heterogeneous.  These two ingredients allow us to assess the vulnerability of the banking sector to adverse shocks and to analyse the transmission of shocks, which initially affect individual agents, to the rest of the financial and economic system. The model Our model is based on the work by Tsomocos  (2003a, b).(1) In summary, it incorporates heterogeneous banks and capital requirements in a general equilibrium model with incomplete markets, money and default.  It extends over two periods(2) and all uncertainty is resolved in the second period. Trade takes place in both periods in the goods and equity markets.  In the first period, agents also borrow from, or deposit money with banks, mainly to achieve a preferred time path for consumption.  Banks also trade amongst themselves, to smooth out their individual portfolio positions.  The central bank intervenes in the interbank market to change the money supply and thereby determines the official interest rate.(3) Capital adequacy requirements (CARs) on banks are set by a regulator, who may, or may not, also be the central bank.  Penalties on violations of CARs, and on the default of any borrower, are in force in both periods.  In order to achieve formal completeness for the model, banks are liquidated at the end of the second period and their profits and assets distributed to shareholders.  Box 1 makes the time line of the model explicit. In the first period, trades by all agents take place against a background of uncertainty about the 108 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — A model to analyse financial fragility (1) For a more detailed description of the model see Goodhart et al (2006). (2) Any finite horizon extension follows mutatis mutandis. (3) The official rate and the rate in the interbank market are the same, since our focus is on financial fragility.  economic conditions (the state of nature) that will prevail in the second period.  Agents are, however, assumed to have rational expectations, and to know the likelihood (the probability distribution) of good or bad states occurring when they make their choices in period one.  In period two the actual economic conjuncture (the state of nature) is revealed and all uncertainty is resolved. The model incorporates a number of distinct, ie heterogeneous, commercial banks, each characterised by a unique risk/return preference and different initial capital.  Since each bank is, and is perceived as being, different, it follows that there is not a single market for either bank loans or bank deposits.  In addition, we introduce limited access to consumer credit markets, with each household assigned (by history and custom) to borrow from a predetermined bank.  This feature allows for different interest rates across the commercial banking sector.(1) In sum, multiple credit and deposit markets lead to different loan rates amongst various banks and to endogenous credit spreads between loan and deposit rates. Individual non-bank agents are also assumed to differ in their risk attitudes and hence in their preferences for default.  We model the incentive for avoiding default by penalising agents and banks proportionately to the size of default.  Banks that violate their capital adequacy constraint are also penalised in proportion to the shortfall of capital.(2) Both banks and households are allowed to default on their financial obligations, but not on commodity deliveries. In the model, financial fragility is taken to include any private sector defaults and reduced bank profitability and, therefore, it is not limited to episodes of bank runs, panics and other extreme disruptions of the financial system.

(2) This way of dealing with default was first introduced by Shubik and Wilson (1 977).  For further discussion of approaches to modelling default, see Tsomocos and Zicchino (2004).  for bank equity also allows us to investigate how a fall in bank equity values would affect financial fragility. Our definition of financial fragility is connected to welfare losses, liquidity shortages and the banking sector’s vulnerability to default.  Amongst other consequences, financial fragility, so defined, may impair the efficient allocation of savings to financial investments and thus the ability of households to smooth consumption. Results In this model, both regulatory and monetary policies are non-neutral.  This arises essentially from having incomplete financial markets and liquidity constraints.  Monetary and regulatory policies influence the distribution of income and wealth amongst heterogeneous agents and hence have real effects.  Some other main results are: G the central bank controls the overall liquidity of the economy and such liquidity, as well as endogenous default risks, determines interest rates; G nominal changes (ie changes in monetary aggregates) affect both prices and quantities;  and G the nominal interest rate is equal to the real interest rate plus the expected rate of inflation (Fisher effect). From an analysis of a set of comparative statics exercises, using the model, a number of implications arise.  First, in an economic environment in which capital constraints are binding, more expansionary monetary policy may lead banks in some cases to adopt riskier strategies.(1) The liquidity injected by the central bank can be used by some banks to expand their loans to the non-bank private sector.  This can lead to a rise in the size of their assets, relative to their capital base, thus worsening their capital position.  It is a well-known stylised fact that financial crises are often caused by excessive, and unwise, lending in the upswing of the cycle,(2) which then leads to non-performing loans and failures in a subsequent downturn, should an adverse shock occur.  Thus expansionary policies causing ‘excessive’ loan expansion can lead to financial fragility. Second, agents who have more investment opportunities can deal with negative shocks more effectively by restructuring their investment portfolios expeditiously.  Such restructuring may put even more pressure on other agents with a more restricted set of investment opportunities.  For example, banks which can move into security investments when there is an adverse shock to customer borrowing may make market conditions even worse for banks which cannot so diversify.  This result has various implications. Amongst them, banks with asset portfolios that are not well diversified tend to follow a countercyclical credit extension policy in the face of a tightening of regulatory standards in the loan market (eg tighter loan risk weights) during an economic downturn.  In contrast, banks that can quickly restructure their portfolio tend to reallocate their investments away from the loan market, thus following a procyclical credit extension policy. Third, an improvement such as a positive productivity shock, which is concentrated in one part of the economy, does not necessarily improve the overall welfare and profitability of the economy. The last two insights relate to the innovative feature of the model of incorporating heterogeneous agents; banks and bank borrowers are not all alike.  This has some, fairly obvious, implications.  The result of a shock depends on the particular sector of the economy which is affected and it can often shift the distribution of income, and welfare, between agents in a complex way, which is hard to predict in advance. Simulation:  a negative bank capital shock to bank x in the initial period In what follows we describe in more detail one of the simulations we conducted.  There are, however, numerous other simulations and calibrations which can be run with such a model.  Several examples are in Goodhart et al (2004a, 2004b and 2005).  We simulated a 25% negative shock to the capital of a single bank — bank x, which is a net lender in the interbank market(3) — in the initial 110 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — A model to analyse financial fragility (1) This does not imply, in our model, that a deflationary bias is optimal.  The model does not include inflation targeting.  Such a regime could be approximated by maintaining the money supply fixed. (2) See, for example, Borio and Lowe (2002). (3) Since all the numbers in the table represent changes with respect to the initial values of the variables, similar movements in levels may result in noticeably different percentage changes.  This is the case, for example, for the profits of banks y and z, since bank z has much higher initial profits than bank y.  period.(1) This, extremely unlikely, event could be envisaged as the result of a huge fraud.  Table A shows the percentage changes in the values of some key variables. We assume first that the central bank uses the monetary base as its monetary policy instrument and fixes the supply of bank reserves by injecting, or withdrawing, funds in the interbank market.  There is, of course, a dual relationship between the  policy-determined short-term interest rate and the quantity of bank reserves, though this relationship can be affected by the institutional details of the precise way in which the central bank operates in the money markets.  In practice, central banks always set interest rates rather than the reserve base  (Bindseil (2004)).  One reason that they do so is that setting interest rates (rather than reserve quantities) strongly dampens the effects of certain shocks on the banking system.  This happens, for example, in the case of a monetary policy shock, as the contagion channel operating through the interbank linkages is weakened by the central bank fixing the interbank rate.  But by the same token, taking the reserve base as fixed in our simulations provides clearer and stronger responses to shocks, which is useful for illustrative purposes. A decrease in the capital endowment of bank x causes a contraction in the funds available for loans to other banks and for loans to households.  Other things being equal, the interest rate in the interbank market and on bank x’s loans to households increase, by 3.5% and 4% respectively (ie from 4% to 4.2% in the first case and from 6.9% to 7 .1% in the second).  The interest rate on bank x’s deposits also increases as bank x tries to make up for its shortfall in capital by an increase in deposits.  The end result of bank x’s portfolio reallocation is a decrease in both interbank loans and loans to households. Unlike bank x, banks y and z are net borrowers in the interbank market.  They respond to the higher cost of interbank borrowing by decreasing their demand for interbank loans and by raising more funds through deposits.  This causes the deposit and lending rates of banks y and z to rise, as shown in the second and third column of Table A, and thus loans to decrease. The decrease in bank lending is the result of both the first-round and second-round effects of the initial shock to capital.  All banks have less available funds: bank x because of the fall in its own capital, the other banks because they can borrow less in the interbank market.(2) Also, bank x wishes to extend fewer loans, to avoid its capital to asset ratio decreasing dramatically.  The second-round effect comes through the impact of a decrease in lending on future GDP . Banks anticipate that lower credit availability will cause a fall in output — as period-two GDP is a A model to analyse financial fragility — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 111 Table A Percentage change in key variables given a negative 25% shock to bank x’s capital at t = 1 Bank x Bank y Bank z rb d 4.1 3.5 3.5 rb 4.0 4.7 4.6 ρ 3.5 πb i 0.046 0.04 0.007 πb ii 0.06 0.05 0.008 kb i -2 1.9 0.6 0.6 kb ii -25.1 0.7 0.6 νb i -0.1 5 0.009 0.005 νb ii -0.3 -0.001 -0.01 6 GDPi -0.24 GDPii -0.24 Legend: rb d = deposit rate offered by bank kb ∈B = {x, y, z};(a) rb = lending rate offered by bank kb ∈B; ρ  = interbank rate; πb i = profits of bank kb in state of the world i;(b) πb ii = profits of bank kb in state of the world ii; kb i = ratio of capital to risk – weighted assets of bank kb in state i; kb ii = ratio of capital to risk – weighted assets of bank kb in state ii; νb i = repayment rate of bank kb to all its creditors in state i;  and νb ii = repayment rate of bank kb to all its creditors in state ii. (a) For the sake of illustration, the characterisation of banks x and y is based on two big UK banks, which we cannot identify for confidentiality reasons, while bank z is constructed by consolidating data of five other big UK banks.  Needless to say, the rest of the model is highly stylised, so these results should not be taken to indicate what would happen if a big UK bank lost capital. (b) State i refers to a good/normal state of the world in period two, which occurs with probability 0.95.  State ii reflects a bad state of the world with probability 0.05. (1) The values of banks’ balance sheet items in the initial period are calibrated using the 2002 annual account data for the seven largest UK banks.  The values of private agents’ loan repayment rates are obtained from the same source of data.  All macroeconomic variables are calibrated from UK data in the same year, 2002.  The value of GDP in the bad state is set to represent a 4% fall from its value in the good state.  Values for all other variables in the bad state are set in a similar fashion.  The parameters of the reduced-form equations describing the loan demand, the deposit supply, households’ repayment rates and the relationship between the GDP and bank credit are partly based on estimated relationships for the UK economy and partly chosen arbitrarily.  See Goodhart, Sunirand and Tsomocos (2005) for more details. (2) Banks are not able to offset the shortfall in funds due to the bank x’s capital shock completely by raising more deposits, because these become increasingly costly (the supply of deposits is an increasing function of the deposit rate).  positive function of the aggregate credit supply in the initial period — and a decline in the repayment rates of households.  Thus, the expected rate of return on loans decreases causing a further reduction in banks’ credit supply. This mechanism is like the financial accelerator of models à la Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist (1 999), where an initial shock to GDP is amplified by the effect that this shock has on the value of the borrowers’ collateral and, therefore, on the cost of outside finance for firms (the so-called ‘external finance premium’)(1) and ultimately induces an additional decrease in investment and in output.  In our model, the amplification mechanism works differently.  A shock to a bank’s capital endowment reduces the total availability of loanable funds and, since future GDP is a positive function of credit supply, it also decreases future households’ income. This in turn causes a decrease in the repayment rates of households (or, in other words, an increase in default rates), who borrow money from banks.  Banks then want to reduce their supply of loans even further. In effect, the working of the ‘external finance premium’ in BGG is akin to a ‘default premium’ in our model. The effect of an exogenous shock to bank x’s capital on the other key variables presented in Table A can be understood by noting that in our model banks maximise their payoff by equating the marginal benefit from profits with the marginal cost from default and capital violation penalties.  Penalties are imposed by the regulator on banks that violate the capital constraint and which default in the deposit market — as well as in the interbank market if they are net borrowers (as it is the case for banks y and z). Hence, in trying to achieve maximal payoff, banks face a trade-off.  On the one hand, higher profits increase banks’ utility both directly and by raising banks’ capital to asset ratios.  On the other hand, to obtain higher profits, other things equal, banks need to take more risk, ie to increase their expected default rates (equivalent to a decrease in their expected repayment rates).  But lower repayment rates translate into higher costs in the form of higher expected default penalties.  Following a negative shock to bank x’s capital, the default probabilities of households also increase and, as a consequence, the values of banks’ risk-weighted assets decrease.  In this simulation exercise, banks’ profits do not change much, as the increase in lending rates is offset by the higher cost of funds.(2) Bank x’s capital and capital to asset ratio both decrease considerably in the second period while the capital holding and the capital to asset ratios of banks y and z are almost unaffected. To summarise, in this simulation a shock to bank x’s capital affects all other banks because of their interaction in the interbank market.  Specifically, in response to a negative shock to its capital, bank x is willing to supply less liquidity to the rest of the banking sector.  This causes all interest rates to increase and aggregate credit supply to decrease. While most of models used to analyse financial stability cannot cope, by construction, with contagious effects, the explicit modelling of  links among heterogeneous banks in our framework allows us to investigate the extent of contagion to the rest of the banking system of shocks to individual institutions.  This key property comes, however, at the cost of additional complexity.(3) 112 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — A model to analyse financial fragility (1) In models with asymmetric information in the credit market, collateral is used by lenders as a screening or incentive device.  By pledging collateral, and therefore by mitigating the potential for adverse selection or moral hazard, borrowers can reduce the cost of obtaining external funds.  Therefore, when the value of collateral decreases, as may happen when the economy is affected by an adverse shock, borrowing becomes more expensive. (2) Bank x also benefits from a higher rate on its interbank investments.  However, it has to pay a higher rate to its depositors, who anticipate that, in order to reconstitute the capital base, the bank will try to maintain its profitability by taking more risk. (3) The version of the model used for the simulation exercises contains 56 simultaneous equations in 1 35 unknown variables. Step 1: Identify the relevant question; Step 2: Simplify the general model (ie reduce the number of markets, banks, investor sectors, assets, and time periods to the minimum required for step 1); Step 3: Calibrate the initial equilibrium of the simplified version of the model using data; and Step 4: Perform scenario analysis under different exogenous shocks (eg regulatory and monetary policy, capital, preferences, etc). Box 2:  Model implementation  A model to analyse financial fragility — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 113 Model implementation As in any large-scale macroeconomic model, multiple channels of interaction exist and economic sectors interact with each other so as to achieve an equilibrium.  However, our framework is flexible enough that when a policy-related question is identified, its size and complexity can be reduced appropriately.  Hence, streamlined versions of the model can be generated and subsequently calibrated against real data to address policy issues rigorously. In Box 2 we suggest a simple procedure for the implementation of the model. Conclusions In reality, the economic system is both complex and heterogeneous.  In order to model it in a way that is mathematically tractable, rigorous and yet simple enough to be illuminating, economists have often tended to assume homogeneity amongst agents in the sectors involved.  Unfortunately that prevents analysis of certain key features of financial fragility, especially those relating to interbank interactions. The model here presented focuses on such interactive channels.  That inevitably raises the complexity of modelling;  however complexity has been limited by adopting the simplifications of an exchange economy with only endowed consumers and banks(1) (ie assuming no firms, no external sector, no other financial intermediaries, a black-box official sector). In our model, banks and households (investors) are both heterogeneous and active.  Second, there is a complete endogenous feedback mechanism, both amongst banks, amongst investors, between banks and investors, and between the real and nominal sectors of the economy.  Liquidity plays a major role, and default is endogenous within the system;  so we can seek to study the effect of regime changes on default probabilities.  This model should, at least in principle, be able to provide a flexible tool for studying both shocks and policy changes.  It is computable and can be calibrated against real data. Nevertheless there are some disadvantages.  First, there are no disaggregated data, identifying the customers of the individual banks.(2) Second, the model lacks an explicit modelling of some agency problems between borrowers and lenders, and also between bank equity holders and managers, as is suggested in the literature on the theory of banking.(3) Third, we do not incorporate production into the exercise at all. We would like to see this work as the start of a major programme to use models such as this for the analysis of financial fragility.  We have constructed the theoretical model;  performed simulations based on a simplified version of the general model to assess the qualitative impact of shocks;  calibrated an even simpler version of the model against UK data to examine the simulated response of the UK banking sector as a whole to a variety of assumed shocks; finally, we have extended the model to cover a longer horizon than the two periods employed in the general model and calibrated the model again with UK data to evaluate its performance against a time series of macro and banking data. Our next objective is to provide some empirical metric for the definition of financial fragility as proposed in the model.  This will involve sticking to two main principles;  first, that heterogeneity is essential;  second, that, for the present, we believe that our approach to modelling default and liquidity is the best available modelling strategy.  Otherwise we hope to examine a wide range of alternative structures. The main challenges ahead will be, first to represent a complex reality in a manner that is both illuminating and yet reflects that reality, and second to be able to draw general conclusions from a variety of related models that, whilst keeping to the basic principles outlined above, nevertheless have differing particular specifications, depending on the simplifications used, and reflecting the issues under consideration. (1) In the more general set-up of the model based on an exchange economy GDP is given by the aggregate endowment. (2) So in this respect the version of the model used for the simulation exercises cannot be based on proper optimising households’ decisions. (3) Examples of models based on the assumption of asymmetric information between borrowers and lenders are the ‘credit rationing’ models (like the one by Stiglitz and Weiss (1 981)).  The idea of potential conflicts of interest between owners and managers has been vastly applied in the banking literature.

A model to analyse financial fragility — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 115  116 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — Stress testing as a tool for assessing systemic risks STRESS TESTING exercises are an important tool in gauging the robustness of the financial system to large — but still plausible — shocks.  In its broadest sense, a stress test is a ‘what if’ exercise:  considering what might happen to the financial system, or to individual firms, were certain risks to crystallise.  The use of well articulated models in this ‘what if’ analysis is important, as they provide a coherent and consistent framework for assessing which risks might pose the greatest threat to balance sheets or to financial stability, and so merit the closest attention. Market and, to a lesser extent, credit risk stress tests are increasingly being used by financial institutions.(2) The results can be used to inform high-level discussion of the appropriate appetite for different types of risks and the amount of capital that should be set aside to cover them.  Moreover, stress testing may also reveal hidden correlations across portfolios.  For example, at first glance, corporate and household arrears might seem unrelated.  They may, however, both be affected by the same macroeconomic shocks and so move together.  Credit risk stress testing will become a requirement under the second pillar of the new Basel capital accord and the United Kingdom’s Financial Services Authority (FSA) is working with firms to promote good practice in stress testing.(3) Stress tests can also help policymakers in gauging the potential implications of different risks for the financial system as a whole, and hence in identifying those which may pose the greatest threat to systemic stability.  In recent years, there has been a burgeoning interest in such systemic (or financial stability) stress testing amongst central banks and international organisations.(4) In contrast to stress tests undertaken by individual banks, financial stability stress testing at the Bank of England has, to date, focused on the system-wide implications of macroeconomic shocks.  Idiosyncratic risk factors, such as the failure of a single large firm, are rarely considered.  And, while market disruptions have the potential to threaten the stability of the financial system, quantitative assessment of such systemic impact is also rare, reflecting the complexity of the modelling challenge. Systemic stress testing now features routinely as an element of the International Monetary Fund’s Financial Sector Assessment Programmes (FSAPs).  In 2002, for example, the UK authorities and IMF staff developed and carried out a stress testing exercise as part of the United Kingdom’s FSAP .(5) Overall, that exercise suggested that the stability of the UK banking system was unlikely to be threatened by any of the adverse scenarios considered. Stress testing exercises are widely used by financial institutions in assessing their exposures to credit and other risks.  Stress tests can also help policymakers to gauge the potential implications of differing risks for the stability of the financial system as a whole.  And in recent years, there has been a burgeoning interest in such systemic stress testing among central banks and international organisations.  This article describes the systemic stress testing framework currently used by Bank staff.

Stress testing as a tool for assessing systemic risks Philip Bunn, Macroprudential Risks Division, Alastair Cunningham and Mathias Drehmann, Financial Industry and Regulation Division, Bank of England(1)  But it also emphasised the importance of further development work, to gauge better the resilience of the financial system to potential shocks. A key element of the FSAP exercise was a ‘bottom-up’ stress test.  In this exercise, the UK authorities constructed four specific macroeconomic scenarios which were supplied to six large UK-owned banks and four foreign investment banks.  The banks were asked for their assessments of the impact of the four scenarios on their portfolios.  This type of approach has the benefit of enabling responding banks to apply the scenarios to internal data about the structure of their credit portfolios, but it has a number of disadvantages. First, bottom-up exercises may be costly for participating institutions, as participants will need to run additional stress tests — over and above those used in their own risk assessments — if they are to capture the implications of the specific scenarios being considered.  These potential costs preclude the frequent running of ‘bottom-up’ exercises which is important if stress tests are to assess risks as they evolve.  Second, it is difficult to gauge how far differences between banks’ results reflect the methods and assumptions used rather than differences in their underlying portfolios. Third, and most importantly, the ‘bottom-up’ approach is not flexible enough to test the implications of differing judgements about the way in which households, companies and banks react to the shocks. And, indeed, the Financial stability conjuncture and outlook articles in previous Reviews have highlighted many areas in which borrower and lender behaviour might have changed relative to past experience, so that historical models do not necessarily represent a ‘best guess’ of the way in which the economy might now evolve in times of stress.  Any meaningful use of stress testing models should, therefore, involve exploration of the implications of differing judgements, rather than being a ‘black box’ exercise. To overcome these limitations, subsequent research has tried to enhance the Bank of England’s ‘in-house’ modelling of the full chain from economic shock to banks’ balance sheets.  So far, the focus has been on stresses which are macroeconomic in origin and, even where these economic stresses are considered, the Bank’s systemic stress testing research has concentrated on domestic credit risks rather than foreign credit, market, liquidity or operational risks.  This reflects, to some degree, data availability.  For example, a full stress test of market risks requires detailed data on positions and contracts that are neither publicly disclosed nor subject to regulatory reporting.  Moreover, surveys reveal that individual banks themselves are not yet able to integrate stress testing of market, credit and liquidity risks systematically. Given these limitations, the Bank’s current stress testing framework is still work in progress but, even with further development, no single model is ever likely to capture fully the diverse channels through which shocks may affect the financial system.  Stress testing models will, therefore, remain a complement to, rather than a substitute for, broader macroprudential analysis of potential threats to financial stability. This article describes the current systemic stress testing framework used by Bank staff as part of the toolkit for financial stability assessment.  Before describing the Bank’s approach to stress testing, the article outlines some general features of stress testing exercises and the challenges in running them.  The final section illustrates the approach by presenting an update of the stresses analysed in the United Kingdom’s FSAP . Features of stress testing models The essence of stress testing is to develop a view of the way in which a shock — crystallisation of a risk — might impact on banks’ balance sheets.  Chart 1 decomposes stress tests into six steps which form a ‘chain’ from the original scenario to banks’ profit and loss accounts.  These steps are not only the essence of financial stability stress tests but generic to any market or credit risk stress test. Choice of shock The first element of a stress test is the selection of the initial shock, or indeed combination of shocks.  Each shock comprises a change in some specific risk factor such as productivity or oil prices.  One key issue is how large a shock to consider.  Because systemic stress tests aim to highlight vulnerabilities to stresses, the shock should be extreme.  But, for any policy conclusions to be meaningful, it should not be so extreme as to be implausible.  So, for example, there is no real value in considering the impact of simultaneous default by all borrowers! Typically, shocks are calibrated using one of four methods.  One is ‘historical’, in which the shock is Stress testing as a tool for assessing systemic risks — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 117  118 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — Stress testing as a tool for assessing systemic risks calibrated to match a specific past event such as the early-1 990s’ recession.  Another is ‘probabilistic’ in which the shock is calibrated against the distribution of all past outturns;  for example taking the 99th percentile of past oil price changes.  Stress scenarios may also be ‘hypothetical’, assessing the impact of risks for which past experience does not provide a ready yardstick.  Another alternative sometimes used in systemic stress testing is to ‘reverse engineer’ shocks:  assessing how large a shock would need to be to generate losses in excess of some threshold. Mapping from shocks to systemic impact The stress testing chain starts by considering the impact of the initial shock on the future evolution of the macroeconomic environment (step two in Chart 1).  This step is important as it enforces an explicit modelling of correlations of the macroeconomic determinants of credit risk — such as unemployment and property prices — between each other and across time. The changing macroeconomic environment will affect borrowers’ balance sheets, and hence the incidence of default (step three).  So, for example, an adverse supply shock might lead, at least in the short term, to an increase in interest rates.  This in turn would lead to rising income gearing, making it harder for some households to service their debts.  The incidence of arrears might therefore rise. In a fourth step, changes in arrears are mapped to losses on loan portfolios.  The mapping from default to losses is not one-for-one, because lenders may recover a part of the value of defaulted loans — for example, through possession of properties held as security against mortgage debts.  The actual loss rate depends on the value of collateral held, which may in turn have been affected by the impact of the shock on the macroeconomic environment.  The macroeconomic environment may also affect banks’ earnings — for example any slowdown in borrowing will reduce potential interest income (step five). Taken together, these steps enable a consistent mapping from the scenario to the impact on banks’ balance sheets (step six). The diagram and the discussion so far have been presented as a chain but, of course, there may be feedback at all stages.  So, for example, were banks to incur material losses, they might cut back lending, with consequences for household and corporate balance sheets, and ultimately for macroeconomic variables.  Were the banking sector to be so heavily affected that one institution failed, other banks might experience further losses — arising, for example, from counterparty exposures or from any falls in asset prices following the liquidation of the ailing bank’s portfolio. Many of the shocks analysed here do not appear to have a significant effect on the banking sector’s profits.  We might not, therefore, expect any feedback to prove material — but where stress testing does identify material impacts, feedbacks may be (much) more important and warrant further analysis. Modelling feedback and the interaction between banks, households and companies is complex: because of the many channels through which such feedback may operate;  because of the critical role of expectations and information;  and because past experience may not be a good indicator of behaviour in extreme circumstances.  An article elsewhere in this Review describes one model that can help form an assessment of possible feedbacks.(1) (1) Initial shock Eg equity price fall (2) Impact on macroeconomic  environment Eg GDP , unemployment, etc (3) Impact on the incidence of  default by borrowers Via household and corporate  balance sheets (6) Lenders’ profit and loss accounts (4) Mapping to lenders’ loss rates Via impact on collateral value  and exposures (5) Lenders’ earnings Chart 1 Stylised representation of a systemic stress test (1) Goodhart, C and Zicchino, L, ‘A model to analyse financial fragility’ in this Review.  Estimation challenges Although there are many ways to calibrate the various stages of the chain, they have two important and related challenges in common: G Very adverse macroeconomic conditions combined with high credit losses are rare.  Moreover many of the time-series data used in financial stability analysis have been available for only a short time.  This makes it hard to form an accurate estimate of the statistical relationships in all steps of the chain. Moreover, the estimation challenge is compounded by the changes in the landscape of financial service provision over the recent past — with, for example, wide-ranging developments in the management of credit risks and a growth in the array of financial market products used by banks. These changes may affect borrowers’ and lenders’ responses to macroeconomic stresses, so that historical experience may not be a good guide to future behaviour. G Most statistical models are linear.  This approximation may well be reasonable when shocks are small.  But when shocks are extreme, non-linearities may be important:  doubling the size of the shock may more than double its impact.  And, indeed, many credit risk models suggest a non-linear relationship between the scale of shocks to firms’ balance sheets and the likelihood that they subsequently become insolvent.  It is also quite possible that economic relationships will change in times of stress.  So, for example, when there are few mortgage possessions, banks may be able to realise collateral without affecting house prices.  But when rates of possession are high, banks may need to accept offers well below prevailing market prices, if they are to realise collateral promptly. Given these technical challenges, no single model can hope to generate robust answers.  Instead, there is a role for judgement at each step of the chain — for example, considering the potential implications were the relationship between credit card arrears and income gearing to be stronger than the average of past history.  The technical challenges in modelling financial stresses mean that there is bound to be considerable uncertainty around the precise numbers derived from any stress test. Notwithstanding this uncertainty, however, a key benefit of stress tests is that they impose a coherent structure in which to discuss risks and the potential impact of structural changes on the stability of a financial system.  It is by ensuring the consistency of the scenario that stress testing exercises can add rigour to systemic analysis. Stress testing at the Bank of England Bank of England staff have developed several models to facilitate systemic stress testing exercises.  These models are used to calibrate the six steps of the chain described in Chart 1. G Step 1.  Shock selection.  The example below is based on a ‘probabilistic’ scenario selection, as deployed in production of the stress tests used in the United Kingdom’s FSAP.  Hypothetical scenarios have been used to explore the robustness of the UK financial system to some of the risks identified in recent Reviews. G Step 2.  The impact of scenarios on the macroeconomic environment is calibrated using one of the Bank of England’s macro-forecasting models, typically using recent Inflation Report forecasts as a ‘base case’ on which to build.  In the stylised example described in the next section, the economic implications of the shocks follow mechanically from the model, with judgements applied only in assessing implications further along the chain.(1) One key factor driving the impact of the shocks is the assumed policy reaction.  For the purpose of this stylised exercise, monetary policy is assumed to follow a Taylor rule.(2) G Step 3.  The profiles for macroeconomic variables are run through separate models of corporate and household sector balance sheets.  The Bank’s suite of satellite models for household and corporate balance sheets was first described in an article in the December 2001 Review. Since then, the various models have been refined, (1) This treatment is, of course, not representative of the ways in which the Monetary Policy Committee considers the economic implications of the risks surrounding their central assessments.  As has been described elsewhere, Committee members use a range of models and judgements in forming their assessments. (2) Under a Taylor rule, interest rates are modelled as a linear combination of deviations of inflation from a target rate and output from potential output. Stress testing as a tool for assessing systemic risks — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 119  as described in a series of Working Papers.(1) The key equations are summarised in Annex 1. In the statistical models used, income gearing — a measure of the ease with which households and firms can cover debt servicing obligations — is found to be an important driver of corporate liquidations, mortgage arrears and credit card arrears.  GDP and unemployment have an additional impact and corporate liquidations and mortgage arrears are also found to be affected by the prices of commercial and residential property respectively. The models used have two important limitations. First, they are estimated at an aggregate level, rather than by considering the experience of individual households or firms.  One cost of this approach is that it cannot pick up the implications of any change in the composition of the borrower population. Individual banks themselves may be better able to differentiate within sectors, using the data on individuals and companies collected in deciding whether or not to approve each loan.  Second, there is little explicit feedback from household arrears and corporate liquidations to the macroeconomic profiles.  The Bank’s macroeconometric models do, however, implicitly embody past feedbacks, as such feedbacks will be reflected in the historical macroeconomic data used to estimate them. G Step 4.  Banking sector losses on corporate portfolios and unsecured loans to households are modelled in aggregate.(2) As discussed above, sectoral defaults need not map in a one-to-one fashion into bank losses.  For corporate exposures, write-offs are driven by the interaction of commercial property values (a proxy for collateral) and liquidation rates.  Indeed, even under scenarios in which property values fall sharply, the collateral offers some protection.  Collateral values do not affect the mapping from arrears on unsecured household loans to write-offs. Mortgage write-offs are modelled in a different way, in order to exploit the limited disaggregated information available on the distribution of collateral values across banks’ portfolios.  Information on the loan-to-value ratios (LTV) of new loans and the flow of mortgage redemption payments is used to construct a rough estimate of the distribution of collateral values across all loans.  In the example below, we assume that loans with the highest LTVs default first, but the model also permits an assessment of the implications for write-offs under different assumptions about the distribution of LTVs for those in arrears. G Step 5.  Changes in banks’ income are modelled in a reduced-form fashion.  Given changes in the structure of the banking sector over recent years, it is, perhaps, not surprising that statistical relationships are weak.  There is a correlation between the banking sector’s interest income and GDP growth.  But no statistically significant link between economic activity and other types of income has been found. G Step 6.  The overall impact on the banking sector’s profits is driven by changing write-offs and income streams.  This follows mechanically from the sector’s exposures to the three broad asset classes and the importance of interest income as a source of earnings. Systemic stress testing:  an example This section sets out an example of the use of stress testing models for systemic analysis.  It repeats and extends the analysis undertaken in the United Kingdom’s FSAP , to highlight the flexible method that has since been developed. Selection of shock The FSAP exercise used four scenarios, recapped in Box 1.  The shocks used in this example have not been updated to reflect any changes to the economic conjuncture since the FSAP exercise. In the original FSAP exercise, the impact of each shock was estimated over a twelve-month period, with monetary policy assumed to react according to a Taylor rule.  One consistent theme of feedback on the results of the exercise was that the stress tests might have generated a greater impact had the shocks been run over a longer horizon.  In re-running the exercise, 120 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — Stress testing as a tool for assessing systemic risks (1) The original set of satellite models was described in Benito, A, Whitley, J and Young, G (2001) ‘Analysing corporate and household sector balance sheets’, Bank of England Financial Stability Review, December.  Further developments are described in:  Whitley, J and Windram, R (2003), ‘A quantitative framework for commercial property and its relationship to the analysis of the financial stability of the corporate sector’, Bank of England Working Paper no. 207;  Bunn, P and Young, G (2004), ‘Corporate capital structure in the UK:  determinants and adjustment’, Bank of England Working Paper no. 226;  Whitley, J, Cox, P and Windram, R, (2004), ‘An empirical model of household arrears’, Bank of England Working Paper no. 21 4. (2) Earlier versions of the write-off equations are described in Hoggarth, G, Logan, A and Zicchino, L (2005), ‘Macro stress tests of UK banks’,  in Investigating the relationship between the financial and real economy, BIS Paper no. 22.  we have therefore extended the horizon to three years — and indeed, the maximum impact on the banking sector typically occurs during the third year.  The scenarios are run from 2005 Q1. One benefit of ‘in-house’ modelling is the flexibility to experiment with differing shocks.  So, for example, we can consider what might happen were the four shocks to coincide and explore whether their effects would reinforce or offset one another.  In preparing this example, we considered all possible combinations of the four shocks described in Box 1.  Combining shocks in this way begs the question:  is it plausible that several extreme events might coincide? In calibrating a set of coincident shocks, one might in principle consider the historical covariance between shock factors (for example, assessing how far equity and exchange rate shocks have coincided in the past). But we have not done so in preparation of this example, so the results should be viewed as the output of a purely mechanical exercise. Mapping shocks through the chain The macroeconomic implications of the shocks are assumed to evolve in line with the marginal properties of one of the Bank’s macro-forecasting models.  In all cases, changes in the macroeconomic environment are small relative to the recession of the early-1 990s. So, for example, GDP continues growing, albeit more slowly than in the base case, under most of the scenarios considered.  The relatively small macroeconomic impact reflects, in part, the assumed monetary policy response to the shocks that follows from use of a Taylor rule. Under most of the shock scenarios, inflation rises and the Taylor rule therefore generates a tightening of monetary policy.  This leads to a rise in debt servicing costs.  Indeed, household and corporate debt servicing costs are currently more sensitive to movements in interest rates than previously, because indebtedness is higher relative to income than it has been in the past. Past empirical work at the Bank has confirmed that income gearing is a key driver of liquidation rates and arrears.  Hence, when all shocks coincide, mortgage arrears rise to around 31 / 2%, or close to their historical peak, and corporate liquidations also increase as the economy slows.  It is striking that Stress testing as a tool for assessing systemic risks — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 121 The four scenarios used were: A Decline of 35% in world and UK equity prices.  Under this scenario, lower equity prices are assumed to result from a downward revision in expected corporate earnings.  The macroeconomic transmission is largely through household balance sheets, with lower personal sector wealth reducing household consumption and hence aggregate GDP . The impact on demand and output is, however, partly offset by the consequent easing in monetary policy that follows from the Taylor rule. B Decline of 1 2% in UK residential and commercial property prices.  This scenario is assumed to result from a general drop in demand for the flow of property services.  Since housing accounts for one half of UK households’ net worth, the personal sector’s balance sheet deteriorates and UK household consumption is reduced.  Output is lower than otherwise but the adverse effect is a little smaller than under the first scenario. C 1.5 percentage point unanticipated increase in UK average earnings growth (reflecting a step increase in real reservation wages).  This supply shock boosts personal incomes and consumption but the transmission to higher inflationary pressure induces a rise in official interest rates under the Taylor rule. Overall there is a marginal decline in GDP compared with the base case. D A 1 5%(initial) unanticipated depreciation in the trade-weighted sterling exchange rate.  This scenario entails a fall in the demand for sterling owing to an increase in the perceived relative riskiness of sterling assets (in other words, a rise in the sterling risk premium).  Sterling depreciation results in higher inflation and, in response, nominal interest rates increase under the Taylor rule.  Nonetheless, since wages and prices adjust only gradually, there is a temporary depreciation in the real exchange rate which in turn boosts net export volumes. Box 1:  Scenarios explored during the 2002 FSAP exercise  122 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — Stress testing as a tool for assessing systemic risks both corporate liquidations and household arrears rise, at least temporarily, under almost all of the stress tests. The last stage of the stress testing exercise is to gauge the implications of these rising default rates for the large UK-owned banking sector’s profits.  The slowdown in economic activity associated with the stresses leads to a small reduction (relative to base) in banks’ interest income.  But the largest impact on balance sheets is through default by household and corporate borrowers. Aggregate lending to UK households and non-financial companies accounts for around a third of the major UK banks’ assets.(1) The remainder comprises foreign claims and exposures to UK financial institutions.  The aggregate numbers do, however, mask some wide-ranging differences between the major UK banks (Chart 2). The bulk of domestic claims on non-financial institutions are residential mortgage exposures. However, while mortgage arrears rise under the stress tests, the collateral held by banks cushions the impact on balance sheets.  Banks’ accounting disclosures suggest that average loan-to-value ratios across their residential mortgage portfolios are typically below 50%.  It is, therefore, not surprising that loss rates on mortgage portfolios remain small — even when all shocks coincide (Chart 3). Write-offs on unsecured lending to households almost double to around 5% in the third year of the stress test;  but these loans account for less than 5% of the sector’s assets. Lending to companies — around a quarter of the sector’s domestic claims on non-financial institutions — is also often collateralised, so liquidations do not map one-for-one to loss rates. The extent to which this collateral covers risks is affected by the profile of commercial property prices under the stress scenarios.  Corporate loss rates are around 1% in the third year when all shocks coincide — more than three times the loss rate on mortgage portfolios. Chart 3 underlines the importance of running stress tests over a longer horizon.  It takes time for the shock to work through to a rise in arrears and liquidations, so that write-off rates are little changed in the first year of the stress test, but then increase markedly. The text above has focused on the ‘worst case’ combination of shocks, to give an impression of the way in which a shock works its way down the chain from the initial change in an exogenous factor to banking sector balance sheets.  Chart 4 summarises the results of all the various shock combinations. The equity price fall is the most benign scenario.  Some of the other individual shocks have a much greater impact — the largest being the exchange rate shock. The ranking of the individual shocks differs from that in the FSAP exercise, in which the equity price shock had the greatest effect.  This reflects, in part, the (1) The peer group used is described in Box 1 on page 1 8 in this Review. 0 20 40 60 80 100 Domestic claims Residential mortgages Credit cards Other loans to households PNFCs Residual:  claims on financial  institutions Interquartile range Median Percentage of total assets Chart 2 The major UK banks’ domestic claims as at end-2004 Source:  Bank of England and FSA regulatory returns. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 2004 Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Mortgage Unsecured household Corporate Percentage of loans written off   Chart 3 Write-offs on domestic portfolios under the ‘worst case’ combination of shocks Source:  Bank of England.  exclusive focus on domestic credit risk in the example presented here, whereas banks’ participating in the FSAP could have considered the impact of the shocks across all activities.  But it also reflects the longer horizon used in the stress tests, as the macroeconomic effects of some shocks unwind more quickly than others. When several shocks coincide, the impact is typically greater than for any of the shocks taken in isolation. Indeed, interactions between the shocks often magnify their impact so that the overall effect on banks’ profits is more than the sum of the individual shocks.  So, for example, a shock to property prices reduces the value of collateral available and hence increases the impact of a rise in arrears, from any source, on banks’ profits. Nevertheless, even the worst case considered costs the banking sector just 0.35% of total assets. That said, however, some individual banks within the system might be affected more than others and, as mentioned above, a failure of an individual bank might have systemic implications.  As a rough check, we gauged the overall impact on individual banks by applying changes in write-off rates mechanically to each institution’s balance sheet exposures.  No bank loses more than 0.6% of assets under any combination of these four shocks. The stress tests shown take estimated models at each stage of the chain as a ‘best guess’.  There are risks around these central cases, which on the downside would imply that the sanguine results understate the threat to financial stability were these scenarios to occur.  There are also risks that the model might not fit the data well.  The models do, however, provide a framework for exploring which of the myriad uncertainties might have the greatest impact on our conclusions.  Such discussion — or ‘what if’ analysis — may be helpful in focusing future assessment work and indeed in gauging the degree of uncertainty surrounding the results. Extreme responses under stress As argued above, theoretical models suggest that the relationship between default and balance sheet shocks is likely to be particularly pronounced during episodes of stress.  And, while the estimation period of both the macroeconomic model and the satellite models determining arrears and liquidations rates do cover the experience of the recession in the early-1990s, the dataset is dominated by the sustained and stable growth through the remainder of the 1990s.  It is, therefore, possible that any model based on normal linear statistical techniques will be unrepresentative of stress periods.  Indeed, in the case of the corporate liquidations equation, the fit is relatively poor during the recession period. One way of assessing the potential implications of these non-linearities is to ask:  what if the experience of the early-1 990s is representative?  In other words, re-running the shock analysis with the corporate liquidations equation adjusted to fit the experience in the 1 990s’ recession rather than the average over the entire decade.  Under the ‘worst case’ combination of shocks, this ‘what if’ exercise sees corporate liquidations rising considerably further (Chart 5).

Stress testing as a tool for assessing systemic risks — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 123  124 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — Stress testing as a tool for assessing systemic risks As discussed above, another reason why large shocks may have a disproportionate impact is the potential for banks’ responses to affect asset prices if all banks want to realise large amounts of housing collateral. One way of assessing the potential implications of any asset firesale is to ask:  what if banks incurred (say) a 10%, or even a 20%, haircut on any mortgage collateral realised during the stress test?  Under the full combination of shocks, cumulative mortgage losses would be 40% higher with a 10% haircut and 7 5% higher with a 20% haircut. Structural breaks As argued above, the financial landscape has changed over the past 1 5 years, so that borrowers’ and lenders’ responses to shocks may differ from historical experience.  In a modelling sense, these changes mean that some estimated parameters no longer represent a ‘best guess’ of the true response of borrowers and lenders to shocks.  Further research, analysis and market intelligence might enable us to understand better the behavioural implications of any structural changes identified in the Review.  But there are many candidate changes, so how can the work best be focused?  Stress testing models provide one tool for prioritisation, by providing a rigorous framework within which to ask how far the impact of shocks might be increased (or indeed decreased) were equation parameters to differ from historical estimates. As an example, consider the implications of the recent rapid growth of the buy-to-let mortgage market, as discussed in previous Reviews.  Bank contacts have differing views on the vulnerability of these exposures.  On the one hand, buy-to-let borrowers may be better able to finance their mortgages than are first-time buyers.  On the other hand, buy-to-let borrowers may be less inclined to tolerate negative equity than are owner occupiers — so their arrears may be more sensitive to movements in house prices.  Because the market is new, the behaviour of buy-to-let borrowers through a business cycle is untested. ‘What if’ analysis can help in gauging how much of a risk this new market might pose for financial stability. For example, we have re-run the ‘worst case combination’ assuming that buy-to-let borrowers are twice, three times and even four times as sensitive to house price movements as average households.  There is no science to this calibration, though quadrupling the sensitivity seems extreme.  But even under this extreme assumption, the major UK banks would lose no more than a further 0.01% of assets over the three years — a low number, reflecting the small scale of buy-to-let lending.  While some banks may be more affected than the sectoral average, it seems quite likely that other candidate structural breaks will have more material implications for the stability of the financial system. Concluding comments This article has outlined how stress testing exercises can be used to assess the potential impact on the financial system of the risks identified through surveillance analysis and market intelligence.  In doing so, it draws out some features of stress testing analysis that are pertinent for stress testing by individual banks as well as by financial authorities concerned primarily with systemic risk.  The estimation challenges faced in modelling financial stresses are sufficiently significant that no single model can hope to generate robust analysis in isolation.  Meaningful stress testing exercises will, therefore, involve discussion and judgement.  The value of the models is in providing a coherent framework within which to consider the implications of differing judgements. The Bank’s suite of models has been broadened in recent years, permitting ‘in house’ stress testing of the entire chain from economic shock through to banking sector balance sheets but many limitations remain.  In particular, the focus on domestic lending omits any potential for the shocks considered to generate losses on either foreign credit exposures or through any impact on the functioning of financial markets.  The integration of market and international risks is an area in which we hope to develop the framework in the future.

Inter-industry linkages between UK life insurers and UK banks:  an event study — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 127 ASSESSING THE IMPORTANCE of interlinkages between financial sectors is a key ingredient in financial stability analysis, given the Bank’s responsibility for the stability of the financial system as a whole.  Matthew Corder’s article in the December 2004 Review provided a comprehensive qualitative assessment of the potential risks to financial stability arising from non-bank UK-resident financial sectors.  It concluded that, even when disruption to a non-bank financial sector does not pose a direct threat to the financial system, such disruption could still have financial stability consequences through its effects on the banking sector, whose systemic importance is clear.  The article described three potential channels of contagion through which stresses from one financial sector could be transmitted to the rest of the financial system:  counterparty exposures;  links through capital markets;  and effects on confidence. Although banks’ monetary returns and accounting disclosures are sufficiently detailed to obtain a first estimate of counterparty exposures, they are less useful in measuring the two remaining channels: links through capital markets and confidence.  Market prices, however, provide a natural way of gauging the materiality of linkages between sectors via all three transmission channels.  This article thus adopts a quantitative approach based on market prices. Among the various non-bank UK financial sectors, previous Reviews have concentrated on UK-resident life insurers, as falls in global equity prices from 2001 to early 2003 reduced solvency margins across the sector.  Furthermore, the emergence of the bancassurance model over the past decade has led to an increasing involvement of UK banks in the life insurance market.  The potential for contagion from the insurance sector to the UK banking sector has therefore become a more important issue.  This article focuses on periods of stress in the UK life insurance sector during 2001–03, and analyses movements in equity prices to corroborate the information contained in balance sheet data. Measuring interlinkages using balance sheet data The direct credit exposure of UK banks to the UK life insurance sector is limited.  Loans to UK-resident insurers and pension funds account for just 6.3% of the major UK banks’ Tier 1 capital.  But ownership interests are potentially more significant.  At the end of 2003, six of the ten largest UK-owned banks owned life insurance subsidiaries, although their scale varied markedly.  In adverse circumstances, life subsidiaries might affect their parents via:  reductions in banks’ operating incomes;  the effect on banks’ capital from changes in subsidiaries’ ‘embedded value’;  and the cost of re-capitalising a life insurance subsidiary.  Life insurers are also heavily involved in capital markets and provide important financial services to households and corporates.  Market prices have the ability to reflect this additional relevant information and, therefore, provide a convenient way of gauging the significance of spillovers via capital market and confidence channels, Interlinkages between financial sectors are an important consideration in the assessment of the overall financial system.  Whilst previous Reviews have focused primarily on the banking system, an article in the December 2004 Review provided a comprehensive qualitative assessment of the risks to financial stability arising from other UK-resident financial sectors.  This article builds on that work by exploring the degree of co-movement in market prices as an indicator of linkages between sectors.  The event study approach used in this article measures the extent of any spillover to UK banks’ equity prices from specific events affecting the UK life insurance sector.  Inter-industry linkages between UK life insurers and UK banks: an event study Allan Monks and Marco Stringa, Financial Industry and Regulation Division, Bank of England  as well as through the counterparty exposures measured by accounting data.(1) Measuring interlinkages using correlations Correlations between equity prices are often used as a simple metric to assess the potential for contagion between sectors.  In Chart 1, the bilateral correlation between the UK banking and life insurance sectors is compared to those of the banking sector with all other sectors of the UK equity market.(2) Over the period 1 986–2004, the median correlation between the equity prices of UK banks and those of the non-financial UK sectors fell slightly (blue line). However, over the same period, the correlation between UK banks and the UK life insurance sector increased (pink line).  The rise in correlation might partly be attributed to the increased involvement of banks such as Abbey, HBOS and Lloyds TSB, in the life insurance market in the second half of the 1 990s and early 2000s. The main shortcoming of correlation analysis is that the equity returns of any two sectors may arise as a result of market-wide developments, which do not reflect any interlinkages or spillovers from one sector to another.  Equity returns can be affected by developments on three levels:  the overall market, a specific sector, or an individual institution.  While the last two are relevant for identifying specific interlinkages between two sectors, the first is not. Hence, systematic market-wide movements must be filtered out first when assessing the degree of spillover from the life insurance to the banking sector. Moreover, as Chart 1 shows, correlations vary over time, so that average relationships might not accurately reflect the potential for contagion in times of stress. An event study approach In order to uncover spillovers between the two sectors, an event study technique can be used to remove the systematic part of equity returns.  The intuition behind the event study technique lies in the separation of equity returns into two components: the first due to general market movements and the second due to the impact of a chosen event, thereby revealing the specific systemic impact of life insurance events.  Such an approach also enables the ex-post measurement of interlinkages during stress periods, resolving the problem of correlations varying over time. The remainder of this article explains the event study approach in more detail and then presents a set of results and concluding comments. Event selection In any event study the choice of events is paramount. First, the events need to meet some general criteria: G The event should be unexpected, as equity prices should not react to expected events if markets are efficient. G The event should not coincide with the release of other significant but unrelated news, due to the difficulties of disentangling the impacts of the two events. Second, for the purpose of this article, some additional criteria are required: G The event should have occurred in a relatively recent period.  Structural changes in either the economy or banks’ business models could result in misleading conclusions if earlier events are used. G The event should have originated from the life insurance sector. 128 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — Inter-industry linkages between UK life insurers and UK banks:  an event study 0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1986 88 90 92 94 96 98 2000 02 04 Full range:  Banking and other sectors excluding life insurance Median:  Banking and other sectors excluding life insurance(b) Correlation:  Banking and life insurance sectors(b) – + Chart 1 Correlation between UK banks and other UK sectors’ equity prices(a) Source:  Thomson Financial Datastream.

(1) Furthermore, while accounting data could take several months to be published, market indicators can be obtained quickly. (2) According to Datastream’s classification, the UK equity market can be divided into eight representative sectors:  resources, basic industries, general industrials, non-cyclical consumer goods, cyclical services, non-cyclical services, utilities, and financials.  The life insurance and banking sectors are used in place of the financial sector.  Furthermore, spillovers through the financial system might operate asymmetrically depending on whether news is good or bad.  So, in this article, only negative events are considered. During the 2001–03 period, UK life insurers were adversely affected by a prolonged fall in global equity prices.  As equity prices fell, speculation grew about the regulatory solvency of some UK life insurers.  At the beginning of 2003, the FSA revised its policy, waiving some regulatory rules governing the calculation of solvency, provided the life insurers both remained strong on ‘realistic’ solvency measures and continued to meet EU minimum requirements.  The 2001–03 period thus provides a suitable window to assess the degree of interlinkages between UK life insurers and UK banks as revealed by market price movements. A list of candidate events was made after examining daily news events during the chosen period.  Both idiosyncratic events — news originating from a single life insurance firm — and sector-wide events — news originating from more than one life insurance firm, or from an external source with relevance to the life sector — were considered.  From the list of candidates, six events were judged to have met the selection criteria (Table 1). Event study method The event study approach employed in this article uses a market model to estimate the relationship between an institution’s equity returns and overall stock market returns (see Annex).  Daily equity returns can then be decomposed into two parts for the statistical model adopted:  general market movements forecast by the model, and the remaining residual — the abnormal return (AR).  The AR is then divided by its standard deviation to obtain the standardised abnormal return (SAR).  If the calculated SAR on the event day is significantly different from zero, the firm’s equity price is deemed to have been significantly affected by the event. The ten largest UK-owned banks, which accounted for more than 90% of UK-owned banks’ assets over the period studied, are used to represent the UK banking sector.  The five UK-owned life insurers in the FTSE 100 Index at the time of the study were used as a proxy for the life insurance sector. Event study results The results are presented in three steps:  first, institutions are analysed individually, then they are grouped into a life insurance index and a bank index, and finally the bank index is split into three sub-indices according to the proportion of life Inter-industry linkages between UK life insurers and UK banks:  an event study — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 129 Source:  Bloomberg.

In each case, Chi-square (χ2) and SCAR statistics are used to provide a summary of the six events (see Annex). Both summary statistics are necessary complements for a correct interpretation of the results.  The SCAR — by summing returns over the events to capture the average reaction — may cause two oppositely signed but significant reactions to cancel each other out.(1) The Chi-square statistic avoids this problem by summing squared returns, but has the disadvantage of not distinguishing between positive and negative responses.  The Chi-square also differs from the SCAR, by testing whether at least one of the events is significant, rather than the average response across events.  The results for individual institutions are shown in Table 2. The first column lists all the institutions in the sample.  Columns two to seven report the SARs for each event.  The last two columns show the Chi-square and SCAR summary statistics.  Red shaded cells indicate a significant reaction to an event at the 99% confidence level, with orange shaded cells indicating significance at the 95% level. Both summary statistics show that each of the five life insurance companies experienced a significant negative reaction to the six events as a whole.  This confirms that the selected events had a significant impact on the life insurance sector, a pre-requisite for assessing spillover effects to the banking sector. Observing the events individually, idiosyncratic events only have a significant impact on the life insurer that the news originated from.  Thus there appears to be no spillover effects to the rest of the life insurance sector from firm specific idiosyncratic events.  For sector-wide events, perhaps unsurprisingly, significant reactions appear for several insurers. The banking sector had a more mixed reaction. Lloyds TSB shows the strongest response to the events, as evidenced by its Chi-square and negative SCAR.  Although HSBC has a marginally significant Chi-square, its SCAR is not significant, implying a moderate and varied response to the events. According to the Chi-square statistic, none of the remaining banks have been affected significantly.  The SCAR statistic reinforces this point, with the exception of Abbey National.  Abbey has a negative (a) SARs are reported for the day of the event. (b) Reaction calculated net of the dilution effect of the right issue described in Table 1.

Focusing on individual events (SARs in Table 2), those defined as idiosyncratic showed no spillover to the banking sector.  The sector-wide events did, however, prompt significant reactions from some banks.  In a few cases — including the significant effects at HSBC — SARs are positive.  This adds further uncertainty when trying to identify the impact of events on the banking sector by using individual institutions’ results. In order to asses the overall impact on the banking sector, individual institutions are aggregated into two portfolios representing the banking sector and the life insurance sector (Table 3).  The summary statistics are broken down to capture sector-wide (S–W) and idiosyncratic (Idio) events separately. For the banking sector, both summary statistics show that when the sector is viewed as a whole, there is no significant reaction to either the sector-wide or idiosyncratic events.  As an initial conclusion, these results suggest that there is no clear evidence of spillover from the life insurance sector to the banking sector as a whole.  However, Table 2 reveals that some individual banks did have significant responses to the events. In order to investigate the above findings further, a third step is taken which aggregates banks according to the proportion of life insurance assets they held. This classification is best characterised as follows: ‘bancassurers’, which held the highest proportion of life assets;  ‘mortgage banks’ with the lowest proportion;  and ‘internationally active banks’ which fell in between these two extremes (Table 4). The bancassurers group reacted significantly to sector-wide events according to both summary statistics (Table 5).  There is thus evidence of a reaction from bancassurers’ equity prices to life insurance events, which lends support to the notion that there is a potential channel for spillovers to the banking sector via ownership.  There is no significant evidence that either the international or the mortgage banks’ equity prices reacted to the events. Concluding comments This article employs a quantitative approach to assess the significance of spillovers from the UK life insurance sector to the UK banking system in times of stress.  During the 2001–03 period of global equity market decline, several life insurers were exposed to adverse conditions.  This provides a period of materially important events for the life insurance sector, which are used in the event study to reveal interlinkages between institutions using equity prices. The event study method has the benefit of being able to detect spillovers arising from the full range of interlinkages.  The same cannot, however, be said about balance sheet data, which tend to reveal only counterparty exposures.  The event study provides a powerful tool that can be applied to any event, and used to extract the corresponding systemic part of an equity price reaction, helping uncover evidence of interlinkages.

The results of this relatively small sample show that, when the events are considered collectively, each insurer experienced a significant reaction.  Of these events, neither of the idiosyncratic disturbances spilled over to the UK banking sector as a whole. However, there is evidence that elements within the banking sector responded to the sector-wide events, but these reactions are not uniformly pervasive.  On closer inspection of the banking sector, the results show that the bancassurers were the only group where equity prices were affected by disruptions in the UK life insurance sector.  These results might suggest that spillover to the banking sector came through ownership, while the links through capital markets and effects on confidence were not materially significant during the events considered.  Inter-industry linkages between UK life insurers and UK banks:  an event study — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 133 Annex A market model is used to remove the impact of market wide movements on equity returns: [1] Ri;t and Rm;t are the period-t returns for institution i and the market portfolio respectively, and ui;t is the disturbance term.  The FTSE All-Share index is used as a proxy for the market return. The parameters of the market model are estimated by using a 250-trading day (one year) window, Ti, beginning 270 days before the event.  Abnormal returns (ARs) are defined as the difference between the actual return and the predicted return: [2] [3] where t = 0 is the event day.  The presence of autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity in the market model means that the estimates are inefficient.  Therefore, the Newey-West HAC adjustment is used to calculate σ 2 ARi;0 .    The variance of the ARs is then used to form a standardised abnormal return (SAR): [4] where Ti is the number of days in the estimation window, and t(.) denotes the student t distribution.  By Using equation [4] with the appropriate critical values, the significance of the ARs can be estimated.  A summary measure of ARs across events can be obtained as follows: [5] where E is the number of events.  The SCAR statistic, by capturing the average reaction, may cause two oppositely signed but otherwise significant reactions to cancel each other out.  A Chi-square statistic is an alternative summary statistic that avoids this issue: [6] ( ) ; SARi e e E E τ χ = = ∑ 0 2 1 2 ∼ SCAR SAR E t T i i e e E i τ τ = = = = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ∑ 0 0 1 2 ; ( – ) ∼ SAR AR t T i t i t AR i i t ; ; ; ( – ) = σ ∼ 2 VaR VaR cov i i i i ( ˆ ), ( ˆ ) ( ˆ ; ˆ ) α β α β  and  AR R R E V i t i t i i m t i ; ; ; ; – ˆ – ˆ ( ) = = α β where  AR and  0 0 ar AR VaR R Var i AR i m i i ( ): ( ˆ ) ( ˆ ) ; ; ; 0 2 0 2 0 2 σ α β = + + R VaR u m i i i ; ; cov ( ˆ ; ˆ ) ( ) 0 0 α β + R R u E u Var u i t i i m t i t i t i ; ; ; ; ; ( ) , ( = + + = α β where   0 t ui t ) ; = σ 2  However, the Chi-square, by squaring the ARs, does not distinguish between positive and negative responses. Finally, an F-statistic is used to assess whether there is a significant difference in the impact of sector-wide and idiosyncratic events: [7] where S is the number of sector-wide events, and Y the number of idiosyncratic events.

Traditional concerns remain that unwise credit exposure can result in insolvency, and systemic instability.  But today there is a new series of hazards. Credit risk transfer has introduced new holders of credit risk, such as hedge funds and insurance companies, at a time when market depth is untested. Systemically significant issues could increasingly arise from market-related risks, or from single point of failure risks in the market infrastructure as ever greater volumes of transactions pass through.  Equally the growth of derivative instruments and advent of a range of new asset classes, despite added dispersion and better risk management, have added to the risk of instability arising through leverage, volatility and opacity.  No wonder that those involved in financial stability work have much to think about. Introducing a framework for financial stability The purpose of my remarks today is not to analyse these threats.  Instead I want to discuss how to approach some of the challenging issues faced by many central banks as we seek to decide how best to organise our work and to allocate resources in order to promote financial stability. Given that, we need to be clear, accountable and transparent as to how we devote our resources in this area.  And just as the financial system becomes more complex, so the judgements as to what we do and what we do not do are increasingly difficult.  That is why we need a framework — a set of organising principles — that enables us to provide context and understanding to our endeavours, to provide a source of focus and rigour to our approach, and to motivate our people. The issues are, I believe, of general application. Though you will forgive me I am sure if I start by looking at the framework within which the Bank of England, as a non-regulatory central bank with a remit for system-wide stability, addresses the vulnerabilities. Challenges in creating a framework Monetary policy I want to start by considering the governance of the Bank’s accompanying mandate, the conduct of monetary policy.  This highlights the clarity of our accountability in the monetary policy arena.  In line with many central banks, we have a mandate in statute — the Bank of England Act — to conduct monetary policy.  The Government sets a target inflation level which we are required to meet. Importantly we — and you — can see how we are performing month by month in relation to our mandate.  We also have a tested analytical framework. We model possible future outcomes and we look at the balance of risks around a central view.  We can rely on experience and judgement to make regular policy decisions.  And we can alter our policy decision on interest rates each month as the data and circumstances evolve. Financial stability and why it is different If financial instability occurs, costs to society may be high.  Damage to our reputation could be potentially high too.  Yet judging the optimal amount of resources to devote to prevent crises is problematic. This is the text of a speech delivered by Sir Andrew Large, the Bank of England’s Deputy Governor for Financial Stability, at the International Conference on Financial System Stability and Implications of Basel II on 18May 2005 in Istanbul. A framework for financial stability Sir Andrew Large, Deputy Governor, Bank of England (1) The author is grateful to his colleagues Alastair Clark, Nigel Jenkinson, Andy Haldane and Victoria Cleland for their help in preparing this speech.  What degree of resilience do we want?  And what should we be prepared to pay for insurance?  This is a familiar problem in public policy — what is the optimal size of the fire brigade or army? The challenges we face in seeking to maintain financial stability are very different to those in the monetary policy arena. G First, there is neither a clear over-arching analytical framework nor a commonly agreed set of indicators of incipient financial instabilities. G Second, the task is made harder because we are dealing with tail events — low probability scenarios — rather than central projections.  It is about aberrant rather than normal behaviour and situations:  less predictable and harder to model. G Third, there are a number of different potential policy instruments that can affect the financial environment in various, sometimes conflicting, ways.  And by no means are all in the hands of central banks. G Fourth, national financial stability responsibilities are often shared.  In the United Kingdom we work with Her Majesty’s Treasury (HMT) and the Financial Services Authority (FSA).  For cross-border activities we operate alongside overseas central banks and supervisors. G Fifth, although the roles of the United Kingdom authorities are outlined and published in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), this gives little guidance as to what financial stability is or a clearly identifiable target. G And, last, it is harder to get motivational feedback — unless in unwelcome form should a crisis occur. Defining our role in financial stability oversight These factors pose a number of challenges in defining our role in financial stability oversight — what activities should we as a central bank undertake?  To make these decisions, firstly we should identify the main functions that need to be performed in each jurisdiction to promote financial stability.  Then we can look at the Bank’s own institutional mandate. And finally we can determine the most appropriate way to fulfil it. Three essential functions for public authorities There seem to me to be three essential functions to be carried out in securing financial stability:  I think this is the case in most jurisdictions.  First, there are the roles relating to supervision of firms and markets where financial instability could arise. Second, there is the oversight of the financial system as a whole — the systemic issues which could impinge on society.  And, third, there is the fiscal underpinning which may exceptionally be required to restore confidence in the event of failure. The fiscal underpinning is a role for Ministries of Finance.  The other roles can either be combined institutionally or separated.  I am sure each model is represented here today.  In the United Kingdom, HMT has responsibility for the fiscal underpinning, FSA for the supervision of firms and market regulation, and the Bank of England for the stability of the system as a whole. The ‘must dos’ for the Bank of England The roles as such are set out with slightly more precision in the MoU, and it is from there that we start on our quest to decide what initiatives we — the Bank of England — should undertake, and how far we go with each.  The MoU highlights three ‘mustdos’ for the Bank.  I expect that these are similar in many central banks.  They really define our mandate. (a)  Assessment of threats to financial stability First, we need to assess the threats to the financial system.  We need to be in a position to inform ourselves and to advise HMT at all times on the implications for UK financial stability of developments in both the domestic and international market places.  We do this by continually assessing threats to the system as a whole — ‘oversight of the systemic conjuncture’ if you like. So we look beyond the risks in relation to individual institutions, to the aggregate problems that can arise: through networks and single points of failure; through dependencies and interdependencies of firms and markets.  In other words to areas where, if market forces and market participants are left to their own devices, problems could threaten the stability of the system.  This means that we need to have our finger on the pulse and to maintain regular contact with key firms and infrastructure providers.  Market intelligence is vital in this area:  it is not enough to 136 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — A framework for financial stability  read about issues, we need to be learning about them first hand from key players and analysing our findings from a financial stability perspective. The FSA also shares responsibilities in this area.  They too will be asked for advice by HMT.  Their starting point is the assessment of the strengths and weaknesses in the individual institutions and markets they supervise, and the potential consequences of problems or failures at individual institutions. An important factor for the Bank relates to London’s position as a major financial centre.  Although our specific focus and interest is the systemic conjuncture as it affects the United Kingdom, possibilities of contagion in an increasingly global market mean that we have to be alert equally to developments in global capital and financial markets. And it means we have to understand the dynamics and interrelationships of markets;  how new products work;  and the possible behaviour patterns of intermediaries, investors, and borrowers.  Above all we need to be focused on where major risks are most likely to emerge and the market dynamics if those risks start to crystallise.  And we need to distinguish those which are systemic from a myriad of fascinating developments, many of which are just ‘noise’ but which could otherwise distract us. (b)  Risk reduction:  oversight of payment systems The second area where we, and typically other central banks, are required to perform is oversight of payment systems.  Payment systems facilitate economic transactions of goods, services and financial assets and are an essential component of a well functioning financial system.  So reduction of risks in these systems, for example through the introduction of our Real Time Gross Settlement system, is clearly a priority from a systemic perspective. (c)  Provision of liquidity and preparation for a financial crisis And, third, the MoU stipulates that we need to be in a position to inject liquidity at all times.  This means that we must be able to provide liquidity in normal times, as well as in times of stress or crisis.  This puts an increased onus on well developed and tested crisis management plans, and a particular focus on ensuring that we are able to undertake a range of official financial operations in exceptional circumstances. Financial stability:  parallel processes Recognition of these three ‘mustdo’ areas is a starting point in deciding the scope of our financial stability work and in enabling us to fulfil our MoU mandate.  But it does not provide a clear steer on what we actually have to do to carry out our functions efficiently and effectively.  Regarding long-term thinking, which might one day lead to an analogue to monetary policy, we are undertaking a research project.  This is separate from our day-to-day activities where a set of organising principles can be used operationally to handle today’s issues. Research and Development (R&D):  creation of an analytical framework The research project is an attempt to devise an analytical framework as an analogue to that in monetary policy:  to help clarify some of the differences I outlined earlier and to provide greater certainty and focus.  As with the development of monetary frameworks, this will be a medium to long-term endeavour.  This may sound overambitious. But even modest achievements towards it would enhance understanding of what financial stability oversight is about, and what our priorities should be in seeking to ensure it.  And so it could assist our quest for clearer accountability and more transparent governance arrangements. This quest gets to issues such as how to define our financial stability objective, how to articulate indicators of financial stability, and how they relate to each other.  It provides the possibility of calibrating systemic risk and developing tools that could potentially be deployed to reduce such risk, and will include scenario analysis and macro-stress testing. In reality, it is unlikely we will converge on a single model which captures systemic risk in its entirety. But by developing and calibrating a suite of models we hope to make some progress towards gauging fragilities and frictions in the financial system better — how likely they are to arise;  on what they depend; and, ultimately, what pre-emptive mitigating action might be feasible.  This could put financial stability analysis on a more similar analytical footing to monetary policy — albeit with a greater amount of uncertainty regarding eventual outcomes. With time we can review the outputs of this research work.  We can then operationalise those that are relevant and robust to help decide our ongoing A framework for financial stability — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 137  activities.  In other words, the outputs of this R&D activity could become inputs to prioritising our day-to-day risk reduction activities. Ongoing activities:  organising principles In the meantime we have to address the real risks of today.  How are priorities to be set?  Financial stability is an area where there are so many things we could do.  So we need to have a set of organising principles to help us prioritise and focus.  I’d like to describe the process we go through in addressing the difficult decisions — how much to do, and how far to go. One could make a case for a huge empire of threat assessment on the basis that seemingly remote events or threats could crystallise into a financial crisis.  For example, what resources would it have taken to foresee that default of the Russian government on its debt in1 998 would, through a complex chain of events, eventually result in the failure of the hedge-fund Long Term Capital Management in NewYork?  A failure which importantly was judged as having wider significance for financial stability. Equally what resources could it be wise to devote to assess what implications, if any, the downgrades of General Motor’s and Ford’s debt this month might mean for the financial sector and ultimately for financial stability. Alternatively one might take a hardline view that unless an activity falls fairly and squarely, in the short run, into one of the ‘must do’ categories, it should be discontinued.  For example, we could in theory simply ignore risk emanating from overseas — even in an international financial centre like the United Kingdom — on the expectation (or hope) that others would take care of these risks on our behalf. Common sense suggests that the answer lies somewhere between the two.  But difficult judgements are involved.  So we have to devise a rigorous process to scrutinise our actions.  A valuable approach is to set out the practical actions we intend to achieve — the ‘outcomes’ or ‘deliverables’ — and then to challenge them.  We do this from two points of view. First, we need to be clear why we are pursuing a particular deliverable.  Is it a market failure justifying any intervention at all?  What real impact will the work have on fulfilling our mandate?  How closely does it relate to the ‘must dos’? Second, we need to think through the costs, benefits and risks associated with the action from the points of view of both likelihood and impact.  What will be the risks to society, the economy and even the Bank if we do not do it?  How might these risks be reduced if we do do it?  How well placed are we to do it as opposed to others?  How confident are we of achieving the intended deliverables — particularly when we need to rely on others?  Do we have influence to ensure action is taken? The answers — difficult as they may be to define — help us in prioritising and resource allocation;  and provide sunset provisioning in deciding whether to continue with particular strands of work. Ongoing activities:  the matrix Uses for the matrix There are many types of activity, and many sources of threat where we could be active.  So we need organising principles to make sense of where particular actions fit into the landscape of our financial stability work.  It is only then that we can evaluate competing priorities, by subjecting each ‘bid’ to a common set of challenges.  To do this we find it helps to use a simple matrix.  This adds objectivity to what is in many senses a subjective process.  Here is an example: The matrix is a common sense map, which enables us to visualise why something is being done, and where it fits into the overall financial stability effort.  The specific activities and deliverables that are located in each of the boxes can be scrutinised to see if they meet our objectives or if they should be discontinued. 138 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — A framework for financial stability Matrix:  organising principles for financial stability Sources of threat Activities Credit risk Market and liquidity Infrastructure (including payment systems) International architecture Assessment of threats to financial stability Risk  reduction Preparing for and managing a financial crisis  This helps us decide on the level of resource and the nature and qualities of people we need.  It also helps with budgeting, and provides a basis for motivating good performance. To explain the relevance of the boxes let us look first at the columns:  sources of threat.  Our desired end objective is to promote financial stability by seeking to prevent threats from crystallising, or at least to reduce their impact.  Then we will look at the rows — the different types of activity we undertake:  the means if you will to achieve our ends. Sources of threat First, the columns:  the sources of threat. (a)  Credit risk Financial crises have traditionally arisen where the solvency of one or more institutions either crumbles, or is perceived to be in danger of doing so, in a way that threatens the financial system.  So we need to focus on credit concentrations, credit aspects of prudential standards, credit pricing and terms etc. We need data and intelligence to do that. Understanding credit conditions and vulnerabilities is quite well developed territory.  But new threats have arisen, particularly from sophisticated credit transfer instruments.  This is a tricky and opaque arena.  It is hard to know where concentrations of credit risk actually reside and even where credit risk ends and market risk begins.  In addition there is the increasing range of participants who are also taking on credit risk.  Of course in addition to this we can — and do — think about credit risk standards like BaselII.  We focus on the systemic aspects of prudential design since in the UK the supervisory issues are focused on by the FSA. (b)  Market and liquidity risk As the global capital market has expanded on the back of securitisation and derivatives increasing vulnerabilities arise.  Change has been so rapid and development so fast that it has been hard for any of us to keep up.  Given the multitude of new instruments and new markets that have appeared and the resulting increase in risk, this is a significant area of work for us. There is of course much to be done in understanding the complex interdependencies and concentrations, and how these might impact on financial stability. So we need data and market intelligence in this area. And we need to improve our ability to make ex ante judgements about the possible behaviour of both investors and intermediaries, as well as the potential depth of markets.  Equally we need to be sure we would have relevant information and understanding of markets and agents should problems arise. (c)  Infrastructure (including payment systems) Focus is also important in the field of payment, clearing and settlement systems.  Historically payment systems were primarily domestic entities, but as markets have become more globalised so too has the underlying infrastructure.  This has helped to enhance efficiency, but leads also to added network or ‘single point of failure’ risks.  As 9/1 1 showed, when problems arise in this area liquidity injection may be needed to prevent market or institutional failure, and risks of instability to the financial system could mount swiftly. This brings us to one of our ‘mustdos’ — oversight of payment systems.  Based on adequate data and understanding we work here on enhancing interoperability, strengthening risk management, strengthening business continuity resilience, and improving governance. (d)  International architecture International architecture and emerging markets exposures are a broad arena where there are particular risks and complexities which lead us to look at it separately.  In response to the wider environment, constant adaptation is needed both of the architecture itself and the institutions within it, such as the IMF.  In terms of our quest for financial stability, this focuses specifically on sovereign debt, crisis prevention and resolution.  Progress has been made since the Asian Crisis, but significantly more is needed to build on the emerging elements of the exceptional access framework, and the Fund’s lending-into-arrears policy, but also Collective Action Clauses, and the recently devised Principles for Stable Capital Flows and Fair Debt Restructuring in Emerging Markets. In using the matrix to categorise sources of threat there are of course a number of ways one could cut the cake.  Credit exposure to emerging sovereign debtors for example can appear both in the ‘credit’ and ‘international architecture’ boxes. A framework for financial stability — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 139  Activities Now we can move to the rows.  To use the matrix as a location device to focus our efforts, decide on deliverables and enhance our resource allocation, we need to create the ‘boxes’ by considering the types of activity we could undertake to address each main source of threat — the rows. (a)  Assessment of threats First, we need to evaluate threats to the system.  We need a process of data collection and assessment to analyse information and market intelligence from multiple sources.  This ‘horizon scanning’ enables us to get early warning of how and where threats could appear. We cannot do all this without knowing how markets work.  Typically we obtain intelligence about what is going on from a number of sources, including a group of experienced staff who are operationally active in financial markets.  We then evaluate and assess the threats from this intelligence.  This needs people who are motivated to think through and identify new aspects of risk and threats, who can move with intellectual agility and flexibility between risks as they arise.  This enables us in turn to judge the risk and allocate resources accordingly for risk reduction — as well as stopping work if threats no longer seem relevant. A key challenge here is distinguishing between slow burn issues (such as a gradual shift towards more exotic financial instruments) and the more immediate issues relating to, say, the prospect of a major market default.  In each case it is important to understand the potential threats to financial stability:  but the timescales and tools are different.  The matrix helps to start the process. Above all we have to clarify the types of threats we are looking for.  An issue here is the risk of ‘missing something’.  Not acting on something seemingly minor may have significant consequences for financial stability and costs compared to the resource saved by ignoring it.  So the stakes are high in getting this right — though we need here to be realistic as particularly in the early stages the significance of developments can be hard to read. (b)  Risk reduction Second, risk reduction or mitigation.  Here we seek to make the financial system more resilient.  This is the world of risk management, prudential standards, liquidity standards, resilience of payment systems etc. It can involve the promotion of codes and standards over a wide field ranging from accounting to improving legal certainty, and management of countries’ external balance sheets. Decision making about priorities is particularly challenging because we cannot be clear ex ante how well the mitigation techniques will work, and we often need to rely on others to implement them.  In addition we need to ask whether we are the right party to act. We also need to think about the relevance of our activities to our mandate — or ‘must dos’.  In some areas, for example payment systems — one of our ‘must dos’ — it is clear that we have a responsibility to reduce risks.  In this case the questions we need to answer relate to the degree, methods and resource implications. But in other areas whether we should act is less clear cut.  What particular contributions can we make and are there any areas where we can sensibly act alone? We need to ascertain areas where we can achieve results both domestically with HMT and FSA, and internationally with organisations such as the Basel Committee, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and the Financial Stability Forum. Perhaps I can mention one area to which the challenge process suggests we should devote considerable resources — global institutional liquidity.  As I have said before this is an area of potential vulnerability that has developed alongside the rapid globalisation of markets and of firms operating within them.  I personally feel that it has been somewhat overshadowed in recent times by work in other areas such as capital adequacy.  We feel that we can make a particular contribution here — both owing to our position in such a major global financial centre and because, in sterling at least, we are a potential provider of liquidity.  So we justify devoting significant resources to the analysis of liquidity issues, and the development of potential risk reduction strategies for liquidity problems — nationally and in particular internationally. At the other extreme, whilst we feel strongly about the desirability of robust and widely applied accounting standards — and are prepared to express 140 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — A framework for financial stability  A framework for financial stability — Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 141 our views on the big picture aspects of this from time to time — we do not devote significant resource to analysis, or lobbying in this area. (c)  Preparation for a financial crisis And finally, tail event territory though it may be, we need to undertake preparation for financial crises. We need to think forward to being ‘in-event’ where instability has actually been triggered, whether by a business failure of a firm or firms or by a terrorist or other disruptive event.  We need to prepare now, in advance, to enhance predictability at what would be a time of great uncertainty.  We need to know how we will work and communicate with public authorities and with the private sector. There is a different set of factors which impact our decisions in this area.  First, our ‘must do’ roles are dependent on crisis preparation and an adequate general understanding of how the financial system operates, with all the complexities entailed. Second, while each national authority has its specific responsibilities to fulfil, the speed with which decisions would then need to be made and actions implemented make it also essential to act effectively as a single operational unit.  In the United Kingdom the FSA, HMT and the Bank have developed mechanisms designed to turn this into reality and to provide necessary confidence to the market. And, third, through testing programmes, we can obtain feedback as to whether our efforts are likely to prove successful and to refine preparation as we go along. The costs to the economy of failure would be high and the expectation is that we would be well prepared. This puts a strong onus on collecting in advance up to date information on firms and markets, or being confident of its availability and source.  And also of regular and exacting testing programmes — working with other authorities and with the private sector. Conclusion So in conclusion, the field of financial stability oversight presents us with plenty of challenges.  Not only is the world more complex, but we need to devote real thought as to how best to operate and organise ourselves so as to contain risks. Defining the resources you need, and how to deploy them is challenging in itself.  My prediction is that as the system’s complexity increases all of us involved in the oversight of financial stability will find ourselves asking the same questions:  Just what should we do? Why?  And what effect will it have?  142 Financial Stability Review:  June 2005 — Bank of England publications Other Bank of England publications The Bank of England publishes information on all aspects of its work in many formats.

27/06/2017,"Financial Stability Report June 2017 | Issue No. 41   Financial Stability Report Presented to Parliament pursuant to Section 9W(10) of the Bank of England  Act 1998 as amended by the Financial Services Act 2012. June 2017 BANK OF ENGLAND  © Bank of England 2017 ISSN 1751-7044  BANK OF ENGLAND Financial Stability Report June 2017  |  Issue No. 41 The primary responsibility of the Financial Policy Committee (FPC), a committee of the Bank of England, is to contribute to the Bank of England’s objective for maintaining financial stability.  It does this primarily by identifying, monitoring and taking action to remove or reduce systemic risks, with a view to protecting and enhancing the resilience of the UK financial system.  Subject to that, it supports the economic policy of  Her Majesty’s Government, including its objectives for growth and employment.   This Financial Stability Report sets out the FPC’s view of the outlook for UK financial stability, including its assessment of the resilience of the UK financial system and the current main risks to financial stability, and the action it is taking to remove or reduce those risks.  It also reports on the activities of the Committee over the reporting period and on the extent to which the Committee’s previous policy actions have succeeded in meeting the Committee’s objectives.  The Report meets the requirement set out in legislation for the Committee to prepare and publish a Financial Stability Report twice per calendar year. In addition, the Committee has a number of duties, under the Bank of England Act 1998.  In exercising certain powers under this Act, the Committee is required to set out an explanation of its reasons for deciding to use its powers in the way they are being exercised and why it considers that to be compatible with its duties.  The Financial Policy Committee: Mark Carney, Governor Jon Cunliffe, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability Ben Broadbent, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy Sam Woods, Deputy Governor responsible for prudential regulation Andrew Bailey, Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority Alex Brazier, Executive Director for Financial Stability Strategy and Risk Anil Kashyap Donald Kohn Richard Sharp Martin Taylor Charles Roxburgh attends as the Treasury member in a non-voting capacity.

The FPC assesses the overall risks from the domestic environment to be at a standard level:  most financial stability indicators are neither particularly elevated nor subdued.   As is often the case in a standard environment, there are pockets of risk that warrant vigilance.  Consumer credit has increased rapidly.  Lending conditions in the mortgage market are becoming easier.  Lenders may be placing undue weight on the recent performance of loans in benign conditions. Exit negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union have begun.  There are a range of possible outcomes for, and paths to, the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU. Some possible global risks have not crystallised, though financial vulnerabilities in China remain pronounced. Measures of market volatility and the valuation of some assets — such as corporate bonds and UK commercial real estate — do not appear to reflect fully the downside risks that are implied by very low long-term interest rates. To ensure that the financial system has the resilience it needs, the FPC is:  •   Increasing the UK countercyclical capital buffer rate to 0.5%, from 0%.  Absent a material change in the outlook, and consistent with its stated policy for a standard risk environment and of moving gradually, the FPC expects to increase the rate to 1% at its November meeting.     •   Bringing forward the assessment of stressed losses on consumer credit lending in the Bank’s 2017 annual stress test.  This will inform the FPC’s assessment at its next meeting of any additional resilience required in aggregate against this lending.  The FPC further supports the intentions of the Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority to publish, in July, their expectations of lenders in the consumer credit market. •   Clarifying its existing insurance measures in the mortgage market, designed to prevent excessive growth in the number of highly indebted households.  This will promote consistency across lenders in their application of tests to assess whether new mortgage borrowers can afford repayments. •   Consistent with its previous commitment, restoring the level of resilience delivered by its leverage ratio standard to the level it delivered in July 2016 before the FPC excluded central bank reserves from the leverage ratio exposure measure.  The FPC intends to set the minimum leverage requirement at 3.25% of non-reserve exposures, subject to consultation.   •   Overseeing contingency planning to mitigate risks to financial stability as the United Kingdom withdraws from the European Union.  •   Building on the programme of cyber resilience testing it instigated in 2013, by setting out the essential elements of the regulatory framework for maintaining cyber resilience.  It will now monitor that each element is being fulfilled by the relevant UK authorities.   ii                                                                                                                                                             Financial Stability Report  June 2017 The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) assesses the overall risks from the domestic environment to be at a standard level:  most financial stability indicators are neither particularly elevated nor subdued.    As is often the case in a standard environment, there are pockets of risk that warrant vigilance.  Consumer credit has increased rapidly.  Lending conditions in the mortgage market are becoming easier.  Lenders may be placing undue weight on the recent performance of loans in benign conditions. The FPC is increasing the UK countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) rate to 0.5%, from 0% (see Box 1).  Absent a material change in the outlook, and consistent with its stated policy for a standard risk environment and of moving gradually, the FPC expects to increase the rate to 1% at its November meeting.     •    The action will supplement banks’ already substantial ability to absorb losses (Chart A). •    At its November meeting, the FPC will have the full set of results from the 2017 stress test of major UK banks. •    In line with its published policy, the FPC stands ready to cut the UK CCyB rate, as it did in July 2016, if a risk materialises that could lead to a material tightening of lending conditions.  Banks’ capital buffers exist to be used as necessary to allow banks to support the real economy in a downturn.   The FPC supports the intentions of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to publish, in July, their expectations of lenders in the consumer credit market.  Firms remain the first line of defence.  Effective governance at firms should ensure that risks are priced and managed appropriately and benign conditions do not lead to complacency by lenders.  The Bank’s annual stress test assesses banks’ resilience to risks in consumer credit.  Given the rapid growth in consumer credit over the past twelve months, the FPC is bringing forward the assessment of stressed losses on consumer credit lending in the Bank’s 2017 annual stress test.  This will inform the FPC’s assessment at its next meeting of any additional resilience required in aggregate against this lending.   •    Consumer credit grew by 10.3% in the twelve months to April 2017 (Chart B) — markedly faster than nominal household income growth.

Executive summary                                                                                                              iii •    Loss rates on consumer credit lending are low at present. Partly as a result, banks’ net interest margins on new lending have fallen and major lenders are using lower risk weights to calculate the capital they need to hold.  The current environment is also likely to have improved the credit scores of borrowers.   •    Other things equal, these developments mean lenders have less capacity to absorb losses, either with income or capital buffers.  In this context, a review by the PRA has found evidence of weaknesses in some aspects of underwriting and a reduction in resilience.   •    The short maturity of consumer credit means that the credit quality of the stock of lending can deteriorate quickly.  Lenders expect to continue to grow their portfolios this year, at the same time as real household income growth is expected to remain particularly weak. The FPC has clarified its existing insurance measures in the mortgage market, designed to prevent excessive growth in the number of highly indebted households.  Lenders should test affordability at their mortgage reversion rate — typically their standard variable rate — plus 3 percentage points.  This will promote consistency across lenders in their application of tests to assess whether new mortgage borrowers can afford repayments.   •    Historically, the build-up of mortgage debt has been a significant risk to financial and economic stability.  Because highly indebted borrowers need to cut spending sharply in a downturn, recessions become deeper.  And looser underwriting standards expose banks to bigger losses.   •    The FPC put policies in place to guard against these risks  in 2014.  These Recommendations were:  a limit on lending  at loan to income multiples at 4.5 or above;  and guidance to lenders to assess whether new borrowers would be  able to afford their repayments if interest rates were to  rise. •    Following a review (see The FPC’s approach to addressing risks from the UK mortgage market chapter), the FPC expects its measures to remain in place for the foreseeable future.   •    Mortgage lending at high loan to income ratios is increasing and the spreads and fees on mortgage lending have fallen. If lenders were to weaken underwriting standards to maintain mortgage growth, the FPC’s measures would  limit growth in the number of highly indebted households. This would have material benefits for economic and financial stability by mitigating the further cutbacks in spending that highly indebted households make in downturns.  Consistent with its previous commitment, the FPC is restoring the level of resilience delivered by its leverage ratio standard to the level it delivered in July 2016, before the FPC excluded central bank reserves from the leverage ratio exposure measure.  The FPC therefore intends to set the minimum leverage requirement at 3.25% of  non-reserve exposures, subject to consultation.    •    In July 2016, the FPC excluded central bank reserves from the measure of banks’ exposures used to assess their leverage.  This change reflected the special nature of central bank reserves and was designed to avoid a situation in which the Committee’s leverage standards impeded the transmission of monetary policy. •    The FPC committed last year that it would make an offsetting adjustment to ensure that the amount of capital needed to meet the UK leverage ratio standard would not decline.  The FPC did not intend for there to be a permanent loosening of the standard.  •    By raising the minimum leverage standard from 3% to 3.25%, the FPC intends to ensure that the original standard of resilience is restored, while also preserving the benefits of excluding central bank reserves from the exposure measure. Exit negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union have begun.  There are a range of possible outcomes for, and paths to, the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU.  The FPC will oversee contingency planning to mitigate risks to financial stability as the withdrawal process evolves (see Box 2). Irrespective of the particular form of the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the European Union, and consistent with its statutory responsibility, the FPC will remain committed to the implementation of robust prudential standards in the UK financial system.  This will require a level of resilience to be maintained that is at least as great as that currently planned, which itself exceeds that required by international baseline standards.   •    The United Kingdom’s position as the leading internationally active financial centre, with a financial centre that is, by asset size, around ten times GDP, means that the FPC’s statutory responsibility of protecting and enhancing the resilience of the UK financial system is particularly important for both the domestic and global economies. •    Absent consistent implementation of standards internationally and appropriate supervisory co-operation, the FPC would need to assess how best to protect the resilience of the UK financial system.  iv                                                                                                                                                            Financial Stability Report  June 2017 Some possible global risks have not crystallised, though financial vulnerabilities in China remain pronounced. Measures of market volatility and the valuation of some assets — such as corporate bonds and UK commercial real estate — do not appear to reflect fully the downside risks that are implied by very low long-term interest rates. Banks’ ability to withstand these risks is being tested in the 2017 stress test scenario. •    Euro-area sovereign bond spreads have fallen as some political uncertainties have been resolved.  Further progress has been made in strengthening European bank capital positions, and a domestically significant bank in Spain was resolved in an orderly fashion.  •    In China, capital outflows have stabilised, but economic growth continues to be accompanied by rapid credit expansion (Chart C).  •    Measures of uncertainty implied by options prices are low (see Asset valuations chapter).  Often in periods of low volatility, risks are building and later become apparent. •    In the United Kingdom, ten-year real government bond yields are at around -2% (Chart D).  Long-term real rates are low across the G7.  These levels are consistent with pessimistic growth expectations and high perceived tail risks. •    Some asset valuations, particularly for some corporate bonds and UK commercial real estate assets, appear to factor in a low level of long-term market interest rates but do not appear to be consistent with the pessimistic and uncertain outlook embodied in those rates (Chart E).  0 10 20 30 40 50 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 2006 08 10 12 14 16 Non-ﬁnancial sector(a) (right-hand scale) Adjusted total social ﬁnancing(b) (left-hand scale) Headline total social ﬁnancing(c) (left-hand scale) Percentage changes on a year earlier Per cent of GDP Chart C Credit continues to grow rapidly in China China non-financial sector debt and growth of total social financing Sources:  BIS total credit statistics, CEIC and Bank calculations.

The sustainable value of a property is the sum of discounted rental and sale proceeds.  The rental proceeds are discounted using a 5-year gilt yield plus a risk premium, and the sale proceeds are discounted using a 20-year, 5-year forward gilt yield plus a risk premium.  Expected rental value at the time of sale is based on Investment Property Forum Consensus forecasts.  The range of sustainable valuations represents varying assumptions about the rental yield at the time of sale:  either rental yields remain at their current levels (at the upper end), or rental yields revert to their 15-year historical average (at the lower end).

The impact of this could be amplified given reduced liquidity in some markets. Progress has been made in building resilience to cyber attack, but the risk continues to build and evolve. Regulators are nearing completion of a first round of cyber resilience testing for all firms at the core of the UK financial system, in line with the Recommendation from the FPC in 2015.   •    The FPC’s concern is to mitigate systemic risk — the risk of material disruption to the economy. •    With 31 out of 34 firms at the core of the UK financial system, including banks representing more than 80% of the outstanding stock of PRA-regulated banks’ lending to the UK real economy, so far having completed penetration testing and having action plans in place, the FPC is satisfied that its 2015 Recommendation has been met.   •    Consistent with that, the FPC is also setting out the essential elements of the regulatory framework for maintaining cyber resilience and will now monitor that each element is being fulfilled by the relevant UK authorities. •    Alongside the Bank, PRA and FCA, the FPC will now consider its tolerance for the disruption to important economic functions of the financial system in the event of cyber attack.   The FPC has updated its medium-term priorities (see  The FPC’s medium-term priorities chapter). •    The FPC’s primary responsibility is to identify, monitor and take action to remove or reduce systemic risks, with a view to protecting and enhancing the resilience of the UK financial system.  It aims to ensure the financial system does not cause problems for the rest of the economy and, if and when problems arise in the economy, the financial system can absorb rather than amplify them.   •    To help to meet its objectives, alongside its ongoing assessment of the risk environment, the FPC is prioritising three initiatives over the next two to three years: • Finalising, and refining if necessary, post-crisis bank capital and liquidity reforms. • Completing post-crisis reforms to market-based finance in the United Kingdom, and improving the assessment of systemic risks across the financial system. • Preparing for the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union. Part A of this Report sets out in detail the Committee’s analysis of the major risks and action it is taking in the light of those risks.  Part B summarises the Committee’s analysis of the resilience of the financial system.    vi                                                                                                                                                            Financial Stability Report  June 2017 Box 1 The FPC’s 2017 Q2 UK countercyclical capital buffer rate decision The FPC is increasing the UK countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) rate from 0% to 0.5%, with binding effect from  27 June 2018.  Absent a material change in the outlook, and consistent with its stated policy for a standard risk environment and of moving gradually, the FPC expects to increase the rate to 1% at its November meeting, with binding effect a year after that. At that point, it will have the full set of results from the 2017 stress test of major UK banks.   The increase to 0.5% will raise regulatory buffers of common equity Tier 1 capital by £5.7 billion.  This will provide a buffer of capital that can be released quickly in the event of an adverse shock occurring that threatens to tighten lending conditions.  The increase in the CCyB rate will also lead to a proportional increase in major UK banks’ leverage requirements via the countercyclical leverage buffer (CCLB).     The Committee’s decision to increase the UK CCyB rate to 0.5% — with an expectation of a further increase to 1% in November — reflects its assessment of the current risk environment and its intention to vary the buffer in gradual steps. In its published strategy for setting the CCyB, the FPC signalled that it expects to set a UK CCyB rate in the region of 1% in a standard risk environment.  The FPC assesses the overall risks from the domestic environment to be at a standard level:  most financial stability indicators are neither particularly elevated nor subdued.  Domestic credit has grown broadly in line with nominal GDP over the past two years (Chart A).  Within the overall risk environment, some indicators are more benign.  For example, despite high levels of indebtedness, private sector debt-servicing costs are low, supported by the low level of interest rates.  In contrast, risk levels in some sectors are more elevated, notably so in the consumer credit market (see UK consumer credit chapter). Global risks — which could influence the risks on UK exposures indirectly via their potential effects on UK economic growth — are also judged to be material, as are risks from some asset valuations. The FPC’s measured approach is likely to decrease the risk that banks adjust by tightening credit conditions, thereby minimising the cost to the economy of making the banking system more resilient. In line with its published policy, the FPC stands ready to cut the UK CCyB rate, as it did in July 2016, if a risk materialises that could lead to a material tightening of lending conditions. The cut in the CCyB rate in July 2016 was a response to greater uncertainty around the UK economic outlook and an increased possibility that material domestic risks could crystallise in the near term.  The FPC’s action served to ensure banks did not hoard capital and restrict lending in those conditions.  Banks’ capital buffers exist to be used as necessary to allow banks to support the real economy in a downturn.   Under EU law, the UK CCyB rate applies automatically (up to a 2.5% limit, and currently subject to a transition timetable) to the UK exposures of firms incorporated in other European Economic Area (EEA) states.  The FPC expects it to apply also to internationally active banks in jurisdictions outside the EEA that have implemented the Basel III regulatory standards. Consistent with this, recent CCyB actions by Czech Republic, Hong Kong and Norway have been reciprocated. 5 0 5 10 15 2000 02 04 06 08 10 12 14 16 Nominal GDP   growth rate(b) Bank credit(a) Per cent + – Chart A Credit directly financed by the banking system has grown broadly in line with nominal GDP over the past two years Growth in credit to households and firms compared with nominal GDP growth Sources:  ONS and Bank calculations.

This initiated, under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, a two-year period for the  United Kingdom and the European Union to negotiate and conclude a withdrawal agreement.  The exit negotiations have now begun. As the FPC stated in September 2016, irrespective of the particular form of the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the European Union, and consistent with its statutory responsibility, the FPC will remain committed to the implementation of robust prudential standards in the UK financial system.  This will require a level of resilience to be maintained that is at least as great as that currently planned and which itself exceeds that required by international baseline standards.(1) In addition, consistent with its statutory duty, the FPC will continue to identify and monitor UK financial stability risks, so that preparations can be made and action taken to mitigate them.   There are a range of possible outcomes for the  United Kingdom’s future relationship with the European Union and possible paths to that relationship.  Consistent with its remit, the FPC is focused on scenarios that, even if they may be the least likely to occur, could have most impact on  UK financial stability.  This includes a scenario in which there is no agreement in place at the point of exit.  Such scenarios are where contingency planning and preparation will be most valuable.    The Bank, FCA and PRA are working closely with regulated firms and financial market infrastructures (FMIs) to ensure they have comprehensive contingency plans in place.  The FPC will oversee contingency planning to mitigate risks to financial stability as the withdrawal process unfolds. Through this work, the FPC is aiming to promote an  orderly adjustment to the new relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union. Without contingency plans that can be executed in the available time, effects on financial stability could arise both through direct effects on the provision of financial services, and indirectly, through macroeconomic shocks that could test the resilience of the financial system.   (1)  Direct effects on the provision of financial services A very large part of the United Kingdom’s legal and regulatory framework for financial services is directly or indirectly derived from EU law.  The United Kingdom’s financial services law must therefore become domestic at the point of withdrawal. The Government plans to execute this through the Repeal Bill.  Once enacted, this will ensure there is no legal or regulatory vacuum in respect of financial services when the United Kingdom leaves the European Union. The European Union’s framework for financial services establishes the right of financial companies within the European Economic Area (EEA) to provide services across national borders and to establish local branches in other Member States without local authorisation.   This promotes substantial cross-border provision of a wide range of financial services.  Around £40 billion of UK financial services revenues relate to EU clients and markets.(2) These  cross-border connections have resulted in more efficient financial services for businesses and households across the European Union.  There is no generally applicable institutional framework for cross-border provision of financial services outside the European Union.  Globally, liberalisation of trade in services lags far behind liberalisation of trade in goods.  So without a new bespoke agreement, UK firms could no longer provide services to EEA clients (and vice versa) in the same manner as they do today, or in some cases not at all.  This creates two broad risks.  First, services could be dislocated as clients and providers adjust.  Second, the fragmentation of service provision could increase costs and risks.   In the United Kingdom, the flow of new banking and insurance services to UK customers could be disrupted if EEA firms are unable to operate in the United Kingdom in  the same manner as they do today.  Around 10% of the outstanding stock of loans to private non-financial corporations in the United Kingdom is extended by  UK branches of EEA banks.(3) Around 7% of general insurance contracts undertaken in the United Kingdom and 3% of life insurance contracts are written by EEA insurers.(4) As well as disrupting new business from these providers, fragmentation could require the existing contracts to be transferred to a UK-authorised firm in order to address any legal uncertainties as to the status of, and ability to perform, such contracts.

EU clients would need to source substitute services from banks and FMIs established in the EEA or other countries recognised by the European Commission as ‘equivalent’.  This is particularly relevant to new debt and equity issuance and derivatives business.  These dislocations could also disrupt  the provision of services to UK clients who rely on EU counterparties.  UK-located banks underwrite around half of the debt and equity issued by EU companies.(1) EU companies could need to find alternative providers of this service to sustain their capital market issuance.  UK-located banks are counterparty to over half of the  over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives traded by  EU companies and banks.(2) To support EU-based derivatives trading, substantial operational capacity may need to be established in the European Union and additional capital and balance sheet capacity would probably be needed.  Central counterparties (CCPs) located in the  United Kingdom provide services to EU clients in a range of markets.  The United Kingdom houses some of the world’s largest CCPs.  For example, LCH handles over 90% of cleared interest rate swaps globally.   In addition to the potential disruption to new clearing business for EU firms, if EU firms are unable to move their existing derivatives contracts to EU authorised or recognised CCPs, they would face capital charges that are up to ten times higher.  Moreover, to move a large stock of existing trades will pose substantial and complex operational and legal challenges. In addition to the dislocation of services, fragmentation of market-based finance could result in higher costs and greater risks for both EU and UK companies and households.   Separation of derivatives clearing would reduce the benefits of central clearing.  It would impair the ability to diversify risks across borders and, by increasing costs, reduce incentives for firms to hedge risks.  Industry estimates suggest that a single basis point increase in cost resulting from splitting clearing of interest rate swaps could cost EU firms €22 billion per year across all of their business.  Delegation of asset management across borders is a  well-established practice.  For example, 40% of the assets managed in the United Kingdom are managed for overseas clients;  around half of this activity is on behalf of clients outside Europe.(3) UK-located asset managers account for 37% of all assets managed in Europe.(4) If asset management were to fragment between the United Kingdom and Europe, material economies of scale and scope that are currently achieved by pooling of funds and their management would be reduced.   Together, these effects could increase the reliance of both the UK and EU economies on their banking systems and reduce the diversification and resilience of finance.     (2)  Macroeconomic shocks that could test the resilience of         the financial system To maintain consistent provision of financial services to the UK economy, the financial system must be able to absorb  the impacts on their balance sheets of any adverse  economic shocks that could arise in some scenarios for the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union.   The Bank of England’s regular stress testing aims to ensure that the banking system has the strength to withstand, and continue to lend in, a broad and severe economic and market shock.   The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union has the potential to affect the economy through supply, demand and exchange rate channels.(5) The supply side of the economy could be disrupted by abrupt increases in the costs of, or obstacles to, cross-border trade. Demand could be impacted by the abrupt introduction of restrictions on exports of financial and other services and tariffs on trade in goods with the European Union.  A reduction in economic activity in high tax-paying sectors could affect public finances and spending. In some scenarios, heightened uncertainty could also reinforce the existing risk of a fall in appetite of foreign investors for  UK assets.  The United Kingdom relies on inflows of overseas capital to finance its current account deficit — the excess of investment over domestic saving.  That deficit, which stood at 4.4% of GDP in 2016, is financed largely through direct investment and portfolio investment in the form of long-term debt and equity (Chart A).   A material reduction in the appetite of foreign investors to provide finance to the United Kingdom would tighten financing conditions for UK borrowers and reduce asset prices (1) Based on Bank analysis of UK-located investment banks’ revenues in 2015 for M&A and debt/equity issuance activities, using multiple sources.

Executive summary                                                                                                              ix and investment.  The effect could be most pronounced in markets that have recently had greater reliance on access to overseas capital, such as commercial real estate (CRE). Around half of the investment in UK CRE since 2015 has been financed by overseas investors (Chart B). All else equal, economic shocks like these would probably depress the exchange rate, putting upward pressure on inflation.  The combination of shocks could therefore possibly create a more challenging trade-off for monetary policy.  The Monetary Policy Committee would have to make careful judgements about the net effect of these influences on demand, supply and inflation.   In these circumstances, the maintenance of financial stability would require banks to be able to withstand, and continue lending in, an environment of higher loan impairments, increased risk of default on other assets, and lower asset prices and collateral values. Mitigating risks to financial stability The FPC will continue to assess the resilience of the UK financial system to adverse economic shocks that could arise. The FPC will use the information from its regular stress testing of major UK banks and building societies.  These test banks’ resilience to a range of relevant scenarios, including a snap back of interest rates, sharp adjustment in UK property markets, and severe stress in the euro area.   The FPC will continue to assess the suitability of firms’ contingency plans for emerging risks, in the context of progress on agreements and the continuity of the domestic regulatory framework.  This will draw on reviews by the Bank, PRA and FCA of firms’ plans, including responses from banks, insurers and designated investment firms to the PRA’s  April 2017 letter requesting that they summarise their contingency plans for the full range of possible scenarios following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the  European Union.   20 10 0 10 20 30 2011 12 13 14 15 16 Portfolio investment(b) Foreign direct investment (FDI) Other investment(c) Reserves and net derivatives Total net inward ﬁnancing ﬂow(d) Current account deﬁcit + – Per cent of GDP     Chart A The United Kingdom has relied on material inflows of portfolio investment and FDI to finance its current account deficit in recent years Net inward financing flows(a) Sources:  ONS and Bank calculations.

The FPC’s approach to addressing risks from the UK mortgage market                                                                                                                                                                Part A The FPC’s approach to addressing risks from the UK mortgage market        1 Summary Buying a house is the biggest investment that many people will make in their lives, and it is typically financed by debt. In the United Kingdom, mortgages are households’ largest liability and lenders’ largest loan exposure.  The FPC’s concern is with risks to the resilience of both borrowers and lenders that arise from high levels of household debt.  While a significant factor contributing to high levels of house prices relative to incomes in the United Kingdom has been the relatively limited growth in the stock of housing, the main drivers of housing supply are not under the control of the Bank of England or the FPC.  Consumer protection, meanwhile, remains the responsibility of the FCA. Historically, the build-up of mortgage debt has been a key source of risk to financial and economic stability: • Highly indebted households are more vulnerable to unexpected falls in their incomes or increases in their mortgage repayments.   • In an economic downturn, they do all they can to pay their mortgages, but — as a result — may have to cut spending sharply, making the downturn worse. • In doing so, they also increase the risk of losses to lenders, not just on mortgages, but on other lending too. Build-ups of mortgage debt can be self-reinforcing.  Lenders’ underwriting standards can turn quickly from responsible to reckless:  • Housing is the main source of collateral in the real economy, so higher house prices tend to lead to higher levels of mortgage lending, feeding back into higher valuations. • In an upturn, when risks are perceived to be low, lenders’ underwriting standards can loosen quickly, as they seek to maintain or build market share.  This increases the supply of credit further. To insure against these risks, in June 2014 the FPC introduced a policy package, designed to prevent a significant increase in the number of highly indebted households and a marked loosening in underwriting standards.  The two FPC Recommendations were to: • limit the proportion of mortgages extended at high  loan to income ratios;  and • promote minimum standards for how lenders test affordability for borrowers. These measures were not expected to restrain housing market activity unless lenders’ underwriting standards eased.  They were put in place as insurance and complement the annual stress tests of major lenders, which test that lenders can withstand sharp economic downturns, including large falls in house prices, while also continuing to lend. The FPC views its Recommendations as likely to remain in place for the foreseeable future.  It judges that their benefits would increase if they became more binding relative to lenders’ underwriting standards.  The FPC will continue to review their calibration on a regular basis. The FPC has clarified its affordability test Recommendation to ensure consistency in its application across lenders.  The Committee has recommended that: • When assessing affordability, mortgage lenders should apply an interest rate stress test that assesses whether borrowers could still afford their mortgages if, at any point over the first five years of the loan, their mortgage rate were to be 3 percentage points higher than the reversion rate specified in the mortgage contract at origination. This Recommendation can alternatively be interpreted as introducing a ‘safety margin’ between current mortgage payments and current income, also ensuring that the household sector as a whole is better able to withstand adverse shocks to income and employment. The housing market can be a key source of risk to financial stability Housing accounts for nearly half of the total assets of UK households.  And around two thirds of house purchases are financed by mortgage debt. Housing has been at the heart of many financial crises.  Since the 1950s, there has been a material rise in mortgage debt across advanced economies, driving a major expansion of the balance sheet of the financial sector.  More than two thirds of the 46 systemic banking crises for which house price data are  2                                                                                                                                                             Financial Stability Report  June 2017 available were preceded by housing boom-bust cycles.(1) Mortgage booms have also tended to be followed by periods of considerably slower economic growth than non-mortgage credit booms, irrespective of whether a financial crisis occurred or not.(2) Mortgages are the largest liability of UK households. They can be a source of risk for borrowers’ resilience and broader economic activity. Over the past 20 years, house prices have risen significantly relative to incomes, so households have to borrow more to buy a house.  The resulting high levels of household debt expose the UK economy to the risk of sharp cuts in consumption in the face of shocks to income or interest rates. A significant factor contributing to high levels of house prices relative to incomes in the United Kingdom (Chart A.1)(3) has been the relatively limited growth in the stock of housing.  The absolute level of house prices may further reflect a protracted decline in interest rates.  Over the past 50 years, the number of new houses built each year in the United Kingdom has more than halved, from a peak of 426,000 in 1968 (Chart A.2).  Since 1982, this number has averaged less than 190,000, while the UK population has increased by around 265,000 per year.(4) Partly as a result, the cost of renting a property — as well as buying it — can be high relative to household incomes in parts of the country.  In the 2016 NMG survey, around one third of respondents who lived in rented accommodation reported that their rental payments were 30% or more of their pre-tax incomes.  The main drivers of housing supply are not under the control of the Bank of England or the FPC, and are partly related to the planning system.(5) Long-term real interest rates have been declining across advanced economies for several decades.  Global structural factors — such as demographics — are likely to have been the primary driver of these falls, which have contributed to a rise in the level of house prices.(6) In recent months, annual house price inflation has weakened;  in May 2017 house prices rose at the slowest annual rate since May 2013.(7) But while respondents to the RICS survey in May 2017 expected the slowdown to continue in the near term, they expected prices to rise over the next year.  Building up a deposit to buy a house has become more difficult.  The average house price for first-time buyers increased from around £50,000 in 1997 to over £200,000 in 2016.  Over the same period, the size of a typical deposit for a first-time buyer increased from less than £5,000 to over £30,000.

Part A The FPC’s approach to addressing risks from the UK mortgage market       3 around 6% of renters aged 45 or younger have financial assets worth £30,000 or more, and that only 11% have £15,000 or more. The increase in house prices relative to incomes in recent decades has contributed to a rise in UK household indebtedness, which is currently high by historical standards. Since the late 1980s, the outstanding stock of mortgage debt has nearly doubled and represents the majority of the aggregate household debt to income (DTI) ratio (Chart A.3). During the financial crisis, countries that had initially higher levels of household debt relative to income saw larger falls in aggregate consumption (Chart A.4), putting downward pressure on broader economic activity.  Analysis of household-level data also suggests that individual households with higher mortgage debt relative to income adjust spending more sharply in response to shocks.  For example, data from the Living Costs and Food Survey show that, during the financial crisis, the fall in consumption relative to income among UK households with loan to income (LTI) ratios above four was around three times larger than the fall for those with ratios between one and two (Chart A.5).  Econometric studies confirm these results, even after controlling for other household characteristics.(1) Given the ‘full-recourse’ nature of UK mortgage contracts, borrowers in the United Kingdom typically do all they can to pay their mortgages rather than default, including cutting back sharply on spending. In the United Kingdom, if a borrower defaults on a mortgage and the value of the house does not cover the outstanding mortgage, the lender has a claim against other assets of the debtor.  This contrasts with some other jurisdictions, such as the United States, where ‘non-recourse’ mortgages are more widespread.

In summary, mortgage debt can be a source of risk for borrowers’ ability to weather downturns without substantial cutbacks in their spending.  UK household indebtedness is high, which can be a threat to the wider economy.  Highly indebted households can cut back sharply on spending in response to adverse shocks to incomes or interest rates, putting downward pressure on economic activity and reducing the resilience of the financial system. Mortgages are the largest loan exposure for UK lenders. They can be a source of risk for lenders’ resilience, impairing the provision of credit. In a severe downturn, some borrowers will be unable to repay their mortgages even after cutting back on spending, for example, in the event of a rise in unemployment.  The resulting defaults can affect lenders’ resilience, with mortgages accounting for around two thirds of major UK banks’ loans to UK borrowers.(2) The proportion of households experiencing repayment difficulties can rise sharply as the share of income spent on servicing mortgage debt — also known as the mortgage debt-servicing ratio (DSR) — increases beyond a certain level (Chart A.6).  Both the average DSR of the UK household sector as a whole and the proportion of households with high mortgage DSRs have fallen since the crisis, supported by the low level of interest rates.  But households’ ability to service their mortgage debt could be challenged by either a rise in mortgage rates or a fall in incomes.  As an illustration, Bank staff estimate that in the event of a rise in unemployment to 8%, the proportion of households with high DSRs would double, reaching a level close to that seen in 2007 (Chart A.7). During the global financial crisis, loss rates on mortgages were contained, reflecting the sharp fall in interest rates and a rise in unemployment that was relatively modest given the fall in economic activity.(3) But in the 1990s recession, which was marked by a significant rise in interest rates and unemployment, loss rates were more material.(4) And results from stress tests of major UK banks suggest that they could reach similar levels in future periods of severe stress (Chart A.8), particularly if house prices were to fall significantly, increasing lenders’ losses in the event of borrower default. Significant falls in house prices are highly correlated with economic downturns, when borrowers are also more likely to become unemployed and default on their mortgages.  In such a severe stress, lenders are likely to incur larger losses on lending originally extended at high LTV ratios.  This is because such mortgages are more likely to experience ‘negative equity’ in the event of a fall in house prices, meaning that the value of the housing collateral will be less likely to cover the mortgage loan. 0 4 8 12 16 20 0–5 5–10 10–15 15–20 20–25 25–30 30–35 35–40 40–50 50+ NMG survey   (2014–15, arrears 2 months+) Wealth and Assets Survey   (2010–12, arrears 2 months+) Percentage of mortgagors in arrears(a) Mortgage DSR, per cent Chart A.6 Households with high debt-servicing ratios (DSRs) are more likely to experience repayment difficulties Households in two-month arrears by mortgage DSR Sources:  NMG Consulting survey, Wealth and Assets Survey and Bank calculations.

Part A The FPC’s approach to addressing risks from the UK mortgage market       5 The provision of high LTV lending has increased from its post-crisis lows recently, but both the annual average total volume of high LTV lending and its share of total mortgage lending remain lower than at any point between 1982 and 2008 (Chart A.9).  At the same time, LTV ratios for outstanding loans have fallen as a result of house price growth and mortgagors repaying existing debt.  As a result, for example, only 2% of the major six lenders’ stock of mortgages had an LTV above 90% at end-2016 (Chart A.10). High mortgage debt can also affect lenders’ resilience indirectly. In a downturn, highly indebted households prioritising mortgage payments may default on their other credit commitments, such as credit cards or personal loans. Sharp cuts in consumption that amplify the downturn can also lead to credit losses on other types of lending, for example loans to businesses.   Overall, in a severe stress, high levels of mortgage debt could lead to significant losses (both directly and indirectly) and reduce the resilience of lenders, impairing the provision of credit to the real economy and further intensifying an economic downturn. Self-reinforcing feedback loops between levels of mortgage lending and house prices can amplify risks to both borrowers and lenders. Housing is the main source of collateral in the real economy, so higher house prices tend to lead to higher levels of mortgage lending, feeding back into higher valuations. As valuations increase, rising wealth for existing homeowners and higher collateral values for lenders can increase both the demand for, and supply of, credit, leading to a self-reinforcing loop between levels of mortgage lending and house prices.  Expectations of future house price increases can also prompt prospective buyers to bring forward house purchases.  The resulting rapid growth in mortgage lending can amplify risks to both lenders and borrowers. 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 1991–95 2009–13 2014 stress test 2015 stress test 2016 stress test Per cent Cumulative ﬁve-year loss rates Estimated loss rates incurred by insurers Chart A.8 Loss rates on UK mortgages could reach material levels in a severe stress Cumulative five-year loss rates on UK mortgages in past downturns and in stress tests(a)(b)(c)(d)(e) Sources:  Acadametrics, Bank of England, lenders’ stress-testing submissions and Bank calculations.

This increases the supply of credit further. Underwriting standards on UK mortgages weakened in the lead-up to the financial crisis, contributing to the growth in mortgage lending and house prices.  Across a range of metrics, underwriting standards are now more robust relative to the period before the crisis.  But market contacts suggest that lending conditions in the mortgage market are becoming easier and competitive pressures in the mortgage market remain.  Mortgage spreads over risk-free rates have fallen materially since their peak in 2012 (Chart A.11).  Lenders are also extending an increasing proportion of mortgages without fees.  Forty-six per cent of mortgages were extended without fees in the first part of 2017, compared to 37% in 2016 and just 12% in 2011 (Chart A.12). A similar feedback loop between house prices and credit also arises in a downturn.  An economic slowdown can reduce house prices.  Due to the role of housing as collateral, lower house prices reduce the demand for, and supply of, credit. Expectations of further price reductions, which can result in sales of houses at heavily discounted prices (‘fire sales’), can further amplify house price falls, reinforcing the adverse feedback loop.  The resulting deterioration in borrowers’  and lenders’ resilience will intensify a downturn  (Figure A.1). Growth in the private rental sector in recent years may have led to growing risks of amplified house price cycles from leveraged buy-to-let investors.(1) The share of households in the private rental sector rose from around 10% in 2002 to 20% in 2016.  Buy-to-let investors do not live in the house that they rent out and their behaviour is more likely to be driven by their expected returns on their housing investment than that of owner-occupiers.  But if either house prices or the income received from rental payments were to fall materially, there is a risk that some leveraged investors may look to sell their properties quickly, reinforcing house price falls in a downturn.   The size of the buy-to-let segment of the mortgage market has almost doubled since the period before the crisis (Chart A.13).  So the impact of a growing share of leveraged investors on the dynamics of the broader market in a stress Expectations of further price reductions and ‘ﬁre sales’ Collateral effect Adverse shock House price fall Reduction in demand for and supply of credit Figure A.1 Feedback loops between mortgage credit and house prices can amplify a downturn 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 2011 12 13 14 15 16 17 Per cent Proportion of £0 fee new mortgages Chart A.12 The proportion of mortgages with no fees has increased Proportion of new mortgages with no fees(a) Sources:  Moneyfacts and Bank calculations.

Part A The FPC’s approach to addressing risks from the UK mortgage market       7 has yet to be tested.  But there is evidence of this channel operating in the United States in the financial crisis.  In those US states that experienced the largest housing booms and busts, at the peak of the market almost half of mortgage originations were associated with investors.(1) The FPC has taken action to mitigate risks to both borrowers’ and lenders’ resilience Given the importance of the UK mortgage market for financial stability, the FPC and the Bank have taken action in recent years to mitigate risks to both borrowers’ resilience, where this can impact broader economic activity, and to lenders’ resilience.   In June 2014, the FPC introduced two Recommendations, which:  limit the proportion of mortgages with high LTI ratios; and promote minimum standards for how banks test affordability for borrowers. Also in 2014, following a Recommendation by the FPC, the Bank introduced annual stress tests of the UK banking system.   In September 2016, the PRA published a Supervisory Statement setting out its expectations for minimum underwriting standards on buy-to-let mortgages, in particular on how lenders test affordability. Parliament has also given the FPC powers of Direction,(2) which can cover both owner-occupier and buy-to-let mortgage lending. Table A.1 summarises the Bank’s toolkit to deal with risks from the UK mortgage market.   Insuring against risks to borrowers’ resilience The FPC’s Recommendations insure against a further significant rise in the number of highly indebted households and a marked loosening in underwriting standards. The ‘affordability test’ Recommendation was designed to insure against a loosening in lenders’ standards for assessing mortgage affordability.  It builds on the FCA’s rules that require lenders to assess whether prospective borrowers could afford their mortgage, taking into account their income, spending patterns and potential future interest rate increases.   At the time of the original Recommendation in 2014, most major lenders tested whether prospective borrowers could afford their mortgages assuming a stressed mortgage rate of around 7%.  That compared with prevailing mortgage reversion rates(3) in the region of 4%–4½%.  In order to insure against a relaxation of those standards, the FPC recommended that all mortgage lenders should assess whether borrowers could still afford their mortgages if Bank Rate were to increase by 3 percentage points — the idea being that this increase would feed through to lenders’ reversion rates, to result in a stressed mortgage rate in the region of 7%. The affordability test can alternatively be interpreted as introducing a ‘safety margin’ between current mortgage payments and current incomes.  This margin seeks to ensure that the household sector is better able to withstand fluctuations in income and employment.

The 4.5 multiple was calibrated to ensure that, at a stressed mortgage rate of 7% and a typical mortgage term of around 25 years, mortgagors’ stressed DSRs would not exceed 35%–40%.  That is the point beyond which the proportion of mortgagors that start experiencing repayment difficulties can rise sharply (Chart A.6).  The 15% flow at or above the 4.5 threshold ensures that access to high LTI mortgages remains for those borrowers who can afford it. The affordability test and the LTI flow limit complement each other in protecting households’ ability to service their debt. The affordability test effectively sets an LTI cap for each borrower that depends primarily on the term of the mortgage, or ‘tenor’, and the borrower’s spending commitments.  The relationship between the effective LTI cap and the mortgage term is illustrated in Chart A.14.  The swathe reflects variations in the effective cap, depending on the borrower’s spending commitments and the precise stressed interest rate used by lenders to assess affordability.  For borrowers seeking a relatively short mortgage term, the affordability test effectively places a lower cap on LTIs than the threshold implied by the LTI flow limit.  This is because, at short tenors, a given loan amount will have higher debt-servicing costs due to higher capital repayments. In 2016, less than 20% of new mortgages had a tenor of fifteen years or less. Chart A.14 also shows that the LTI flow limit can act as a simple backstop to the more complex affordability test:  the LTI flow limit would be more likely to bind if mortgage terms increased, or if lenders loosened the standards through which they assess affordability (eg the approach to accounting for other spending commitments).  Other things equal, such changes would move the effective LTI cap implied by the affordability test towards the top of the swathe. The FPC judges that its Recommendations have had only a modest impact on mortgage lending to date. In November 2016, the FPC reviewed the two Recommendations.  The Committee assessed that, since their introduction in June 2014, they had had only a modest impact on mortgage lending, as lenders’ own underwriting standards had not loosened.  The Committee also judged that the Recommendations continued to insure against a deterioration in underwriting standards.(2) The Committee retains both of these judgements. LTI flow limit. In aggregate, lenders are advancing around 10% of new mortgages at LTIs at or above 4.5 (Chart A.15).  So there remains headroom for further high LTI lending in aggregate.  In February 2017, the PRA changed the relevant measure from a fixed quarterly limit to a four-quarter rolling limit, which should further help lenders manage their business pipeline.(3) One feature of recent lending has been a ‘bunching’ of loans just below the FPC’s 4.5 LTI limit.  In part, this is likely to represent some individuals being constrained to smaller loans than they would have otherwise obtained.  Bank staff estimate the size of this impact to be small in aggregate:  for example, if the share of borrowers with an LTI between 4 and 4.5 were to be returned to its level before the FPC Recommendations were made, and the remaining borrowers in that category were to obtain an LTI of 5 instead, the value of total mortgage lending would increase by less than 1%. Affordability test. The impact of the FPC’s affordability test is more difficult to assess because the total number of prospective borrowers who fail the test is not directly observable.  Nevertheless, in November 2016 the FPC judged that the Recommendation had not been excluding a significant number of borrowers.

(a)  Swathe for affordability test assumes borrowers have 30% to 50% of gross income available to support mortgage repayments, and lenders assess affordability at stress interest rates of 6.75% to 7%. (b)  The FPC flow limit restricts the share of new mortgages at LTIs of 4.5 or greater to 15%. (1) For example, analysis by Bank staff suggests that the proportion of households that would have a DSR greater than 40% in the face of an interest rate shock of 300 basis points is broadly equivalent to the proportion of households that would have a DSR greater than 40% in the face of an unemployment shock of around 3 percentage points.  And empirical relationships between aggregate arrears and macroeconomic variables suggest that the proportion of households that would be in arrears if interest rates were to rise by 300 basis points is broadly equivalent to the proportion of households that would be in arrears if unemployment increased by just under 2%.

Part A The FPC’s approach to addressing risks from the UK mortgage market       9 analysis of trends in mortgage applications and information received from a sample of lenders, suggesting that the calibration of the affordability test was not resulting in a material proportion of mortgage enquiries being rejected, even prior to the formal application stage.  Two further pieces of evidence support this conclusion: • First, while there has been a long-run trend towards longer mortgage terms since the crisis, there has been no acceleration in that trend since the introduction of the affordability test (Chart A.16).  Were the policy to be excluding a large number of prospective mortgagors, borrowers could seek to pass the test by lengthening mortgage tenor, which lowers monthly repayments. • Second, first-time buyers, who might have been expected to be most affected by any measure that restricts loan size relative to income, have maintained their share of total mortgage lending at around a third since 2014. The FPC has further considered the possible impact of its Recommendations in different hypothetical scenarios. The Committee judges that, in the event that they were to become more binding relative to lenders’ own underwriting standards, their benefits would also increase.  The FPC expects them to remain in place for the foreseeable future. As an example, in a hypothetical ‘upside’ scenario where a loosening of underwriting standards pushes mortgage lending higher and leads to an increase in the aggregate house price to income ratio, the absence of policies would lead to a significant increase in the number of highly indebted households.  Specifically, the share of new mortgages extended at an LTI multiple at or above 4.5 would be 40% by the end of the scenario, compared with 13% if the policies were in place (Chart A.17).  Over time, this would lead to a significant deterioration in the distribution of the stock of household debt.  The benefits of the FPC’s Recommendations under this scenario include:   • By limiting the number of highly indebted households, the policies reduce the potential for cuts in consumption in response to adverse shocks.  There are significant uncertainties around the relationship between household indebtedness and cuts in consumption.  But mapping estimates based on international evidence (Table A.2) onto the distribution of debt with and without policies suggests 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 2005 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Per cent of new mortgages 4 ≤ LTI < 4.5 LTI ≥ 4.5 LTI ≥ 5 Chart A.15 There remains headroom for further high LTI lending in aggregate Flow of new mortgages by LTI(a)(b) Sources:  FCA Product Sales Database and Bank calculations.

For example, by preventing a marked loosening in underwriting standards, they reduce the risk of a self-reinforcing feedback loop between mortgage lending and house prices, which could amplify any fall in house prices.   The macroeconomic costs of the FPC’s Recommendations arise from their impact on housing market activity — and therefore broader economic activity — in these scenarios.  • Because they constrain mortgage approvals in scenarios in which underwriting standards loosen, the FPC’s policies may also have some effect on consumer spending.  For example, moving house is often associated with a greater propensity to purchase durable goods, such as furniture and household appliances.(1) In the hypothetical ‘upside’ scenario, the Recommendations are estimated to reduce the level of nominal GDP by around 0.2% by the end of the scenario.  • The Committee further judges that it is unlikely that a restriction on mortgage credit supply would have a material effect on the economy’s longer-term growth rate or productive capacity.  So the costs of the policies would be temporary, while the benefits of increased resilience would persist. In reaching its judgement, the FPC considered different scenarios constructed by staff.  These pointed to the benefits of policy rising as it became increasingly binding relative to lenders’ own underwriting standards. The FPC’s existing Recommendations cover the owner-occupier mortgage market.  The FPC also has a power of Direction over interest coverage ratio (ICR) limits on buy-to-let mortgages.  It has not yet used this power as it judges that the PRA Supervisory Statement currently provides adequate insurance against a loosening of underwriting standards in the buy-to-let market (Box 3). Insuring against risks to lenders’ resilience The FPC’s Recommendations protect the resilience of lenders by reducing the probability that new borrowers will default on their mortgages.  They complement the framework of bank capital requirements, which seeks to ensure that lenders can withstand sharp economic slowdowns, including large falls in house prices, while continuing to lend.   Banks are required to hold more capital against riskier loans.(2) For example, lenders allocate more capital to mortgages with higher LTV ratios (Chart A.18) because, in the event of a severe house price fall, higher LTV ratios would result in larger losses on defaulted mortgages. The Bank’s stress-testing framework assesses whether banks hold enough capital to withstand a severe stress and continue to lend to the real economy.  The ‘annual cyclical scenario’ includes sharp falls in house prices (eg a 33% fall in the 2017 scenario).  These stress scenarios are more severe if risks from the housing and mortgage market are judged to have increased, other things equal.(3) And, for a given macroeconomic shock, losses in the stress test will increase with the riskiness of lenders’ portfolios (eg due to more high LTV lending).  Taken together, this leads to a countercyclical capitalisation of the banks, strengthening their resilience against risks from the mortgage market.   Where stress tests show banks need bigger buffers of capital to absorb the stress scenarios, the FPC can take action by raising the UK countercyclical capital buffer rate, and the Table A.2 More highly indebted mortgagors made larger spending cuts during the crisis Cuts in consumption between 2007 and 2009 among mortgagors with different LTI ratios  LTI ratio            United Kingdom(a)                        Denmark(b)(c)                          Norway(b)(d)                                           (per cent)                                (per cent)                                (per cent) 0 to 1                                          -1.4                                            1.2                                            1.9 1 to 2                                          -4.2                                            1.9                                          -6.3 2 to 3                                          -7.0                                            1.0                                         -11.5 3 to 4                                         -9.8                                          -2.3                                        -21.3 4 to 5                                        -12.6                                          -5.8                                       -28.9 5 to 6                                           n.a.                                          -7.9                                           n.a.

(2) Lenders have to be funded by capital in proportion to the risks they take.  To compute the required amount of capital, lenders ‘risk weight’ their loans.  They calculate risk weights either by using a ‘standardised approach’ set internationally or, if allowed by their national supervisor, by using their own risk parameters — the ‘internal ratings based’ (IRB) approach’.

Part A The FPC’s approach to addressing risks from the UK mortgage market      11 Prudential Regulation Committee (which is responsible for promoting the safety and soundness of individual banks)(1) can raise the regulatory capital buffers of individual lenders. The FPC has not yet used its powers of Direction over LTV limits.  The Committee judges that the measures in place are proportionate to current risks (Box 4). The FPC regularly reviews the calibration and implementation of its Recommendations   The FPC has withdrawn and replaced the affordability test Recommendation in order to promote consistency of implementation across lenders, with the aim of insuring against a future loosening in underwriting standards (Box 5).  The new Recommendation states that: When assessing affordability, mortgage lenders should apply an interest rate stress test that assesses whether borrowers could still afford their mortgages if, at any point over the first five years of the loan, their mortgage rate were to be 3 percentage points higher than the reversion rate specified in the mortgage contract at the time of origination (or, if the mortgage contract does not specify a reversion rate, 3 percentage points higher than the product rate at origination).  This Recommendation is intended to be read together with the FCA requirements around considering the effect of future interest rate rises as set out in (1) On 1 March 2017, as the PRA ceased to be a subsidiary of the Bank and its functions were fully transferred to the Bank, the PRA Board became the Prudential Regulation Committee.  0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0–50 50–60 60–70 70–80 80–90 90–100 100+ Mortgage LTV (per cent) IRB weighted average   ± 1 standard deviation(b) IRB weighted average(c) Per cent Chart A.18 Lenders allocate more capital to mortgages with higher LTV ratios Risk weights on UK ‘prime’ mortgages by LTV(a) Sources:  PRA regulatory returns and Bank calculations.

Box 3 PRA Supervisory Statement on underwriting standards for buy-to-let mortgages(1) In 2016 the PRA undertook a review of lenders’ underwriting standards in the buy-to-let market.(2) The review revealed that some lenders were applying standards that were somewhat weaker than those prevailing in the market as a whole.  A number of lenders and other firms planned to grow their gross buy-to-let lending significantly, so there was a risk that competitive conditions would lead more firms to relax underwriting standards to implement their plans. In response, the PRA Board issued a Supervisory Statement to clarify its expectations for underwriting standards in the buy-to-let market.  It set the baseline minimum stressed interest rate to be used in the affordability test at the higher of 5.5% or a 2 percentage point increase in buy-to-let mortgage interest rates. Although the stressed interest rate is lower than that applied to owner-occupier mortgages in the FPC’s Recommendation, lenders tend to test affordability using ICR thresholds of at least 125% (and, more recently, industry standards have been moving to 145% due to tax changes).  So, effectively, these affordability assessments require borrowers’ expected monthly rental income from the buy-to-let property to include at least a 25% buffer over the monthly mortgage interest payment estimated using the stressed interest rate above.  In addition, LTV ratios at origination in excess of 75% are much less common in buy-to-let than in owner-occupier mortgages;  in 2016, they accounted for around 10% and 45% of new mortgages respectively.  Buy-to-let loans therefore typically start with a larger equity cushion, providing greater resilience to credit risk for lenders. The FPC considers that no action beyond the PRA Supervisory Statement is warranted at this stage for macroprudential purposes.  The growth of buy-to-let mortgage lending slowed significantly in April 2016 and has been weak since, due to the combination of changes to stamp duty land tax, changes to mortgage interest tax relief and the implementation of the PRA Supervisory Statement.  The FPC will continue to monitor developments in the buy-to-let market and any potential threats to financial stability.

High LTV lending primarily poses risks to lenders.  Resilience of lenders to these risks is afforded by the Bank’s stress-testing framework, the broader capital regime and the FPC’s existing Recommendations. The Committee is also mindful that the LTI flow limit can effectively constrain the proportion of high LTV lending in some instances.  An individual borrower’s LTI and LTV are mechanically linked through the house price to income ratio:          Mortgage loan    =    Mortgage loan    X   Value of house               Income                Value of house               Income So for a given house price to income ratio, the greater a borrower’s LTI, the greater their LTV.   Due to substantial variation in the ratio of house prices to incomes across different regions of the country, the LTI flow limit will not constrain high LTV lending in all circumstances. For example, in the South East, where house prices are higher relative to incomes, borrowers tend to have higher LTI ratios. Limits on high LTI lending effectively constrain high LTV lending too.  In other regions, where house prices are lower relative to incomes, underwriting standards on LTI ratios are less constraining.  This is illustrated in Chart A, which shows that more mortgagors in London and the South East have higher LTI ratios.  The FPC will keep under review the risks to lenders stemming from high LTV mortgage lending.  It could in future consider employing LTV limits to insure against risks on owner-occupier or buy-to-let mortgages, as other macroprudential authorities have done in a number of countries.(1) However, the FPC judges that the combination of stress testing and bank capital requirements, alongside its existing Recommendations in the mortgage market, build a degree of lender resilience that is proportionate to current risks.   MCOB 11.6.18(2).  This Recommendation applies to all lenders which extend residential mortgage lending in excess of £100 million per annum. The FPC will continue to review the calibration of both the affordability test and the LTI flow limit regularly. While the current policy package is likely to remain in place for the foreseeable future, the FPC will continue to review the calibration of the affordability test and LTI flow limit on a regular basis.(1) The following principles will guide its approach to considering the calibration of the policies in the future. The FPC will review the calibration of the two Recommendations together. The affordability test and the LTI flow limit complement one another.  For a given mortgage term and stressed mortgage rate, the two provide a broadly equivalent constraint on the amount of borrowing prospective mortgagors could take on relative to their incomes (Chart A.14).  As Bank Rate rises in the future, the affordability test could become more constraining on lending relative to the LTI flow limit.  The Committee therefore intends to consider the balance between the two policies if and when Bank Rate rises to a level close to 1%. The calibration of the policies will depend on the FPC’s judgement around risks to both interest rates and incomes. Increases in Bank Rate lead to higher mortgage rates and, so, higher mortgage payments.  Higher unemployment raises the (1) For international evidence on the impact of macroprudential measures in the housing market, see Box 1 in Bank of England (2016), ‘The Financial Policy Committee’s powers over housing policy instruments’, A draft Policy Statement; www.bankofengland.co.uk/ﬁnancialstability/Documents/fpc/draftpolicystatement181 116.pdf.

(1) The FPC has a duty to review its Recommendations at regular intervals and consider whether they should remain in place or be withdrawn.                                                                                                                                                                 Part A The FPC’s approach to addressing risks from the UK mortgage market     13 probability that borrowers suffer a reduction to their income, reducing the available resources to meet mortgage costs. Both types of shock increase mortgagors’ DSRs, other things equal, and high DSRs have historically been associated with increases in arrears rates and falls in consumption.  The FPC will draw upon a range of indicators to inform its judgements around risks to interest rates and incomes. These include, but are not limited to:  the distance between variables’ current values and their estimated equilibrium values;  and historical and international evidence on the scale of potential shocks.  When assessing potential future changes to interest rates, the Committee is more likely to be guided by slow-moving, ‘structural’ measures of interest rates than by market expectations of future interest rates. Given the long-term nature of mortgage contracts, it judges that it would be imprudent to rely too heavily on potentially volatile market-implied measures.  The FPC will consider the overall volume of mortgage lending in calibrating the LTI flow limit. The LTI flow limit is expressed as a share of new mortgage lending.  If the total volume of mortgage lending were to increase materially, the FPC could consider recalibrating the LTI flow limit to ensure that the overall number of highly indebted households does not become excessively high. Box 5 The affordability test Recommendation The new Recommendation states that lenders should test affordability by considering a 3 percentage point increase in their current reversion rate (for many lenders this is the standard variable rate, or ‘SVR’), while the previous Recommendation stated that lenders should consider a 3 percentage point increase in Bank Rate.   So far, lenders have been using a range of approaches to calculate the stressed interest rate at which they test affordability — so there has been a lack of consistency across the market.  Because the previous Recommendation was expressed as a 3 percentage point change in Bank Rate, it was open to different interpretations by lenders.  For example, lenders could make different assumptions about whether the appropriate rate to use was the one at origination or the reversion rate.  Indeed, there has been significant variation across lenders on the stressed mortgage rate used to assess affordability compared to their current SVRs.  Around half of the mortgages extended in 2016 Q4 were tested using a stressed interest rate of SVR plus 2.75–3.25 percentage points. About 30% of mortgages were tested at a lower rate, and about 20% at a higher rate. Lending conditions in the mortgage market are becoming easier and competitive pressures in the market remain.  So there is a risk that lenders loosen the standard at which they test affordability, especially if there is significant scope for interpretation of the policy. The new Recommendation promotes consistency of implementation across lenders and insures against the risk of loosening underwriting standards.  It also ensures that borrower affordability is tested in the event that the borrower is unable to refinance their mortgage at the end of the fixed-rate period, which is appropriate given that — in times of stress — some borrowers may be unable to do. Although the new Recommendation will require some lenders to increase the stressed interest rate at which they test affordability, the aggregate impact on current mortgage lending is expected to be small.  The amendment reinforces the insurance role of the FPC’s measures.   • In 2016 Q4, the average stressed rate (weighted by the volume of new lending) was just over 6.8%.  Bank staff estimate that with the new Recommendation it would have been just over 7%.(1) • Bank staff’s central estimate is that, had the new Recommendation been in place in 2016, it would have reduced mortgage approvals by less than 0.5% relative to the previous Recommendation, with a slightly larger impact on smaller lenders than on the major lenders.   • The aggregate impact on actual lending is estimated to be small because, even if a lender increases its stressed interest rate, borrowers whose mortgage payments (calculated at the stressed rate) are low relative to their incomes will still pass the test. Consistent with the LTI flow limit, the new affordability test Recommendation includes a ‘de minimis’ threshold (set at £100 million of mortgage lending per annum) that exempts some lenders, to ensure proportionality.(2) (1) The 2016 Q4 quarter has been chosen rather than the whole of 2016 to avoid comparability issues due to the Bank Rate cut in August 2016. (2) The FPC will monitor lending done by ﬁrms below this threshold.  14                                                                                                                                                           Financial Stability Report  June 2017 UK consumer credit Consumer credit has been growing rapidly in recent years… Lending to individuals in the form of consumer credit grew by 10.3% in the twelve months to April 2017.  Though a little slower than in 2016 Q4, this was close to its fastest annual growth rate since 2005. Consumer credit has been growing much faster than household incomes in recent years (Chart A.19).  During that period, dealership car finance has seen the fastest expansion, though other forms of consumer credit (mainly credit cards and personal loans) accounted for more than half of consumer credit growth in the past year.  Around half of net consumer credit lending in the twelve months to April 2017 was from banks, with major UK banks and smaller banks making broadly equal aggregate contributions to the annual growth rate. Lenders expect to continue to grow their portfolios through 2017, at the same time as real household income growth is expected to remain particularly weak.  For an overview of the consumer credit market, see Box 6. …reflecting a shift in the supply of credit… Strong consumer credit growth in recent years partly reflects structural changes in the provision of consumer finance, including a shift towards the use of dealership car finance. Technological changes, such as online shopping and contactless cards, have also encouraged greater credit card use for transactional purposes, with transactional credit card balances growing at broadly the same rate as overall credit card balances between 2012 and 2016. UK consumer credit has been growing rapidly.  Loss rates on consumer credit lending are low at present.  Partly as a result, banks’ net interest margins on new lending have fallen and major lenders are using lower risk weights to calculate the capital they need to hold.  Other things equal, these developments mean lenders have less capacity to absorb losses.  In this context, a review by the PRA has found evidence of weaknesses in some aspects of underwriting and a reduction in resilience. The FPC supports the intentions of the PRA and FCA to publish, in July, their expectations of lenders in the consumer credit market.  Firms remain the first line of defence.  Effective governance at firms should ensure that risks are priced and managed appropriately and benign conditions do not lead to complacency by lenders.  The Bank’s annual stress test assesses banks’ resilience to risks in consumer credit.  Given the rapid growth in consumer credit over the past twelve months, the FPC is bringing forward the assessment of stressed losses on consumer credit lending in the Bank’s 2017 annual stress test.  This will inform the FPC’s assessment at its next meeting of any additional resilience required in aggregate against this lending. 5 0 5 10 15 20 25 2013 14 15 16 17 Percentage points Total consumer credit(b) Credit card(b) Dealership car ﬁnance(a) Other (non-credit card and non-dealership car ﬁnance)(b)(d) Nominal household income growth(c) + – Chart A.19 Consumer credit has been growing much faster than household incomes Annual growth rates of consumer credit products and household income Sources:  Bank of England, ONS and Bank calculations.

This partly reflects intense competition among lenders, as reported by market contacts, including those of the Bank’s Agents, and by major lenders in the Credit Conditions Survey. Interest rates on new personal loans have fallen since 2013 (Chart A.20), squeezing interest margins.  Credit card lenders have been offering longer interest-free periods.  The average interest-free period offered to new credit card customers on balance transfer offers has doubled since 2011 (Chart A.21). …and relatively benign economic conditions recently. The fall in pricing may also reflect lenders incorporating a relatively benign macroeconomic environment in their assessment of risk.  Loss rates on consumer credit lending are low at present, with arrears rates on UK banks’ consumer credit books in 2016 materially lower than their post-crisis average.  If lenders place undue weight when assessing risk on the recent performance of loans, this could mask a build-up of vulnerabilities in the consumer credit market. These developments leave lenders more vulnerable to losses in a stress… All else equal, falling interest margins mean that less interest income is available for lenders to absorb losses on consumer credit lending.  Average risk weights for consumer credit have also fallen in recent years, reducing the loss-absorbing capital required to fund these exposures (Chart A.22).(1) Falling margins do not appear to have been accompanied by a corresponding improvement in the underlying credit quality of new lending.  For example, qualitative responses to the Bank’s Credit Conditions Survey indicate that lenders have been loosening their credit scoring criteria for non-credit card unsecured lending since 2013.  All else equal, this makes it easier for households with lower credit scores to access consumer credit. Joint Bank/FCA analysis of data from credit reference agencies further shows a slight deterioration in credit scores on new consumer credit lending between 2015 and 2017.  This deterioration has occurred despite the fact that credit scores — which are used as an input to underwriting decisions by a number of lenders — can display elements of procyclicality.  In a benign macroeconomic environment, more borrowers can access credit and are able to make regular payments, leading to an improvement in credit scores, all else equal. The effects of any loosening in underwriting standards could be exacerbated by the rapid turnover of lenders’ consumer credit portfolios.

The credit quality of the stock of lending can therefore deteriorate quickly. …and could pose a risk to lenders’ resilience. Consumer credit accounts for less than 10% of major UK banks’ stock of lending to UK real-economy borrowers, compared with around 70% for mortgage lending.  But losses on consumer credit are far higher than for mortgages.  That is because, in the face of adverse shocks, borrowers are much more likely to default on their consumer credit loans than their mortgages.  And as the majority of consumer credit lending is unsecured, lenders cannot rely on the value of collateral to cushion their losses.  Over the past ten years, UK banks’ total write-offs on UK consumer credit lending have been ten times higher than on mortgages (Chart A.24). Losses on consumer credit lending are highly correlated with changes in unemployment (Chart A.25).  In the 2016 stress test, which included a 4.5 percentage point increase in the UK unemployment rate, stressed impairments on UK consumer credit exposures totalled around £18.5 billion. This compared with £11.8 billion of impairments for UK mortgages.  Aggregate cumulative impairments on consumer credit were 19% of total exposures in the five years of the stress scenario, compared with 1% for mortgages. In this context, vigilance is warranted. The PRA has undertaken a targeted review into the credit quality of consumer credit lending, and the FCA has been undertaking a review of its rules and guidance on creditworthiness assessments used in the consumer credit market.  The PRA review has found evidence of weaknesses in some aspects of underwriting and a reduction in resilience. The FPC supports the intentions of the PRA and FCA to publish, in July, their expectations of lenders in the consumer credit market.  Firms remain the first line of defence.  Effective governance at firms should ensure that risks are priced and managed appropriately and benign conditions do not lead to complacency by lenders. The Bank’s annual stress-test exercise assesses banks’ resilience to risks in consumer credit.  Given the rapid growth in consumer credit over the past twelve months, the FPC is bringing forward the assessment of stressed losses on consumer credit lending in the Bank’s 2017 annual stress test.  This will inform the FPC’s assessment at its next meeting of any additional resilience required in aggregate against this lending. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Credit card Other consumer credit 2014 2015 2016 Per cent Chart A.22 Average consumer credit risk weights have fallen since 2014 Major UK banks’ average risk weights on consumer credit exposures(a) Source:  Bank of England.

By comparison, the total amount of outstanding mortgage debt is around seven times larger at £1.3 trillion. Consumer credit accounts for less than 10% of UK banks’ stock of lending to UK real-economy borrowers, compared with around 70% for mortgage lending.  But it accounts for a much higher proportion of losses:  since 2007, UK banks’ total write-offs on UK consumer credit have been ten times higher than on mortgages. The consumer credit market can be divided into three broad categories: • Credit cards (34% of the stock of consumer credit). • Dealership car finance (30% of the stock). • ‘Other’ (36% of the stock), which is mainly made up of personal loans.  This category also includes overdrafts, peer-to-peer lending, store credit, and lending from credit unions and small non-bank money lenders such as pawnbrokers and payday lenders.(1) The consumer credit market is highly diverse, with a wide range of products and lenders.  But there are some common features across product types: • Short terms:  most consumer credit lending is at maturities of five years or less (apart from revolving facilities such as credit cards or overdrafts). • Higher interest rates:  while interest rates vary considerably across product types, they are typically materially higher than for mortgages.  This reflects a lack of collateral for most consumer credit products, and is intended to compensate the lender for the higher risk of losses. • Fixed rates:  most consumer credit products have interest rates that are fixed for the entire term of the loan. Banks provide around 80% of lending in the credit card and ‘other’ categories, but less than half of dealership car finance (Chart A). Credit cards There are two main ways of using credit cards:  ‘transactional’ and ‘revolving’.  Transactional credit card users repay their full balances at the end of the month, and so incur no interest payments.  Users with revolving balances roll over some of their debt from month to month, typically paying a relatively high interest rate (around 20%) on this borrowing. Some revolving credit card balances incur no interest.  Under a typical ‘balance transfer’ offer, borrowers move existing debt onto a new card, in some cases paying an upfront fee.  For a set period they then pay 0% interest on this balance, while paying down a proportion of the outstanding balance (typically a minimum of 1% per month, plus nominal fees).  At the end of the 0% offer period, interest is charged on any outstanding debt at a standard rate.  Other interest-free offers allow customers to accrue new debt at 0% interest for a period on new purchases or money transfers. The major UK banks have around £42 billion of outstanding credit card lending — around 19% of their common equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. Other consumer credit The bulk of this category is made up of unsecured personal loans, which typically have a three to five-year maturity at a fixed interest rate.  Just over a quarter of personal loans are taken out for the purposes of debt consolidation, with most of the remainder funding large purchases such as home improvements. The major UK banks have around £41 billion of ‘other’ consumer credit lending — around 19% of their CET1. Dealership car finance ‘Dealership car finance’ refers to loans offered to car buyers at the point of sale.  Traditionally, this takes the form of a hire purchase agreement.  Under a standard hire purchase, the customer pays a fraction of the car’s purchase price as a deposit, and takes out a loan to cover the rest, which is paid off with interest in regular monthly instalments, amortising fully.

At the end of the loan period customers have the option to make a pre-agreed ‘balloon payment’ or return the vehicle to the dealer.  The size of this balloon payment is set when the loan is issued, based on the estimated value of the vehicle in the used car market at the end of the loan period. Dealership car finance has been growing rapidly in recent years, with an average annual growth rate of around 20% since 2012.  The total stock of dealership car finance increased by more than £30 billion over that period, representing three quarters of total growth in the stock of consumer credit. This growth partly reflects a recovery in the car market:  total new car registrations in 2016 were 30% higher than in 2012. It also reflects a structural shift in how cars are purchased. Around 85% of new car purchases used dealership car finance in 2016, compared with about half in 2009.  In particular, use of PCP agreements has grown rapidly (Chart B). A significant share of dealership car finance is provided by subsidiaries of global car manufacturers.  Around half of the debt funding for these subsidiaries comes from their parent companies, around a quarter from securitisation, with the remainder from bank lending. Bank staff estimate major UK banks’ total exposures to UK car finance to be around £20 billion, or 9% of CET1, comprising: • Direct exposures — around £17 billion, or 8% of CET1.  This largely represents lending by banks’ asset finance subsidiaries, which make loans to car buyers, arranged through dealerships. • Indirect exposures via lending to UK finance subsidiaries of car manufacturers — around £2 billion, less than 1% of CET1.(1) • Indirect exposures via holdings of asset-backed securities in banks’ liquid asset buffers — around £1 billion, less than 0.5% of CET1. Arrears rates on dealership car finance tend to be lower than for other forms of consumer credit.  Unlike most other consumer credit, this lending is secured, with the vehicle acting as collateral.  But the value of this collateral declines over time, and is dependent on conditions in the used car market. Exposures to PCP lending may be particularly sensitive to market conditions:  if the borrower chooses to return the car at the end of the loan, and the value of the used car is less than the outstanding loan amount, the lender will make a loss. Lenders can seek to mitigate these risks by making conservative assumptions about the future value of used cars, though these assumptions are inherently uncertain. In a hypothetical scenario where car values at the end of contracts turn out to be 20% lower than expected by lenders at origination — and all PCP borrowers returned their vehicles — Bank staff estimate that market-wide PCP losses could be 3%–6% of the total outstanding stock of car finance.  Other things equal, if these loss rates were experienced on the major UK banks’ dealership car finance portfolios, it would imply a reduction of 2–7 basis points in major UK banks’ aggregate CET1 ratio.(2) That is, from a starting point of 13.92%, the ratio would fall to 13.85%–13.90%.  Market-wide losses would rise to 7%–10% of the outstanding stock in a more severe scenario where car values at the end of contracts turn out to be 30% lower than originally expected.  If these loss rates were applied to major UK banks’ portfolios, they would imply a reduction of 7–11 basis points in their aggregate CET1 ratio. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 2008 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Personal contract purchase(a) (left-hand scale) Other dealership car ﬁnance lending (left-hand scale) Proportion of new car sales funded with dealership car ﬁnance(b)   (right-hand scale) £ billions Per cent Chart B Value of annual dealership car finance for new car purchases, and proportion of private new car purchases funded with dealership car finance Sources:  Finance & Leasing Association, Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) and Bank calculations.

In April, for the first time since 2011, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised up its forecast for world GDP growth in 2017, to 3.5% from 3.4% (Chart A.26).  In May, the Monetary Policy Committee’s projection for average annual global GDP growth, weighted by countries’ share in UK exports, was 2½% in 2017–19.  This is up from 2¼% in November, partly due to stronger growth prospects in the euro area. The US Federal Open Market Committee raised its policy rate by 25 basis points in December, March and again in June. These increases were in line with market expectations and yields on US ten-year Treasury bonds have fallen by close to 20 basis points since the November Report,(1) offsetting around a third of the rise in US bond yields that followed immediately after the US election.  These developments have helped to ease external financing pressures on emerging market economies (EMEs), though vulnerabilities from high levels of debt remain. …though geopolitical and policy uncertainties remain high. While uncertainty about the outlook for US fiscal policy remains, some other aspects of the new US administration’s economic policy have become clearer.  In particular, the agreement between the United States and China to liberalise bilateral trade in certain food products and financial services, and signs that the United States will seek to renegotiate, rather than withdraw from, the North American Free Trade Agreement have eased some immediate concerns about the future of the global trading system.  Nevertheless, political and policy uncertainties, in particular about the prospects for a longer-term shift towards protectionism or for a weakening in global co-operation in financial regulation, remain high. As home to the leading international financial centre, the resilience of the UK financial system depends in part on Near-term growth prospects for the global economy have improved slightly and some possible risks have not crystallised.  But financial vulnerabilities in China remain pronounced as, although capital outflows have stabilised, economic growth continues to be accompanied by rapid credit expansion. In the euro area, bank equity prices have risen, reflecting expectations of stronger economic growth and further progress in strengthening banks’ capital positions.

Absent consistent implementation of standards internationally and appropriate supervisory co-operation, the FPC will need to assess how best to protect the resilience of the UK financial system. In China, foreign reserves have stabilised and capital outflows have fallen… Pressure from persistent capital outflows from China has eased.  The Institute of International Finance (IIF) estimates that the net outflow of capital from China was around US$42 billion in the first four months of 2017, down from around US$250 billion in the previous four months.  China’s official foreign exchange reserves were broadly stable in the first five months of 2017.  This stabilisation appears to reflect a combination of tighter controls on capital movements by the Chinese authorities, higher policy rates in China and a weakening in expectations of an appreciation in the US dollar. …but credit has continued to grow rapidly. However, underlying vulnerabilities remain pronounced.  Total social financing, a broad measure of domestic private sector credit, rose by 15.4% in the year to May 2017;(1) total non-financial sector debt was estimated to be just under 260% of GDP (Chart A.27).  In addition to raising policy rates, the Chinese authorities have tightened bank regulation in order to reduce leverage in the financial sector.  This will push up market rates further, making it more difficult for borrowers to service their debts.  The authorities have also set a target for economic growth of ‘around 6.5% or higher’ in 2017, and continued credit growth is expected to be an important tool for achieving this, making their task of reducing medium-term risks to financial stability more challenging.  If these risks were to crystallise, economic growth in China would slow sharply, leading to a sharp fall in Chinese imports and weaker growth in its trading partners.  This could have a larger effect globally than previously, given that China is becoming a more important trading partner for many economies (Chart A.28). UK banks’ exposures to China and the closely linked economy of Hong Kong are large (around US$535 billion, 183% of common equity Tier 1 capital, Chart A.29). Other EMEs have seen a resumption of portfolio inflows. After a brief period of outflows in late 2016, there have been substantial inflows of non-resident portfolio capital to other EMEs.  Credit-GDP gaps and current account deficits in many EMEs have also continued to narrow.  However, external debt, often taken out by the private sector and denominated in US dollars, remains high in many individual EMEs.  This may leave some countries like Turkey with weaker credit ratings and high borrowing needs (the IMF projects that maturing external debt in Turkey will be nearly 20% of GDP each year in 2017–19) exposed to a shift in risk appetite away from EMEs, a 0 10 20 30 40 50 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 2006 08 10 12 14 16 Non-ﬁnancial sector(a) (right-hand scale) Adjusted total social ﬁnancing(b) (left-hand scale) Headline total social ﬁnancing(c) (left-hand scale) Percentage changes on a year earlier Per cent of GDP Chart A.27 Credit continues to grow rapidly in China China non-financial sector debt and growth of total social financing Sources:  BIS total credit statistics, CEIC and Bank calculations.

UK banks’ exposures to non-China EMEs have fallen in recent years and broadly matched those to China and Hong Kong in 2017 Q1 (Chart A.29). Pressures on the European banking system have eased but concerns about profitability remain. Bank equity prices in continental Europe have continued to recover since the November Report.  The improved economic outlook is expected to increase the demand for credit and also to lead to lower provisions for non-performing loans;  both will tend to raise bank earnings.  In addition, successful capital-raising exercises by three major European banks, progress towards recapitalising some smaller Italian banks and the orderly resolution of a domestically significant Spanish bank, have eased some immediate concerns about the resilience of the banking sector. Euro-area banks’ common equity Tier 1 capital ratios are significantly higher than before the crisis.  However, non-performing loans remain at high levels in several European countries (Chart A.30) and concerns about the longer-term viability of some European banks’ business models remain.  In particular, the profitability of some European banks appears to be lower than the cost of raising new capital, which could make it difficult for them to rebuild their capital positions if they were to be hit by adverse shocks. Sovereign bond spreads in the euro area have fallen but government debt is still high in several economies. Sovereign bond spreads in several euro-area Member States rose in early 2017, reflecting heightened uncertainty ahead of elections in a range of countries.  They have since fallen back as the parliamentary election in the Netherlands (March 2017) and the presidential election in France (May 2017) passed without major shocks to markets.  However, government debt is still high in several euro-area economies.  Italy, where government debt was 133% of GDP in 2016, remains a particular concern.  Risks from the euro area may also emerge as a consequence of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (see Box 2). The FPC continues to assess UK banks’ ongoing resilience to the risks stemming from China and the euro area in its annual stress test.  The 2017 stress test includes an extremely severe scenario for China in which Chinese growth slows from just under 7% at the end of 2016 to -1.2% by the end of 2017, reflecting the scale of risks created by rapid credit expansion. 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 2005 07 09 11 13 15 17 Non-China emerging markets China and Hong Kong US$ billions Chart A.29 UK banks’ claims on non-China EMEs have fallen back to broadly match those on China and Hong Kong UK-owned banking groups’ consolidated exposures to selected countries and regions Sources:  Bank of England and Bank calculations. 0 5 10 15 20 Core excluding Germany(c) Periphery excluding Italy(b) Scandinavia(a) Germany Italy United Kingdom Per cent Chart A.30 Non-performing loan ratios are still high for banks in some European countries Ratio of non-performing loans and advances to total loans and advances (2016 Q4) Sources:  European Banking Authority and Bank calculations.

While reflecting, in part, monetary policy actions over most of the past decade, these low interest rates — which are adjusted for compensation for inflation — also appear to be consistent with pessimistic growth expectations (despite recent improvements to the near-term outlook), and high perceived tail risks.  Those perceptions may in part be associated with a high degree of geopolitical uncertainty (see Global environment chapter).  If severe, but plausible, downside risks were to materialise, they could lead to a sharp reduction in growth, increasing the attractiveness of longer-term government bonds relative to more risky assets, such as equities and corporate bonds.(1) …but measures of uncertainty implied by options prices are low… Market-based measures of perceived risks in the near term — or implied volatilities — have been low by historical standards across a number of markets (Chart A.32).  These measures are derived from the options used to insure against asset price moves.  The current low level of these measures may suggest that there is a relatively low expectation that geopolitical risks will actually materialise, at least over short horizons.  In June, the VIX measure of implied equity volatility, derived from S&P 500 stock index option prices, reached its lowest level since 1993. Long-term risk-free interest rates are at levels consistent with pessimistic growth expectations and high perceived tail risks.  In contrast, measures of uncertainty implied by options prices are low. Some asset valuations, particularly for some corporate bonds and UK commercial real estate, appear to factor in a low level of long-term market interest rates but do not appear consistent with the pessimistic and uncertain outlook embodied in these rates.  These asset prices are therefore vulnerable to a repricing, whether through an increase in long-term interest rates or adjustment of growth expectations, or both.  A sudden fall in asset prices could be amplified given reduced liquidity in some markets, particularly if some types of investors increase sales in response to price falls.  The resilience of the UK banking system to these repricing risks is being assessed through the 2017 stress test.

Increased use by investors of strategies that sell insurance against a rise in volatility, for which they get paid a premium, may have further contributed to the most recent reduction in measures of volatility. The low volatility environment could incentivise behaviour that leads to risk-taking and higher leverage, which would build up risks and fragilities in the financial system. …and some asset valuations appear inconsistent with the pessimistic and uncertain outlook embodied in long-term market interest rates.  In corporate bond markets, returns appear low relative to the risk borne by investors, offering little compensation for downside risks.  For example, corporate bond spreads are compressed, most notably in the riskier high-yield sector (Chart A.33).  In the United States, this compression in spreads has been accompanied by elevated levels of corporate leverage.  Non-price terms for corporate borrowing have also eased:  in both Europe and the United States, the share of leveraged lending deals with weaker covenants — where investors accept fewer safeguards in the event of a deterioration in the debtor company’s finances — has increased to over 70% in the first five months of 2017, from less than 5% in 2010. In the United Kingdom, real interest rates have fallen further, which does not appear to be reflected in some risky asset prices… In the United Kingdom, long-term risk-free real interest rates have fallen by 26 basis points since the previous Report, compared with a smaller fall in euro-area rates, and broadly unchanged US real rates (Chart A.34).  These developments suggest investors may be factoring in a higher probability of an adverse outcome for the UK economy.  That probability of an adverse outcome does not, however, appear to be reflected in some risky asset prices.  Spreads on sterling investment-grade corporate bonds, for example, are compressed relative to historical averages and high-yield spreads are close to post-crisis lows.  …including in the UK commercial real estate market… Valuations in some segments of the UK commercial real estate (CRE) sector also continue to appear stretched.  Aggregate prices rose by 0.9% on the quarter in 2017 Q1, leaving them broadly flat on a year earlier, despite a sharp fall in the quarter following the UK referendum on EU membership.

A range of sustainable valuations in the CRE market can be generated using a valuation model based on a number of assumptions, including about CRE rental yields. Based on this approach, current prices lie at the top end of the range of sustainable valuations (the blue range in Chart A.35), which is consistent with persistently low rental yields.  Were rental yields to return to their historical averages, this would suggest that current prices are above estimated sustainable valuation levels (the lower bound of the blue range in Chart A.35).  This would be consistent with either an increase in long-term risk-free interest rates or an adjustment of risk premia and medium-term rental growth expectations, or both. Some segments of the CRE market appear more stretched than the aggregate picture.  For example, current London West End office prices are well above the range of estimated sustainable valuation levels (the orange range in Chart A.35). Consensus forecasts from the Investment Property Forum, published in March, point to average price falls of around 0.7% for aggregate UK CRE and 6.0% for London West End offices by end-2018. An adjustment in asset prices could be amplified by the behaviour of some investors, which would affect the supply of credit to the real economy. Any adjustment in asset prices could be amplified, given reduced liquidity in some markets, particularly if some investors behave procyclically — that is, if they sell risky assets in large quantities purely in response to a reduction in the performance of their portfolios.  A range of assets, including UK CRE, are held in open-ended investment funds, some of which allow investors to redeem their investments on a daily basis.  The structure of these funds could create incentives for investors to redeem ahead of others, for example if investors remaining in a fund were to bear some of the costs of meeting redemptions.(1) This could test market liquidity (see Market-based finance chapter). In corporate bond markets, the amount held by open-ended investment funds has increased substantially in recent years, outpacing growth in the global market.  Firms have also been issuing longer-term bonds.  While this locks in financing for a longer period of time, it can mean that bondholders are exposed to larger movements in prices in the event of a sharp rise in interest rates.

(a)  Sustainable valuations are estimated using an investment valuation approach and are based on an assumption that property is held for five years.  The sustainable value of a property is the sum of discounted rental and sale proceeds.  The rental proceeds are discounted using a 5-year gilt yield plus a risk premium, and the sale proceeds are discounted using a 20-year, 5-year forward gilt yield plus a risk premium.  Expected rental value at the time of sale is based on Investment Property Forum Consensus forecasts.  The range of sustainable valuations represents varying assumptions about the rental yield at the time of sale:  either rental yields remain at their current levels (at the upper end), or rental yields revert to their 15-year historical average (at the lower end).

Together, these factors mean that the losses that would be incurred given a 100 basis point rise in interest rates in global corporate bond markets, all else equal, have increased markedly over the past few years (Chart A.36). Such higher losses could increase the likelihood of investors exhibiting procyclical behaviour and therefore magnifying price falls. In the limit, the supply of credit to the real economy, and transfer of risk to those who are best placed to manage it, could be impaired.  CRE is widely used as collateral for corporate borrowing.  An amplified downturn in the CRE market could be transmitted to the real economy by reducing companies’ access to bank loans and their ability to undertake new investment.  Research by Bank staff suggests that every 10% fall in UK CRE prices is associated with a 1% decline in economy-wide investment.(1) A sharp fall in asset prices could further adversely impact the balance sheets of banks and other financial institutions at the core of the financial system. UK banks have more than halved their stock of CRE lending since the crisis (Chart A.37).  The total stock of UK banks’ CRE lending fell from around £160 billion at end-2008 to around £77 billion at end-2016.  For large UK banks involved in the 2017 stress test,(2) their exposures to the CRE sector averaged around 50% of common equity Tier 1 capital at end-2016. And the 2016 stress test demonstrated that they have become more resilient to stresses in the CRE market. The Bank’s 2017 annual cyclical stress-test scenario will assess the resilience of the banking system to an increase in volatility, a reduction in market participants’ appetite for risk, and falls in asset prices, including a 40% fall in UK CRE prices.  The FPC continues to emphasise the importance of market participants recognising the distribution of risks in different asset classes, managing them prudently, and pricing them accordingly.

The aggregate Tier 1 capital position of major UK banks was 15.7% of risk-weighted assets in March 2017.  The FPC intends to set the minimum leverage requirement for major UK banks at 3.25% of non-reserve exposures, subject to consultation.  This is intended to offset the impact of removing central bank reserves from the leverage ratio exposure measure, and restore the original level of resilience delivered by the leverage ratio standard.  The United Kingdom is on course to ensure that, by 2022, any remaining barriers to the resolvability of the largest UK banks have been removed, and to implement ring-fencing requirements by 2019. Work is also ongoing to build resilience to cyber risks.   UK banks’ funding costs remain low, and equity prices have recovered over the past year.  However, price to book ratios remain low, reflecting continued headwinds from misconduct costs and low investment banking returns.  Weak profitability diminishes banks’ future ability to rebuild capital following a shock that incurs losses.  The exploratory scenario in the 2017 stress test will consider how the resilience of the UK banking system might evolve if recent headwinds to bank profitability persist and intensify. The UK banking system remains resilient. UK banks have continued to strengthen their capital positions. In aggregate, the major UK banks had a common equity  Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 13.9% of risk-weighted assets in  March 2017 (Chart B.1), and a total Tier 1 capital ratio of 15.7%.  This CET1 ratio is 40 basis points higher than at the time of the November 2016 Report, when the FPC judged that, as a consequence of the 2016 stress test, the UK banking system was, in aggregate, capitalised to support the real economy in a severe macroeconomic stress.  On a non  risk-weighted basis, the major UK banks’ aggregate leverage ratio was 5.3% of total exposures in March 2017, compared with total requirements and buffers of 3.3% (Chart B.2). UK banks’ liquidity and funding positions are also robust.  For major UK banks, the aggregate ratio of liquid assets to potential net outflows under stressed conditions (known as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio) was 128% in March 2017.  And all major UK banks have sufficient stable funding to meet the proposed Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) requirement.(1) Since 2014, the FPC has been contributing to the Bank’s annual review of the Sterling Monetary Framework (SMF), with members giving views on whether the SMF’s liquidity insurance facilities remained fit for purpose from a (1) The implementation date for the NSFR in the European Union is still to be confirmed. 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 2001 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Per cent Per cent Basel III common equity Tier 1     (CET1) weighted average(c)(d)    (right-hand scale) Basel II core Tier 1 weighted   average(a)(b)(c) (left-hand scale) CET1 ratio adjusted for 2016  stress-test losses(e) (right-hand scale) Basel III deﬁnition of capital  Chart B.1 Major UK banks have continued to strengthen their capital positions Major UK banks’ capital ratios Sources:  PRA regulatory returns, published accounts and Bank calculations.

As part of the Bank’s 2017 review, at its March meeting the FPC reviewed developments in the SMF over the previous year.  These included the additional indexed long-term repo operations that the Bank had announced prior to the EU referendum, and the increased number of SMF participants over the course of the year.  In the FPC’s view, and given developments in the SMF since the Bank’s 2016 review, the SMF remained fit for purpose from a macroprudential perspective.  The Bank’s 2017 annual review of the SMF will be published alongside the Bank’s forthcoming Annual Report.(1) Consistent with its previous commitment, the FPC is restoring the level of resilience delivered by its leverage ratio standard… In July 2016, the FPC excluded central bank reserves from the measure of banks’ exposures used to assess their leverage. This change reflected the special nature of central bank reserves and was designed to avoid a situation in which the Committee’s leverage standards impeded the transmission of monetary policy.  The FPC committed last year that it would make an offsetting adjustment to ensure that the amount of capital needed to meet the UK leverage ratio standard would not decline.  The FPC did not intend for there to be a permanent loosening of the standard.  At its June 2017 meeting, the FPC therefore agreed to consult on a draft Recommendation to the PRA that it amend its rules on the leverage ratio to: (i) exclude from the calculation of the total exposure measure those assets constituting claims on central banks, where they are matched by deposits accepted by the firm that are denominated in the same currency and of identical or longer maturity;  and (ii) require a minimum leverage ratio of 3.25%. By raising the minimum leverage standard from 3% to 3.25% on the revised exposure measure, the FPC intends to ensure that the original level of resilience is restored, while also preserving the benefits of excluding central bank reserves from the exposure measure.  The FPC and PRA consultations on these proposals will run from 27 June to 12 September 2017. The Committee will further consider the impact of changes to international standards on the calibration of the UK capital and leverage framework.  These changes include:  • the finalisation of Basel III;  and • the implementation of IFRS 9, due to come into effect in 2018. (1) A ‘Concordat’ between the FPC and the Bank’s Executive, describing the role of the FPC in relation to the SMF, was first published in 2013.  At its 2017 Q2 meeting, the FPC agreed a small number of updates to the Concordat, designed to clarify the FPC’s involvement in SMF decision-making.  The MPC SMF Concordat is being updated in parallel.  The updated concordats will replace the 2013 versions published on the Bank’s website. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Per cent Per cent 2001 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Weighted average    Basel III deﬁnition(b)(c)    (right-hand scale) Weighted average(a)(b)    (left-hand scale) Adjusted leverage ratio(d)    (right-hand scale) Basel III deﬁnition of capital  Chart B.2 Leverage ratios have strengthened Major UK banks’ leverage ratios Sources:  PRA regulatory returns, published accounts and Bank calculations.

Significant progress has been made to remove barriers to resolvability but there is still more to do.  The United Kingdom now has a comprehensive and effective bank resolution regime, under which the Bank has a wide toolkit, including the power to ‘bail in’ the shareholders and creditors of failed banks.  This requires banks to maintain a minimum amount of loss-absorbing resources known as ‘minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities’ (MREL).  In May 2017, the Bank published estimates of the amount of MREL that the largest UK banks and building societies will be required to maintain when requirements are implemented in full in 2022.(1) Based on these indicative estimates, the largest UK banks will be required by 2022 to have aggregate loss-absorbing resources of 28% of risk-weighted assets on average.(2) Around half of this will be in the form of Tier 1 capital that can absorb losses before resolution.  Large UK banks have issued around £70 billion of senior unsecured holding company debt over the past two years, which can readily be bailed in.  The Bank estimates that these banks will need to issue around an additional £150 billion of MREL-eligible instruments to meet the indicative 2022 requirements.(3) With a view to further increasing transparency about the resolvability of firms, the Bank intends to provide summaries of major UK banks’ resolution plans and its assessment of their effectiveness, including any further steps that need to be taken, by 2019.(4) …while firms are on track to implement their ring-fencing plans by 2019.  The largest UK banks are in the process of separating their core retail banking activities into ‘ring-fenced banks’ (RFBs), with investment and international banking activities situated outside the ring-fence.  Ring-fencing will deliver significant financial stability benefits, by protecting core retail banking activities from risks associated with activities such as investment banking, and by enhancing the resolvability of large banking groups.  (1) Refers to the four UK global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) — Barclays, HSBC, RBS and Standard Chartered — plus Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide and Santander UK. (2) This includes Basel III capital buffers, and assumes a 1% countercyclical capital buffer. (3) As a firm’s MREL will depend upon its going concern requirements in a particular year, the 2022 MRELs are simply indicative and are based on the calibration methodology set out in the Bank’s Statement of Policy, with reference to the firms’ minimum capital requirements and balance sheets as at December 2016.

Implementation of ring-fencing carries operational risks.   Firms will need to ensure customers are served, and products and services provided, from separate legal entities.  This will involve some major reorganisations and transfers, including moving a large number of customers to new sort codes over the next year.  Some IT systems will be separated and direct access will need to be established for RFBs to financial infrastructure, such as clearing and payment systems.  Firms have plans in place to mitigate the risk of disruption to essential financial services during this process, and the PRA is monitoring the implementation of ring-fencing closely.  Work is also ongoing to build cyber resilience.  Cyber attacks pose a serious threat to the resilience of the  UK financial system.  At its June 2017 meeting, the FPC reviewed progress by the UK authorities and financial sector  in building cyber resilience, and decided to withdraw its  June 2015 Recommendation on CBEST vulnerability testing. The FPC has also set out its approach to assessing cyber resilience in the future.  These assessments are set out in  Box 7. Market indicators support a view that UK banks are resilient… Reflecting the overall resilience of the UK banking sector, bank funding costs have remained low since the November Report (Table B.1).  Credit default swap (CDS) premia, which measure the cost of insuring against bank default, are now close to post-crisis lows, at just under 60 basis points.  And spreads on additional Tier 1 (AT1) instruments — bonds that convert to equity if a bank’s capital ratio falls below a certain level — are at their lowest level on record.  The market for European (including UK) banks’ AT1 instruments has made a strong recovery following turbulence in February 2016;  market contacts attribute this to an improving economic environment, a perceived fall in European political risks and changes in the regulatory treatment of AT1 in Europe.  …and the Bank's Term Funding Scheme has helped to  ensure lending rates have fallen in line with Bank Rate  since July 2016… In August 2016, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) cut Bank Rate to 0.25%, and launched a Term Funding Scheme (TFS) to provide funding for banks at interest rates close to Bank Rate.  The TFS was intended to reinforce the transmission of the cut in Bank Rate to the real economy.   In addition, the TFS provides participants with a cost-effective source of funding to support additional lending to the real economy, insuring against the risk that conditions tighten  in bank funding markets.

As of June 2017, aggregate outstanding TFS drawings by UK banks and building societies were £65 billion. As set out in the Bank’s 2017 Q1 Credit Conditions Review, most major UK lenders reported that the TFS had contributed to recent falls in bank funding spreads.  As a result, since the TFS was introduced, quoted rates on new real-economy lending have, overall, fallen broadly in line with the reduction in Bank Rate as intended (Chart B.3).  …but low profitability may pose a risk to resilience in future. UK banks’ equity prices have recovered from their mid-2016 lows (Chart B.4).  While aggregate return on equity for the largest UK banks was just below zero in 2016, ‘underlying’ returns, which strip out misconduct costs and one-time charges such as restructuring costs, remained positive, at around 6%.  2017 Q1 results showed material improvement in profits, driven by a partial recovery in investment banking returns (Chart B.5). Price to book ratios, which measure the market value of equity relative to the value of equity recorded on banks’ balance sheets, remain persistently below one (Chart B.6).  The FPC continues to judge that the low equity prices of UK banks can likely be explained by anticipated misconduct redress costs and weak expected operating profitability of investment banking services in particular, rather than by market concerns about asset quality.  For major global banks generally, the correlation between price to book ratios and expected returns on equity is currently above 90% (Chart B.7), and much higher than the correlation between price to book ratios and measures of asset quality.  This means that low price to book ratios for UK banks do not signify that their ability to absorb losses is diminished. Weak profitability does affect banks’ future ability to rebuild capital following any shock that results in losses while also maintaining credit supply.  The exploratory scenario in the 2017 stress test will consider how the resilience of the UK banking system might evolve if recent headwinds to bank profitability persist and intensify.  The purpose of this scenario is to explore the impact of banks’ actions on both the real economy and the future resilience of the system to shocks.

These incidents highlight the importance of firms developing capabilities to protect against, respond to and recover from cyber attacks.  Progress made towards building cyber resilience in the financial system Since 2013, the FPC has made two Recommendations to regulators regarding cyber resilience (Table 1).  This box describes how these Recommendations have been implemented, and sets out the FPC’s future approach.  Since the 2013 Recommendation, the organisation of authorities who have a role in strengthening the resilience of the financial system to cyber risks has been improved.  The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has been established as the main technical authority for UK cyber security in order to share knowledge and address systemic vulnerabilities.  UK financial authorities, together with the NCSC and the industry, have since improved information sharing across the financial sector.   A response framework allows the UK authorities to  co-ordinate their response to cyber attacks that have affected, or have the potential to affect, the financial sector.  It now includes the NCSC and, if appropriate, the National Crime Agency. At the international level, the G7 Cyber Expert Group has published guidance on cyber security for the financial sector.(1) The group is now developing guidance for effective cyber security assessment;  identifying and treating cyber risk arising from third parties;  and co-ordinating with other critical sectors such as telecommunications and energy.  The FPC’s Recommendations have catalysed testing of the resilience of core financial companies to cyber attack. The 2015 FPC Recommendation called for financial services firms and financial market infrastructures at the core of the  UK financial system (‘core firms’) to complete so-called CBEST tests.  These tests subject firms to simulated cyber attacks, and are tailored to each firm, drawing on government, intelligence agency and private sector expertise.  Since 2014, 31 out of 34 firms have finished testing, and two further firms are close to completion.  This includes banks representing more than 80% of the outstanding stock of PRA-regulated banks’ lending to the UK real economy.  The first round of CBEST testing is therefore materially complete.  The results of testing, together with the actions taken to address weaknesses, demonstrate that core firms have made significant progress in building cyber resilience. The first round of tests served its intended purpose by identifying weaknesses in core firms’ cyber resilience.  For obvious security reasons, these results will not be detailed. But where shortcomings were identified, firms are implementing action plans to remedy the issues, overseen by supervisors.  In some cases, controls on the integrity of systems and confidentiality of data needed to be strengthened.  In others, the tests identified the need for further investment in capabilities to detect, mitigate and respond to attacks.  And in general, the tests highlighted the importance of firms continuing to invest in their people, processes and technology in order to counter the risks of  cyber attack.   Consistent with the FPC’s Recommendation, CBEST will become a regular component of supervisory assessment of firms.  Core firms will be expected to conduct their own regular tests of cyber resilience.  They will also be subject to supervisor-led CBEST testing at regular intervals.  The frequency of these tests will be proportionate to firms’ importance for financial stability.  CBEST is also being adopted in other jurisdictions and sectors.   Based on the progress made, the FPC judges that its  2015 Recommendation has been implemented, and that  it is appropriate to withdraw its Recommendation. Table 1 The FPC’s Recommendations on cyber resilience In June 2013, the FPC recommended that: ‘HM Treasury, working with the relevant government agencies, the PRA, the Bank’s financial market infrastructure supervisors and the FCA should work with the core UK financial system and its infrastructure to put in place a programme of work to improve and test resilience to cyber attack.’ In July 2015, the June 2013 Recommendation was replaced with the following Recommendation: ‘The FPC recommends that the Bank, the PRA and the FCA work with firms at the core of the UK financial system to ensure that they complete CBEST tests and adopt individual cyber resilience action plans.  The Bank, the PRA and the FCA should also establish arrangements for CBEST tests to become one component of regular cyber resilience assessment within the UK financial system.’ Source:  Bank of England.

Part B Banking sector resilience                                                                                      33 The next phase in building and maintaining resilience Given the progress made and the lessons from work to date, the FPC is now moving to the next stage. Its focus is on systemic risk, rather than risk to individual companies or consumers.  That is, the risk of cyber attack causing disruption to critical financial services on a scale that causes material disruption to the UK economy.  The FPC is setting out the elements of the framework of regulation for the UK financial system’s cyber resilience that are necessary to mitigate systemic risk.  The FPC’s future role will be to check that each element is being fulfilled by the relevant authorities.   The FPC judges that effective regulation requires:  (1) Clear baseline expectations for firms’ resilience that reflect their importance for the financial system. Working with the Bank, PRA and FCA, the FPC will consider its tolerance for the disruption to important economic functions provided by the financial system.  Supervisors will set clear expectations for firms consistent with this tolerance.  (2) Regular testing of resilience by firms and supervisors.  This will build on the first round of CBEST testing and ensure the most systemic firms are subject to regular checks, with the frequency and scope of the tests set in line with supervisory strategy.  This will allow supervisors to keep pace with the evolving nature of the risk.   Assessment of the system’s resilience will also be informed by sector-wide simulation exercises, which test the industry’s response and recovery capabilities.  The FPC has asked for regular reports from supervisors on the systemic risks exposed by these regular tests and exercises.  (3) Identification of firms that are outside the financial regulatory perimeter, but which may be important for regulated firms.  Cyber attacks that result in disruption to third-party providers outside the regulatory scope could still have effects on the financial system.  The FPC has therefore requested annual updates from the financial authorities, which include HM Treasury, the Bank, PRA and FCA, on the cyber resilience of firms that are outside the regulatory perimeter, but which are important for the UK financial sector.  (4) Clear and tested arrangements to respond to cyber attacks when they occur. UK authorities co-ordinate their response to cyber attacks that may potentially affect the financial system.  The financial authorities regularly test and review these arrangements, in line with evolving threats and experience gained from managing incidents.  Co-operation with the industry can also enhance the sector’s capacity to respond to threats and share information during an incident.  The FPC has requested an annual update on the effectiveness of the response framework from financial authorities, to check that the system has the capacity to respond to and recover from a cyber attack. Where the FPC receives reports that demonstrate shortcomings in the regulatory framework, it will consider using its statutory powers to make Recommendations to the relevant authorities that these be remedied.  Market-based finance 34                                                                                                                                                          Financial Stability Report  June 2017 Market-based finance accounts for almost half of the UK financial system’s total assets, and supports the provision of financial services to the real economy.  The provision of market-based finance relies on core financial intermediaries, such as dealers, which remain resilient.  But there is evidence that conditions in some markets, such as the repo market, have declined in recent years, as dealers are less willing to act as intermediaries.  High demand for market liquidity in stresses, including from open-ended funds, also remains a risk.  Life insurance companies, meanwhile, continue to support market-based finance through increased holdings of illiquid assets. Market-based finance is an increasingly important source of financing for the UK real economy. The importance of market-based finance as a means of providing finance to the real economy has grown over the past few years.  Non-bank financial institutions represent key sources of market-based finance and account for almost half of the UK financial system’s total assets, up by 10 percentage points since 2009.  These institutions provide financial services to the real economy, including by investing in capital markets, such as equity and corporate bond markets (Chart B.8). On a cumulative basis, capital markets account for almost all net finance raised by UK private non-financial corporations (PNFCs) since the global financial crisis, primarily in the form of bond issuance.  In 2017 to date, sterling investment-grade issuance by UK companies has been broadly in line with its 2010–16 average. In April, the Bank completed its purchase of £10 billion of investment-grade corporate bonds under the Corporate Bond Purchase Scheme (CBPS), announced as part of the Monetary Policy Committee’s policy package in August 2016. Due to its importance for the UK real economy, the FPC has established a medium-term priority of completing post-crisis reforms to market-based finance in the United Kingdom, and improving the assessment of systemic risks across the financial system (see The FPC’s medium-term priorities chapter). The provision of market-based finance relies on core financial intermediaries, such as dealers, which remain resilient… Some financial markets, such as cash fixed-income markets, rely on dealers to intermediate between clients, including by building and releasing inventories as part of their market-making activity.  Measures of dealer resilience remain 15 10 5 0 5 10 15 20 2010 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Loans Market-based ﬁnance(b) Total(c) £ billions + – Chart B.8 Market-based finance is an important source of financing for UK companies Net finance raised by UK private non-financial corporations (PNFCs)(a) Sources:  Bank of England and Bank calculations.

The aggregate leverage ratio of the world’s largest dealers was 5.2% at end-December (Chart B.9).  Since the November 2016 Report, market perceptions of UK dealers’ credit risk, as measured by the cost of default protection (CDS premia), have decreased.  …while reforms to over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets are ongoing. Through OTC derivatives markets, dealers and other financial institutions are exposed to counterparty credit risk related to clients, one another and — for those markets that are cleared — central counterparties (CCPs).  In March 2017 new rules were introduced to implement international requirements for the margining of non-cleared OTC derivatives, which aim to improve the mitigation of counterparty credit risk in those transactions.  These rules are one element of the G20 reforms to derivatives markets agreed in 2009.  In November 2016, the FPC asked the Bank to conduct an in-depth assessment to examine progress towards the implementation of the post-crisis reforms in derivatives markets and the implications for the resilience of the financial system.  This assessment continues to feed into broader work by the Financial Stability Board (FSB). But there is evidence that conditions in some markets, such as the repo market, have declined over recent years, where dealers are less willing to act as intermediaries. Market liquidity refers to the ability of investors to buy and sell assets in reasonable size, and within a reasonable time frame, without having a large impact on prevailing prices. When market liquidity is reliable, it encourages participation in financial markets, by providing confidence both for issuers (who want to be able to borrow when required at competitive terms) and for investors (who want to be able to move smoothly in and out of positions).(1) The provision of market-based finance is more likely to be stable when financial markets are liquid and function smoothly.  The resilience of market liquidity remains uneven across markets. Repo markets contribute to effective market functioning by enabling market makers, such as dealers, to finance their inventories, and leveraged investors, such as hedge funds, to transact in securities, thus supporting market liquidity.  The July 2016 Report noted that there has been a decline in the availability of, and increase in the cost of, repo financing in some jurisdictions.  This is consistent with findings from a cross-jurisdiction study of developments in repo markets conducted by the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), published in April 2017.(2) (1) Fair and Effective Markets Review, Final Report, June 2015; www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2015/055.aspx.

In some cases, this has led to other financial institutions finding it difficult to place cash.  One example cited is that only four of the eleven counterparties that had offered repo facilities to a major European asset manager in 2014 were still willing to do so in 2016 (Chart B.10).  The CGFS report also provides evidence of increased costs faced by end-users borrowing in the repo market;  for example, repo rates (relative to expectations of policy interest rates) paid by pension funds to borrow cash in the UK gilt repo market increased around fourfold between 2014 and 2016 (Chart B.11).  At the same time, the report notes that the rate at which end-users place cash in repo has remained broadly constant since late 2014.    One indicator of reduced repo market liquidity is the volatility in repo rates that has started to occur around reporting dates as dealers reduce their repo activity (Chart B.12).  Dislocations in European government bond repo markets at end-2016 were particularly acute, with gilt repo rates falling to -0.5%, the lowest level reached in the past decade.  The fall in rates at the end of 2017 Q1 was more muted, which market contacts attribute in part to participants improving their preparations following the challenging year-end. The CGFS report identifies several drivers behind these changes in repo market conditions.  One driver has been changes in the economic environment, such as those driven by central banks.  Exceptional monetary policy measures reduce the demand for central bank reserves to meet daily liquidity needs while increasing the supply, including through asset purchases, of those reserves.  Changes in the regulatory environment have also played a role — particularly those that act on the size, as well as the composition, of banks’ balance sheets, such as the introduction of leverage ratio requirements.  In this context, the FPC will consider the impact of changes to international standards on the calibration of the UK capital and leverage framework (see Banking sector resilience chapter). High demand for market liquidity, including from open-ended funds invested in less liquid assets, remains a risk. The functioning of some markets could be tested by high demand for liquidity, including from open-ended investment funds.  These funds offer short-term redemptions to investors while investing in some cases in longer-dated and potentially illiquid assets.  Assets under management in such funds increased by 80% between 2008 and 2015. Large-scale redemptions could result in sales of assets by funds that exceed the ability of dealers and other investors to absorb them, potentially impairing market liquidity.  These effects could be amplified if resulting falls in prices lead to 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Jan. July Per cent 2014 15 16 17 Jan. July Jan. July Jan.

This potential imbalance between the demand for, and supply of, market liquidity could be particularly acute if investor redemptions were accompanied by volatility rising from its current low level, which could lead to a reduction in dealers’ market-making capacity.   Following the UK referendum on EU membership, funds invested in UK commercial real estate suffered significant redemptions and some suspensions, with implications for market liquidity (see the November 2016 Report).  The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) subsequently published a discussion paper in February 2017 covering all open-ended funds investing in illiquid assets.(1) The paper aims to gather evidence to decide whether changes to the FCA’s regulatory approach are needed to enhance market stability and promote competition in the sector, while protecting consumers. The FSB also finalised in January its policy recommendations to address related structural vulnerabilities from asset management activities.(2) The key recommendations are: (i) funds’ investment strategies should be consistent with their redemption terms;  (ii) authorities should give consideration to system-wide stress testing;  and (iii) globally consistent measures of leverage should be developed.  The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) is currently operationalising the FSB recommendations, and will consult on draft updated liquidity risk management principles. Life insurance companies, meanwhile, continue to support market-based finance through increased holdings of illiquid assets. Life insurance companies are important investors in financial assets and hence in supporting market-based finance.  In the United Kingdom, life insurers hold £1.8 trillion of investment and cash assets and account for a significant proportion of the total assets outstanding in several UK securities markets. Low market interest rates continue to provide an incentive for life insurers to invest in more illiquid assets such as lower-rated fixed-income securities and real-economy assets, such as equity release mortgages, commercial real estate and infrastructure, in order to earn higher returns.  For example, property-related non-linked exposures (ie exposures where insurance firms bear all or part of the market risk on asset holdings) increased from £93 billion in 2016 Q3 to £99 billion in 2016 Q4 (Chart B.13), to stand at 11% of total non-linked assets of UK insurance companies.

UK annuity writers are well-matched between their assets and liabilities versus their European counterparties, as evidenced in the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) 2016 stress test. Matching long-dated illiquid liabilities with suitable long-dated illiquid assets can help ensure availability of finance to the wider economy, but can also present risks where firms may not have adequate systems and controls to manage the risks associated with these assets.  The PRA issued a consultation on this topic in December 2016.(2) The FPC supports ongoing work by the Bank and other authorities to strengthen the regulatory framework for, and oversight of, non-bank financial institutions.  Following efforts by the G20 and the FSB to strengthen the oversight and regulation of the ‘shadow banking’ system, in April the European Parliament agreed reforms to money market funds, likely to come into force in 2018.  The reforms are aimed at making these funds more robust, in order to maintain the essential role that money market funds play in financing the real economy. The FCA has continued to review the regulatory framework for peer-to-peer platforms in light of the sector’s rapid growth and developments in firms’ business models.  In their interim feedback report on this work, the FCA raised a number of concerns including around information quality, inconsistent disclosures and insufficient wind-down procedures for some firms.  The FCA has further set out expectations of firms that operate loan-based crowdfunding platforms that provide loans to businesses.  The Bank has also contributed to a CGFS and FSB report on FinTech credit.(3) The report concludes that in future FinTech could improve financial stability by providing an alternative source of finance.  But it may also give rise to systemic concerns, for example by lowering lending standards, procyclical credit provision, and by posing challenges to the regulatory perimeter.  The FPC supports this work and will continue to monitor the sector.

Most electronic payments are made via ‘payment systems’ in which financial institutions participate to exchange money on behalf of their customers.  Each payment system maintains:  (a) a set of rules and procedures that govern the transfer of funds between these institutions;  and (b) an infrastructure to facilitate those transfers.  The largest and most critical payments in the United Kingdom are made over CHAPS, the country’s High-Value Payment System (HVPS). The scale, type and sophistication of potential threats to the stability of payment systems are rising.  Risks such as cyber attack are increasingly capable of striking at any part of the payments chain.  It is essential that payment systems are able to take an end-to-end view of these risks.  Having identified constraints in the existing structure, the Bank decided in April, with the FPC’s endorsement, to move to ‘direct delivery’ of the HVPS.  The Bank is now working closely with CHAPS Co, the current operator of the HVPS and with industry to ensure a smooth and timely transition to the new structure this calendar year. This box explains the rationale for the decision to move to direct delivery.  It then places it in the broader context of the Bank’s programme for renewal of its Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) infrastructure.  The Bank’s aim is for this programme to deliver a materially stronger, more resilient, flexible and highly innovative sterling settlement system for the United Kingdom’s high-value payments.  Moving to direct delivery of the HVPS is a vital part of that vision. Current delivery of HVPS The current delivery model for the UK HVPS involves a split in responsibilities across two institutions.  The core infrastructure is provided by the Bank, as part of its RTGS system. CHAPS Co, a small private sector company owned by its members is responsible for operating the system’s governance and rulebook and managing risks across the HVPS as a whole; CHAPS Co is supervised by the Bank of England.  This split is unusual internationally.  The norm in most countries is for the central bank to deliver all aspects of the HVPS.  There are structural deficiencies in this model that pose risks to financial stability.  The RTGS system has several policy functions, including the implementation of monetary policy. For security reasons therefore CHAPS Co cannot be given the full range of information on, or contractual control over, RTGS that it needs to identify and manage risks across the whole payment system.  This includes in important areas of operational risk such as cyber risk and fraud.  The IMF highlighted these constraints in its past two Financial Stability Assessment Programmes on the United Kingdom, most recently in 2016.  Such risks are increasingly important and complex.  Their potential impact is further amplified as new types of users have sought access to payment systems.  At the same time, the tolerance for even short periods of system outage has fallen.   CHAPS Co had made a number of important enhancements to the existing model in recent months to reflect some of these concerns.  But these enhancements could not fully address the structural constraints described above.  As such, CHAPS Co was unable to fully meet regulatory expectations. On this basis, the FPC concluded at its 27 April meeting that there were financial stability risks arising from the current structure for delivery of the HVPS, including from the growing threat from cyber attack. Direct delivery model for HVPS Under a direct delivery model, the Bank would be responsible for both the operation of the HVPS scheme and the RTGS infrastructure.  This would allow the Bank to carry out end-to-end risk management, identifying and responding to emerging risks in the HVPS in a holistic way, using the full range of tools at its disposal.  The Bank would maintain its role as the supervisor of the HVPS. The FPC welcomed the Bank’s plan to mitigate the financial stability risks through a move to the proposed direct delivery model for operating the HVPS.   The move towards a direct delivery model is an opportunity for the Bank to provide the FPC with more comprehensive information on the HVPS.  This is particularly important given the growing risk environment.  The FPC will be given regular reports on the extent of systemic risks arising from the operation of the HVPS.  In addition, where the Bank proposes material changes to the delivery of the HVPS in future that affect risks to financial stability, it will consult the FPC. The Bank has designed a model for the operation and supervision of the HVPS that will involve transparency, user voice and independent challenge.  The Bank, CHAPS Co and their stakeholders expect to complete the transition to direct delivery by the end of the calendar year. The RTGS renewal programme The move to direct delivery of the HVPS is part of a wider programme to reshape both the infrastructure and governance of the RTGS system.  The Bank published a blueprint for the new generation of its RTGS system in May 2017 (Table 1).   On 27 April, the FPC met to discuss the current structure for delivering the UK High-Value Payment System (HVPS), in the context of evolving risks to systemically important financial market infrastructure.  It agreed that there were financial stability risks arising from the current structure for delivery of the UK HVPS and welcomed the Bank’s plan to mitigate these risks through a move to the proposed direct delivery model (see Box 8). 40                                                                                                                                                          Financial Stability Report  June 2017 The renewed RTGS service will be delivered through a multi-year programme of work.  This includes the procurement of a new central infrastructure.  RTGS is vital UK infrastructure.  It supports both the UK economy and the Bank’s own balance sheet.  At the same time the renewal programme is complex, unique and large.  It will require co-ordinated changes across the payments industry.  It is critical that there are no disruptions to the RTGS service.  The Bank has planned accordingly;  new features will be introduced in phases.  The Bank’s current intention is for the majority of new functionality to be live by end-2020.

Part B The FPC’s medium-term priorities                                                                      41 To help to meet its objectives, alongside its ongoing assessment of the risk environment, the FPC is prioritising three initiatives over the next two to three years: (1) Finalising, and refining if necessary, post-crisis bank capital and liquidity reforms Over the past three years, in line with international reforms following the global financial crisis, the FPC has focused  on establishing the medium-term capital framework for  UK banks and has reviewed the Bank’s work to stop banks being ‘too big to fail’.   The FPC will now take stock of these reforms and will develop more ways to assess how resilient the banking system would be to shocks.  It will: • Review the judgements underlying its overall calibration of the risk-weighted capital framework for UK banks, including taking into account progress towards ensuring banks are resolvable, changes in accounting standards and reforms  to the measurement of risk-weighted assets.  The natural point for a full review will be in 2019, in light of the outcome of negotiations to finalise Basel III standards;   the FPC has already started reviewing some of these judgements. • Review the UK leverage ratio framework, in light of progress towards an international standard for a leverage requirement, and its scope of application. • Take stock of overall liquidity and funding standards for  UK banks and consider the case for a time-varying macroprudential liquidity standard.   • Input to the Bank’s work to develop its stress tests of the banking system, to capture better the interactions between banks in a stress.  (2) Completing post-crisis reforms to market-based finance in the United Kingdom, and improving the assessment of systemic risks across the financial system Firms other than banks play an important role in providing finance to the economy and a means of sharing risk.  Their activities can also be a source of systemic risk.  Since 2014,  the FPC has completed an annual review of risks from, and regulation of, market-based finance, with an in-depth look so far at the activities of open-ended investment funds and insurers, and on changes in market liquidity.  The FPC will now: • Continue its annual review and programme of in-depth reviews on specific market-based finance activities.  This will include an assessment of the financial stability risks associated with derivatives transactions, including progress towards implementation of the mandated move to the use of central clearing and other post-crisis reforms. • Support the Bank’s work to develop a system-wide stress simulation, to help understand how the financial system as a whole is likely to respond to shocks. • Consider whether macroprudential tools for market-based finance might be needed to address systemic risks originating from outside the banking system. (3) Preparing for the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union Exit negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union have begun.  There are a range of possible outcomes for, and paths to, the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union.   The FPC will oversee contingency planning to mitigate risks to financial stability as the withdrawal process evolves. Irrespective of the particular form of the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the European Union, and consistent with its statutory responsibility, the FPC will remain committed to the implementation of robust prudential standards in the UK financial system.  This will require a level of resilience to be maintained that is at least as great as that currently planned, which itself exceeds that required by international baseline standards. Across its priorities, the FPC remains committed to working with relevant authorities domestically and internationally, to protect and enhance the resilience of the UK financial system. The FPC’s medium-term priorities  42                                                                                                                                                          Financial Stability Report  June 2017 Recommendations implemented or withdrawn since the previous Report 14/Q2/1 FPC Recommendation on mortgage affordability tests  Superseded by 17/Q2/1 — see below When assessing affordability, mortgage lenders should apply an interest rate stress test that assesses whether borrowers could still afford their mortgages if, at any point over the first five years of the loan, Bank Rate were to be 3 percentage points higher than the prevailing rate at origination.  This Recommendation is intended to be read together with the FCA requirements around considering the effect of future interest rate rises as set out in MCOB 11.6.18(2). This Recommendation has been superseded by 17/Q2/1, to clarify the rate to which the 3 percentage points stress should be applied, following a review by the FPC.  Details of the review and the reasons for the clarification are set out in a chapter of this Report:  ‘The FPC’s approach to addressing risks from the UK mortgage market’.    This annex lists FPC Recommendations from previous periods that have been implemented since the previous Report, as well as Recommendations and Directions that are currently outstanding.   It also includes those FPC Policy decisions that have been implemented by rule changes and are therefore still in force.  Each Recommendation or Direction has been given an identifier to ensure consistent referencing over time.  For example, the identifier 14/Q2/1 refers to the first Recommendation made at the 2014 Q2 Committee meeting. Annex 1:  Previous macroprudential policy decisions 14/Q3/1 Powers of Direction over housing instruments Implemented The FPC recommends that HM Treasury exercise its statutory power to enable the FPC to direct, if necessary to protect and enhance financial stability, the PRA and FCA to require regulated lenders to place limits on residential mortgage lending, both owner-occupied and buy-to-let, by reference to:  (a) loan to value ratios;  and (b) debt to income ratios, including interest coverage ratios in respect of buy-to-let lending. Legislation granting the FPC powers of Direction over loan to value and debt to income limits in respect of mortgages on  owner-occupied properties came into force in April 2015. Over 2015 and 2016, HM Treasury consulted on granting the FPC powers of Direction over buy-to-let lending.  It published a consultation response document and laid the final legislation before Parliament on 16 November.  These powers were approved in December and are now in place.  The FPC therefore decided to consider this Recommendation as implemented at its meeting on 22 March 2017.                                                                                                                                                                 Annex 1 Previous macroprudential policy decisions                                                   43 Recommendations and Directions currently outstanding 17/Q2/1  FPC Recommendation on mortgage affordability tests Action under way When assessing affordability, mortgage lenders should apply an interest rate stress test that assesses whether borrowers could still afford their mortgages if, at any point over the first five years of the loan, their mortgage rate were to be 3 percentage points higher than the reversion rate specified in the mortgage contract at the time of origination (or, if the mortgage contract does not specify a reversion rate, 3 percentage points higher than the product rate at origination).  This Recommendation is intended to be read together with the FCA requirements around considering the effect of future interest rate rises as set out in MCOB 11.6.18(2).  This Recommendation applies to all lenders which extend residential mortgage lending in excess of £100 million per annum. This Recommendation was made at the FPC’s meeting on 21 June 2017.  Relative to the previous Recommendation on mortgage affordability tests (14/Q2/1), it clarified the rate to which the 3 percentage points stress should be applied and introduced a  de minimis threshold.  The explanation for this Recommendation is set out in a chapter of this Report:  ‘The FPC’s approach to addressing risks from the UK mortgage market’.    16/Q2/1 Distribution of capital to meet ‘fair shares’ of systemic buffers Implemented The FPC recommends to the PRA that it should seek to ensure that, where systemic buffers apply at different levels of consolidation, there is sufficient capital within the consolidated group, and distributed appropriately across it, to address both global systemic risks and domestic systemic risks. This Recommendation was made at the FPC’s May 2016 meeting to agree the final systemic risk buffer (SRB) framework.   Following a consultation in 2016 H2, the PRA published on 1 February 2017 its Policy Statement on the implementation of ringfencing.(1) This outlined how it would implement the FPC’s Recommendation.  The FPC therefore decided at its meeting on 22 March 2017 to consider this Recommendation as implemented, given that the PRA’s Policy Statement was in place. (1) www.bankofengland.co.uk/pra/Pages/publications/ps/2017/ps317.aspx.   15/Q2/3 CBEST vulnerability testing Implemented The FPC recommends that the Bank, the PRA and the FCA work with firms at the core of the UK financial system to ensure that they complete CBEST tests and adopt individual cyber resilience action plans.  The Bank, the PRA and the FCA should also establish arrangements for CBEST tests to become one component of regular cyber resilience assessment within the UK financial system. Since 2014, 31 out of 34 firms have finished testing, and two further firms are close to completion.  The first round of CBEST testing is therefore materially complete.  Consistent with the FPC’s Recommendation, CBEST will become a regular component of supervisory assessment of firms.  Financial services firms and market infrastructures at the core of the UK financial system will be expected to conduct their own regular tests of cyber resilience.  They will also be subject to supervisor-led CBEST testing at regular intervals.  The frequency of these tests will be proportionate to firms’ importance for financial stability.  CBEST is also being adopted in other jurisdictions and sectors.  Based on the progress made, the FPC judged at its meeting on 21 June 2017 that its 2015 Recommendation has been implemented.  The summary of the review is set out in a box in this Report:  ‘Building cyber resilience in the UK financial system’.  44                                                                                                                                                          Financial Stability Report  June 2017 Other FPC policy decisions which remain in place Set out below are previous FPC decisions, which remain in force, on the setting of its policy tools.  The calibration of these tools is kept under review.  Countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) The FPC is increasing the UK CCyB rate to 0.5%, from 0%, with binding effect from 27 June 2018.  Absent a material change in the outlook, and consistent with its stated policy for a standard risk environment and of moving gradually, the FPC expects to increase the rate to 1% at its November meeting, with binding effect a year after that.  This rate is reviewed on a quarterly basis.  The United Kingdom has also previously reciprocated a number of foreign CCyB decisions — for more details see the Bank of England website.(1) Under PRA rules, foreign CCyB rates applying from 2016 onwards will be automatically reciprocated up to and including 2.5%.   Recommendation on loan to income ratios In June 2014, the FPC made the following Recommendation (14/Q2/2): The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) should ensure that mortgage lenders do not extend more than 15% of their total number of new residential mortgages at loan to income ratios at or greater than 4.5.  This Recommendation applies to all lenders which extend residential mortgage lending in excess of £100 million per annum.  The Recommendation should be implemented as soon as practicable.  The PRA and the FCA have published their respective approaches to implementing this Recommendation:  the PRA has issued a Policy Statement, including rules,(2) and the FCA has issued general guidance. The FPC reviewed this Recommendation in November 2016 and decided not to amend the calibration.  The explanation for this is set out in the November 2016 Financial Stability Report.  (1) www.bankofengland.co.uk/ﬁnancialstability/Pages/fpc/ccbrates.aspx.  (2) www.bankofengland.co.uk/pra/Pages/publications/ps/2014/ps914.aspx.  Other FPC activities since the previous Report The Bank of England’s financial stability objective is to ‘protect and enhance the stability of the financial system of the United Kingdom’.  This is defined by Parliament, through the Bank of England Act 1998.  The Court of Directors of the Bank has a statutory responsibility to determine the Bank’s strategy in relation to this objective and to review it at least every three years. Court has delegated the review of the strategy to the FPC, as permitted by the Act;  but Court retains ultimate responsibility for the strategy.   At its 2017 Q2 meeting, the FPC agreed the Bank’s financial stability strategy, following its review of the strategy that was set by Court in 2014, and following consultation, as required by statute, with HM Treasury.  The strategy will be published in the Bank’s forthcoming Annual Report.

(b) If the series starts after 1987, the average between the start date and 2006 end and the maximum/minimum since the start date are used. (c) 2006 was the last year before the start of the global financial crisis. (d) The current vintage of ONS data is not available prior to 1997.  Data prior to this and beginning in 1987 have been assumed to remain unchanged since The Blue Book 2013. (e) Credit is defined as debt claims on the UK private non-financial sector.  This includes all liabilities of the household and not-for-profit sector except for the unfunded pension liabilities and financial derivatives of the not-for-profit sector, and private non-financial corporations’ (PNFCs’) loans and debt securities excluding direct investment loans and loans secured on dwellings.  The credit to GDP gap is calculated as the percentage point difference between the credit to GDP ratio and its long-term trend, where the trend is based on a one-sided Hodrick-Prescott filter with a smoothing parameter of 400,000.  See Countercyclical Capital Buffer Guide at www.bankofengland.co.uk/financialstability/Pages/fpc/coreindicators.aspx for further explanation of how this series is calculated.  Sources: BBA, ONS Revell, J and Roe, A (1971);  ‘National balance sheets and national accounting — a progress report’, Economic Trends, No. 211 and Bank calculations. (f) Twelve-month growth rate of nominal credit (defined as the four-quarter cumulative net flow of credit as a proportion of the stock of credit twelve months ago).  Credit is defined as above.  Sources:  ONS and Bank calculations. (g) As per cent of annual GDP (four-quarter moving sum).  Sources:  ONS and Bank calculations. (h) Ratios computed using a four-quarter moving sum of GDP.  Monetary financial institutions (MFIs) cover banks and building societies resident in the United Kingdom.  Sources:  ONS and Bank calculations. (i) As per cent of quarterly GDP.  Sources:  ONS and Bank calculations. (j) Five-year real interest rates five years forward, implied from inflation swaps and nominal fitted yields.  Data series runs from October 2004.  Sources:  Bloomberg and Bank calculations. (k) Measure of market expectations of 30-day volatility.  Conveyed by S&P 500 stock index option prices (one-month moving average).  Sources:  Bloomberg and Bank calculations. (l) Global corporate bond spreads’ refers to a one-month moving average of the global aggregate market non-financial corporate bond spread.  This tracks the performance of investment-grade corporate debt publicly issued in the global and regional markets from both developed and emerging market issuers.  Index constituents are weighted based on market value.  Spreads are option-adjusted (ie they show the number of basis points the  matched-maturity government spot curve needs to be shifted in order to match a bond’s present value of discounted cash flows).  Prior to 2016, published versions of this indicator showed the BofA Merrill Lynch Global  Industrial Index.  Sources:  Barclays and Bank calculations. (m) The household lending spread is a weighted average of mortgage and unsecured lending spreads, with weights based on relative volumes of new lending.  The mortgage spread is a weighted average of quoted mortgage rates over risk-free rates, using 90% LTV two-year fixed-rate mortgages and 75% LTV tracker, two and five-year fixed-rate mortgages.  Spreads are taken relative to gilt yields of matching maturity for fixed-rate products.  Spreads are taken relative to Bank Rate for the tracker product.  The unsecured component is a weighted average of spreads on credit cards, overdrafts and personal loans.  Spreads on unsecured lending are taken relative to Bank Rate.  FCA Product Sales Data includes regulated mortgage contracts only but is used to weight all mortgage products.  Series starts in 1997.  Sources:  Bank of England, Bloomberg, Council of Mortgage Lenders, FCA Product Sales Data and Bank calculations. (n) The UK corporate lending spread is a weighted average of:  SME lending rates over Bank Rate;  CRE average senior loan margins over Bank Rate;  and, as a proxy for the rate at which banks lend to large, non-CRE corporates, UK investment-grade company bond spreads over maturity-matched government bond yields (adjusted for any embedded option features such as convertibility into equity).  Weights are based on relative amounts outstanding of loans.  Series starts in October 2002.  Sources:  Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bank of England, Bloomberg, British Bankers’ Association, De Montfort University, Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and Bank calculations. (o) Unless otherwise stated, indicators are based on the major UK bank peer group defined as:  Abbey National (until 2003);  Alliance & Leicester (until 2007);  Bank of Ireland (from 2005);  Bank of Scotland (until 2000);  Barclays; Bradford & Bingley (from 2001 until 2007);  Britannia (from 2005 until 2008);  Co-operative Banking Group (from 2005);  Halifax (until 2000);  HBOS (from 2001 until 2008);  HSBC (from 1992);  Lloyds TSB/Lloyds Banking Group;  Midland (until 1991);  National Australia Bank (from 2005);  National Westminster (until 1999);  Nationwide;  Northern Rock (until 2011);  Royal Bank of Scotland;  Santander (from 2004);  TSB (until 1994);  Virgin Money (from 2012) and Woolwich (from 1990 until 1997).  Accounting changes, eg the introduction of IFRS in 2005 result in discontinuities in some series.  Restated figures are used where available. (p) Major UK banks’ aggregate core Tier 1 capital as a percentage of their aggregate risk-weighted assets.  The core Tier 1 capital ratio series starts in 2000 and uses the major UK banks peer group as at 2014 and their constituent predecessors.  Data exclude Northern Rock/Virgin Money from 2008.  From 2008, core Tier 1 ratios are as published by banks, excluding hybrid capital instruments and making deductions from capital based on PRA definitions. Prior to 2008, that measure was not typically disclosed and Bank calculations approximating it as previously published in the Financial Stability Report are used.  The series are annual until end-2012,  half-yearly until end-2013 and quarterly afterwards.  Sources:  PRA regulatory returns, published accounts and Bank calculations. (q) The Basel II series was discontinued with CRD IV implementation on 1 January 2014.  The ‘Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio’ is calculated as aggregate peer group common equity Tier 1 levels over aggregate risk-weighted assets, according to the CRD IV definition as implemented in the United Kingdom.  The Basel III peer group includes Barclays, Co-operative Banking Group, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide, RBS and Santander UK.  Sources:  PRA regulatory returns and Bank calculations. (r) A simple leverage ratio calculated as aggregate peer group equity (shareholders’ claims) over aggregate peer group assets over aggregate Basel 2010 leverage ratio exposure.  The Basel III (2014) series corresponds to aggregate peer group CRD IV end-point Tier 1 capital over aggregate Basel 2014 exposure measure.  Note that the simple series excludes Northern Rock/Virgin Money from 2008.  The Basel III series consists of Barclays, Co-operative Banking Group, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide, RBS and Santander UK.  The latest value uses latest published figures, in the case of Nationwide these relate to 2016 H1.  The series are annual until end-2012 and  half-yearly afterwards.  On 25 July 2016, the FPC recommended to the PRA that, when applying its rules on the leverage ratio, it considers allowing firms to exclude from the calculation of the total exposure measure those assets constituting claims on central banks where they are matched by deposits accepted by the firm that are denominated in the same currency and of identical or longer maturity.  No adjustment has been made to the calculated leverage ratio reported here for this policy.  Sources:  PRA regulatory returns, published accounts and Bank calculations.  (s) Aggregate end-year peer group risk-weighted assets divided by aggregate end-year peer group published balance sheet assets.  Data for 2014 H1 onwards are on a CRD IV basis.  Series begins in 1992 and is annual until end-2012 and half-yearly afterwards.  Latest published figures have been used, in the case of Nationwide, these relate to 2016 H1.  Sources:  Published accounts and Bank calculations. (t) Calculated as major UK banks’ annual profit before tax as a proportion of total assets, averaged over the current and previous year.  When banks in the sample have merged, aggregate profits for the year are approximated by those of the acquiring group.  Series is annual until 2015 when it becomes semi-annual.  The latest value uses latest published figures, in the case of Nationwide these relate to 2016 H1.  Sources:  Published accounts and Bank calculations. (u) Major UK banks’ loans and advances to customers as a percentage of customer deposits, where customer refers to all non-bank borrowers and depositors.  Repurchase agreements are excluded from loans and deposits where disclosed.  One weakness of the current measure is that it is not possible to distinguish between retail deposits from households and deposits placed by non-bank financial corporations on a consolidated basis.  Additional data collections would be required to improve the data in this area.  The series begins in 2000 and is annual until end-2012 and half-yearly afterwards.  The latest value uses latest published figures, in the case of Nationwide these relate to 2016 H1.  Sources:  Published accounts and Bank calculations. (v) Share of total funding (including capital) accounted for by wholesale funding with residual maturity of under three months.  Wholesale funding comprises deposits by banks, debt securities, subordinated liabilities and repo. Funding is proxied by total liabilities excluding derivatives and liabilities to customers under investment contracts.  Where underlying data are not published estimates have been used.  Repo includes repurchase agreements and securities lending.  The series starts in 2005.  In the latest value, Nationwide’s 2015 data are used as these are the latest published full-year results.  Sources:  Published accounts and Bank calculations. (w) This indicator highlights the countries where UK-owned monetary financial institutions’ (MFIs’) overall exposures are greater than 10% of UK-owned MFIs’ tangible equity on an ultimate risk basis and have grown by more than 1.5 times nominal GDP growth in that country.  Foreign exposures as defined in BIS consolidated banking statistics.  Uses latest data available, with the exception of tangible equity figures for 2006–07, which are estimated using published accounts.  Sources:  Bank of England, ECB, IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO), Thomson Reuters Datastream, published accounts and Bank calculations.

(y) Average of major UK banks’ five-year senior CDS premia, weighted by total assets until 2014 and by half-year total assets from 2015.  Series starts in 2003.  In the latest value Nationwide’s senior CDS is weighted by 2016 H1 total assets as the latest published figures relate to 2016 H1.  Sources:  Markit Group Limited, published accounts and Bank calculations. (z) Relates the share price with the book, or accounting, value of shareholders’ equity per share.  Averages of the ratios in the peer group, weighted by end-year total assets.  The sample comprises the major UK banks and National Australia Bank between 2005 and 2015 H2, excluding Britannia, Co-operative Banking Group, and Nationwide.  Northern Rock/Virgin Money is excluded from 2008.  Series starts in 2000.  Sources:  Thomson Reuters Datastream, published accounts and Bank calculations. (aa) Total peer group market capitalisation divided by total peer group assets (note a discontinuity due to introduction of IFRS accounting standards in 2005, which tends to reduce leverage ratios thereafter).  The sample comprises the major UK banks, excluding Britannia, Co-operative Banking Group and Nationwide.  National Australia Bank is included between 2005 and 2015 H2.  Northern Rock/Virgin Money is excluded from 2008.  Series starts in 2000. Sources:  Thomson Reuters Datastream, published accounts and Bank calculations. (ab) Sample consists of Barclays Group, Co-operative Banking Group, HSBC Holdings Group, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide Building Society Group, RBS Group, Santander UK Group and excludes Nationwide for 2008 H2 only. Average risk weights for residential mortgages (exposures on the Retail IRB method only) are calculated as total risk-weighted assets divided by total exposure value for all banks in the sample.  Calculated on a consolidated basis, except for Nationwide for 2014 H2/2015 H1 where only solo data were available.  Series starts in 2009 and is updated half-yearly.  Sources:  PRA regulatory returns and Bank calculations. (ac) Sample consists of Bank of Scotland, Barclays Bank, HSBC Bank, Lloyds Bank, National Westminster Bank, Nationwide, Santander UK, Co-operative Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Ulster Bank and excludes Nationwide for 2008 H2 only.  Average risk weights for residential mortgages (exposures on the Retail IRB method only) are calculated as total risk-weighted assets divided by total exposure value for all banks in the sample.  Calculated on an unconsolidated basis, Royal Bank of Scotland data includes National Westminster, Ulster Bank and RBS.  Historical data updated as of June 2016 to improve data series consistency.  Series starts in 2009 and is updated  half-yearly.  Sources:  PRA regulatory returns and Bank calculations. (ad) The disclosures the series are based on are not currently sufficient to ensure that all intra-financial activity is included in these series, nor is it possible to be certain that no real-economy activity is included.  Additional data collections would be required to improve the data in this area.  The intra-financial lending and borrowing growth series are adjusted for the acquisitions of Midland by HSBC in 1992, and of ABN AMRO by RBS in 2007 to avoid reporting large growth rates resulting from step changes in the size and interconnectedness of the major UK bank peer group.  Series exclude National Australia Bank. (ae) Lending to other banks and other financial corporations.  Growth rates are year on year.  Latest value shows growth rate for year to 2016 H2.  Data point excludes National Australia Bank.  Sources:  Published accounts and Bank calculations.  (af) Wholesale borrowing, composed of deposits from banks and non-subordinated securities in issue.  Growth rates are year-on-year.  Latest value shows growth rate for year to 2016 H2.  Data point excludes National Australia Bank.  One weakness of the current measure is that it is not possible to distinguish between retail deposits and deposits placed by non-bank financial institutions on a consolidated basis.  Sources:  Published accounts and Bank calculations.  (ag) Based on notional value of derivatives (some of which may support real economy activity).  The sample includes Barclays, HSBC and RBS who account for a significant share of UK banks’ holdings of derivatives, though the sample could be adjusted in the future should market shares change.  Series starts in 2002.  Growth rates are year on year.  Latest value shows growth rate for year to 2016 H2.  Sources:  Published accounts and Bank calculations.  (ah) This indicator highlights the countries where UK-owned MFIs’ non-bank private sector exposures are greater than 10% of UK-owned MFIs’ tangible equity on an ultimate risk basis and have grown by more than 1.5 times nominal GDP growth in that country.  Foreign exposures as defined in BIS consolidated banking statistics.  Overseas sectoral exposures cannot currently be broken down further at the non-bank private sector level.  The intention is to divide them into households and corporates as new data become available.  Uses latest data available, with the exception of tangible equity figures for 2006–07, which are estimated using published accounts.  Sources: Bank of England, ECB, IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO), Thomson Reuters Datastream, published accounts and Bank calculations. (ai) The twelve month growth rate of nominal credit.  Defined as the four quarter cumulative net flow of credit divided by the stock of credit twelve months ago.

Sources:  ONS and Bank calculations. (aj) Four-quarter growth rate of UK-resident MFIs’ loans to the real estate sector.  The real estate sector is defined as:  buying, selling and renting of own or leased real estate;  real estate and related activities on a fee or contract basis;  and development of buildings.  Non seasonally adjusted.  Quarterly data.  Data cover lending in both sterling and foreign currency from 1998 Q4.  Prior to this period, data cover sterling only.  Source:  Bank of England. (ak) Gross debt as a percentage of a four-quarter moving sum of gross disposable income of the UK household and non-profit sector.  Includes all liabilities of the household sector except for the unfunded pension liabilities and financial derivatives of the non-profit sector.  Disposable income is adjusted for financial intermediation services indirectly measured (FISIM) and changes in pension entitlements.  Sources:  ONS and Bank calculations. (al) Gross debt as a percentage of a four-quarter moving sum of gross operating surplus.  Gross debt is measured as loans and debt securities excluding derivatives, direct investment loans and loans secured on dwellings.  The corporate gross operating surplus series is adjusted for FISIM.  Sources:  ONS and Bank calculations. (am)Gross debt as a percentage of four-quarter moving sum of nominal GDP.  The NBFI sector includes all financial corporations apart from monetary financial institutions (ie deposit taking institutions).  This indicator additionally excludes insurance companies and pension funds.  Sources:  ONS and Bank calculations. (an) Ratio between an average of the seasonally adjusted Halifax and Nationwide house price indices and RPI housing rent.  The series is rebased so that the average between 1987 and 2006 is 100.

FCA Product Sales Data includes regulated mortgage contracts only.  Series starts in 2005.  Sources:  FCA Product Sales Data and Bank calculations. (aq) Average of the maximum offered loan to value ratios across major CRE lenders.  Series starts in 2002.  Sources:  De Montfort University and Bank calculations. (ar) The residential mortgage lending spread is a weighted average of quoted mortgage rates over risk-free rates, using 90% LTV two-year fixed-rate mortgages and 75% LTV tracker, two and five-year fixed-rate mortgages.

(c)  2006 was the last year before the global financial crisis. (d) Mean LTV (respectively LTI) ratio on new advances above the median LTV (LTI) ratio, based on loans to first-time buyers, council/registered social tenants exercising their right to buy and homemovers, and excluding lifetime mortgages and advances with LTV ratio above 130% (LTI above 10x).  FCA Product Sales Data includes regulated mortgage contracts only.  Series starts in 2005.  Sources:  FCA Product Sales Data and Bank calculations. (e) Estimated mean LTV ratio of new non-regulated lending advances, of which buy-to-let is 88% by value.  The figures include further advances and remortgages.  The raw data is categorical:  the share of mortgages with LTV ratio less than 75%;  between 75% and 90%;  between 90% and 95%;  and greater than 95%.  An approximate mean is calculated by giving these categories weights using the average LTV in equivalent buckets in loan level  buy-to-let data gathered by the Council of Mortgage Lenders.  Series starts in 2007.  Council of Mortgage Lenders data available from 2014;  weights prior to this date are average LTVs across the respective buckets using all data gathered in 2014.  The share of mortgages with LTV ratio at 75% from 2014 onwards used are adjusted to estimate the LTV of each loan before any fees or charges are added.  This approximates the LTV at which the loan was originated.  Source:  Bank of England, Council of Mortgage Lenders and Bank calculations. (f) The twelve month growth rate of nominal credit.  Defined as the four-quarter cumulative net flow of credit divided by the stock of credit twelve months ago.  Credit is defined as all liabilities of the household and not-for-profit sector except for the unfunded pension liabilities and financial derivatives of the not-for-profit sector.  Sources:  ONS and Bank calculations. (g) Gross debt as a percentage of a four-quarter moving sum of gross disposable income of the UK household and non-profit sector.  Includes all liabilities of the household sector except for the unfunded pension liabilities and financial derivatives of the non-profit sector.  Disposable income is adjusted for financial intermediation services indirectly measured (FISIM) and changes in pension entitlements.  Sources:  ONS and Bank calculations. (h) Total debt secured on dwellings as a percentage of a four-quarter moving sum of gross disposable income of the UK household and non-profit sector.  Disposable income is adjusted for FISIM and changes in pension entitlements. Sources:  ONS and Bank calculations. (i) Total debt associated with owner-occupier mortgages divided by the four-quarter moving sum of gross disposable income of the UK household and non-profit sector.  Disposable income is adjusted for FISIM and changes in pension entitlements.  Owner-occupier mortgage debt estimated by multiplying aggregate household debt secured on dwellings by the share of mortgages on lender balances that are not buy-to-let loans.  Series starts in 1999. Sources:  Council of Mortgage Lenders, ONS and Bank calculations. (j) Data are for monthly number of house purchase approvals covering sterling lending by UK MFIs and other lenders to UK individuals.  Approvals secured on dwellings are measured net of cancellations.  Seasonally adjusted.   Series starts in 1993.  Source:  Bank of England. (k)  The number of houses sold/bought in the current month is sourced from HMRC’s Land Transaction Return.  From 2008 the Return excluded properties priced at less than £40,000 (2006 and 2007 data have also been revised by HMRC to correct for this).  Data prior to 2005 comes from the Survey of Property Transactions;  the UK total figure is computed by assuming that transactions in the rest of the United Kingdom grew in line with England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Seasonally adjusted.  Sources:  Council of Mortgage Lenders, HMRC and Bank calculations. (l)   The number of new mortgages advanced for house purchase in the current month.  Buy-to-let series starts in 2001.  There are structural breaks in the series in April 2005 where the Council of Mortgage Lenders switches source. Data prior to 2002 are at a quarterly frequency.  Sources:  Council of Mortgage Lenders and Bank calculations. (m)The share of new owner-occupied mortgages advanced for house purchase that are interest only.

(r) The overall spread on residential mortgage lending is a weighted average of quoted mortgage rates over risk-free rates, using 90% LTV two-year fixed-rate mortgages and 75% LTV tracker, two and five-year fixed-rate mortgages. Spreads are taken relative to gilt yields of matching maturity for fixed-rate products.  Spreads are taken relative to Bank Rate for the tracker product.  Weights are based on relative volumes of new lending.  The difference in spread between high and low LTV lending is the rate on 90% LTV two-year fixed-rate mortgages less the 75% LTV two-year fixed-rate.  Series starts in 1997.  FCA Product Sales Data includes regulated mortgage contracts only. Sources:  Bank of England, Bloomberg, Council of Mortgage Lenders, FCA Product Sales Data and Bank calculations. (s) The spread on new buy-to-let mortgages is the weighted average effective spread charged on new floating and fixed-rate non-regulated mortgages over safe rates.  Spreads are taken relative to Bank Rate for the floating-rate products.  The safe rate for fixed-rate mortgages is calculated by weighting two-year, three-year and five-year gilts by the number of buy-to-let fixed-rate mortgage products offered at these maturities.  Series starts in 2007.
